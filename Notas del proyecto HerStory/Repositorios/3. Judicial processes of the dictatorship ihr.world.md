**[The central database](https://scwd.ihr.world/en/)** is our main project. We compile and then republish **data** in order to provide access to information on **the Spanish Civil War** and **the Franco Regime**, with particular regard to victims of repression and reprisal. We also publish articles about the Spanish Second Republic, the Spanish Civil War and Francoist Spain. Innovación y Derechos Humanos (**I**nnovation and **H**uman **R**ights) is a non-profit organization. Our goals are to defend and promote the right of access to information and to archives, as well as to publicise the importance of archives and of historical research.
