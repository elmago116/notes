INTRODUCTION Interdisciplinary research produces more impactful results than mono-disciplinary research [1], and the role of academic libraries is to support such efforts. This study proposes an extensible knowledge graph (KG) designed to aggregate information necessary for establishing interdisciplinary research collaborations and supporting interdisciplinary PhD education. This case study grounds in an interdisciplinary PhD program in Communication and Information Sciences (CIS) at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, with the objective to produce a helpful tool for the doctoral student population and other interested parties. Academic librarians can support students and faculty in building and maintaining these knowledge networks. METHOD We applied a Human-Centered-Design Approach and involved interdisciplinary CIS PhD students in every stage of the research. Following figure outlines the overall research approach: CIS KNOWLEDGE GRAPH MODEL GRAPH DATA SOURCES REFERENCES [1] Fortunato S, Bergstrom CT, Börner K, Evans JA, Helbing D, Milojević S, et al.

Presented at VIS 2023; 2023.; Available from: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01311 FINDINGS IMPLICATIONS ● Innovative methodology applied to KG design - a blueprint for community engagement design ● KG model (extensible) for interdisciplinary research collaboration (e.g. in iSchools) ● Improves visibility and, consequently, the accountability of activities of all involved in a domain [4] ● Reduces uncertainty and academic stress within doctoral student population based on data driven decision making especially when selecting faculty to work with [5] ● User-generated queries successfully anticipated new student information needs [6] ● Can be used to create an archive of people’s activities and experiences for an academic unit (or university) DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT The KG dataset (with publicly available data only) and the Neo4J Bloom styling available via FigShare: https://bit.ly/45dPWK3 1) Requirements Gathering Stage [2] ● CIS PhD students rely on people to get information, yet there are not enough opportunities for exchange ● Different information seeking styles for International and US students ● Timeline is important (stage of the program, progress check) 2) Graph & Visualization Design Stage [3] Participatory approach to defining graph categories and attributes to support capturing and exploration of: ● Institutional knowledge ● Personal student experiences (including Privacy labels) ● Faculty activities and research interests ● Building social connections ● Students’ Progress check and comparison ● Clearly defined questions of interest for the population 3) Evaluation Stage (showing the queries with Neo4J Bloom) ● “ Useful” & “ Helpful”; supports specific curiosity & exploratory search ● Good for planning for success (comparing with other students paths) ● Valuable information not else available (students’ reflections on courses & exams) ● Aggregated information saves time ● Anticipates the user needs -> “It answers questions I didn’t know I had” ● Lacks qualitative aspect, but allows to discover people to talk to about these topics Example Query: Faculty from different departments with publications (pink) in “Human-Computer Interaction” research area Example Query: Co-authorship network of CIS-afﬁliated faculty, students, and alumni Data was manually collected and inserted to Neo4J Graph Database","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
