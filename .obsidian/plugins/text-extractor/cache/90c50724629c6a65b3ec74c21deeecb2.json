Introduction Wikipedia is a widely used educational resource with billions of readers in numerous languages, created through open collaboration. Despite its achievements, Wikipedia suffers from a persistent gender bias with a low percentage of content on women and few female editors (Hinnosaar, 2019; Wagner et al., 2016). This gender bias is exacerbated in some Wikipedia editions, such as the Italian or Catalan versions, due to decisions about gender- related categories that should provide access and visualization of content related to gender identities. In these cases, categories like “woman” or “non-binary person” are prohibited for the organization of content and thus information retrieval. These community-based decisions lead to some dysfunctions, which are particularly critical in languages that use grammatical gender, such as Catalan and Italian. Addressing this bias is important for providing equitable information retrieval and knowledge representation. In the digital age, knowledge organization systems (KOSs) encompass a range of critical tools such as classification systems, thesauri, lexical databases, ontologies, gazetteers and taxonomies. These KOSs have assumed an increasingly pivotal role in the realm of information management and diverse applications. Their primary function is to meticulously convey semantics, accomplishing a multifaceted array of functions. First and foremost, KOSs are indispensable for representing and indexing information and documents. They provide a structured framework that aids in the organization and retrieval of information. Furthermore, KOSs act as knowledge-based assistants for information seekers, guiding them through the intricacies of data. They serve as semantic guides across various domains and fields, facilitating a deeper understanding of complex subject matter. In addition, KOSs function as communication tools, furnishing a conceptual framework that bridges the gap between experts and non-experts, ensuring a common language for effective communication. Moreover, they offer a foundational structure for knowledge-driven systems, enabling the seamless integration of data and knowledge in various applications (Zeng and Mayr, 2018). KOSs are pivotal in structuring and classifying vast amounts of information in our digital age. Prominent examples of these systems can be found in Wikipedia and Wikidata. However, evaluating these knowledge organization structures, known as taxonomies in Wikipedia and ontologies in Wikidata, remains a complex challenge. There is currently no established methodology for determining the optimal indicators and metrics required for the comprehensive assessment of these structures. The creation of these metrics often relies on the specific context of the study, which can introduce subjectivity and inconsistency into the assessment process. This academic paper conducts an in-depth examination of taxonomies and ontologies in Wikipedia and Wikidata. The primary objective is to establish a methodology for evaluating these systems, quantifying categorization issues in Wikipedia, and assessing Wikidata’s suitability. It also aims to reduce the gender gap on Wikipedia by visualizing gender diversity from Wikidata. While Wikipedia has limited gender categories, Wikidata provides a broader range, including agender, intersex, nonbinary, transgender and more. The connection between Wikipedia and Wikidata is notable. Wikidata faces a unique challenge in structuring gender data. While Wikipedia confines itself to male and female categories (in some editions, only the male category), Wikidata’s property 21 encompasses a wide array of gender classes, including agender, female, male, intersex, nonbinary, transgender female and transgender male, among others. A preexisting connection exists between Wikipedia and Wikidata, with Wikidata serving as an integral component of Wikipedia’s infrastructure. Furthermore, the utilization of ontologies to enhance information organization and retrieval in Wikipedia is evident in specific cases, such as the management of the “living people” category. Assessing knowledge organization systems 125 In this challenge about gender data, an essential discussion concerning gender and sex, particularly regarding Property talk:P21 (Wikidata, 2024) has surfaced. Concerns have arisen regarding the conflation between sex and gender within a single category on Wikidata. There is a call for distinct properties to differentiate sex, gender and potentially gender identity, similar to having separate properties for height and weight. The text highlights issues related to the vague and unclear classification of terms like male, female, man and woman. It is suggested to have a separate property and values for gender identity, distinct from biological sex, with clear and unambiguous definitions to avoid intentional conflation that causes problems with dataset clarity and unambiguous representation. Furthermore, it discusses similar concerns in official contexts, such as the discussion initiated by the UK government in 2018 regarding managing gender or sex statements, indicating parallel challenges faced by both Wikidata and the government. Additionally, unresolved situations related to the assignment of property values are pointed out, including issues with assigning “male” to someone who is biologically female, questioning the differentiation between human males and non-human males, confusion between transsexualism and gender identity disorder (GID), and the need for more accurate representation of values such as “intersex” and “transgender.” Furthermore, it is noted that special situations, such as assigning gender to anthropomorphic nonhumans and dealing with unknown gender, have not been adequately resolved. The necessity of incorporating a “citation needed” constraint to the property, requiring at least one reference for value assignment, is also analyzed. On a related note, the inappropriate addition of sex or gender statements for living individuals via Quickstatements or bots on Wikidata, leading to harmful misgendering and potential privacy violations, is brought up. Proposed solutions to prevent future harm include disallowing bots and Quickstatements from affecting more than ten items at a time and discouraging the use of labels and given names as references for sex and gender statements. These proposals aim to ensure more careful handling of sex and gender statements to avoid harm and privacy violations, reflecting the community’s concerns with promoting responsible and ethical practices on Wikidata. Finally, this paper evaluates the KOS using the Catalan Wikipedia as a case study on the gender gap. It seeks to improve gender identity visualization and accessibility through Wikidata ontologies. It acknowledges potential biases in Wikidata and Wikipedia and their capacity to perpetuate real-world biases. Furthermore, it is essential to acknowledge that Wikidata’s potential biases are no greater than those present in the real world (Zhang and Terveen, 2021). Additionally, some authors argue that Wikipedia mirrors real-world biases (Eckert and Steiner, 2013) with the platform having the capacity to perpetuate and exacerbate gender gaps, shaped not only by editors but also by infrastructural logics (Ford and Wajcman, 2017). The objective is to evaluate Wikipedia’s taxonomy and Wikidata’s ontologies to enhance gender diversity visibility. The paper synthesizes theories and insights to establish comprehensive evaluation criteria. The ultimate aim is to provide an objective approach to assess KOSs in Wikipedia and Wikidata and quantify their structural effectiveness. Subsequent sections will detail the evaluation process and findings, addressing Wikidata’s potential as a solution for Wikipedia’s categorization challenges. 2. Literature review In this section, we provide a comprehensive review following the SALSA framework (Grant and Booth, 2009) to examine the gender gap in Wikipedia and Wikidata. Academic research has extensively investigated the gender gap in both platforms. The Wikipedia appraisal stage involved 97 articles, and the Wikidata appraisal involved 34. A total amount of 21 articles were used to assess Wikipedia (Ferran-Ferrer et al., 2023), and 19 were used to evaluate Wikidata. JD 80,7 126 2.1 Gender gap in Wikipedia The gender gap on Wikipedia has been the subject of extensive academic research, with numerous studies exploring biases in content, participation, reading and potential strategies to address this gap. These studies emphasize the importance of recognizing and addressing biases and barriers to create a more diverse and inclusive Wikipedia community (Ferran-Ferrer et al., 2023). The under-representation of women as editors and as subjects of biographical coverage is a widely recognized issue in the academic field (Hube, 2017; Falenska et al., 2021). Some articles discuss how gender bias intersects with race, sexuality, security and marginalization on Wikipedia (Lam et al., 2011; Ju and Stewart, 2019; Tripodi, 2023). Various factors, such as the demographics of editors, platform structure and cultural values, contribute to these biases, which have significant social implications, affecting the visibility and participation of women and perpetuating existing disparities (Ford and Wajcman, 2017). Regarding the gender gap in content, research reveals that women are underrepresented among the main figures in all language editions of Wikipedia (Miquel-Ribe and Laniado, 2021). Articles for deletion is a possibility within the decision-making process in Wikipedia article editing. It is the process that determines what constitutes knowledge and what does not in the encyclopedia. Biographies of women and LGBTQþ individuals are often subject to deletion, resulting in a higher proportion of biographies of women nominated for deletion compared to biographies available about men (Morgan et al., 2013; Hollink et al., 2018; Tripodi, 2023). While there are indications of bias, some authors conclude that there is no clear bias resulting from deletion activity (Worku et al., 2020). Studies also identify significant gender differences in Wikipedia content, such as biographies of women featuring more prominent family, gender and relationship themes (Wagner et al., 2016). Linguistic bias in terms of language abstraction and positivity can be observed, along with structural differences in metadata and hypertext links. In addition, citation practices reveal that female authors are cited less than expected, suggesting a preference for citing male publications (Zheng et al., 2022). These biases may further marginalize female authors, especially in non-Anglophone countries. The gender gap in content creation and participation on Wikipedia perpetuates an unbalanced coverage of topics, creating a cycle where the lack of diversity in content fails to attract and engage different editors, thus exacerbating the existing gender gap (Konieczny and Klein, 2018). Research on the gender gap in editing and participation highlights various barriers that hinder women’s involvement on Wikipedia. These barriers include negative reputation, lack of recognition, fear of deletion, rejection and alienation. Often, research suggests that women lack confidence in their abilities, feel uncomfortable with editing and face negative responses to constructive feedback (Collier and Bear, 2012). Factors such as the digital skills gap (Gardner, 2011) and the availability of time for editing (Gruwell, 2015) also contribute to the gender gap. However, visible female editors and constructive comments can help mitigate the gap, as the presence of visible female peers promotes collaborative editing (Evans et al., 2015). Some authors have investigated the gender gap in Germany and suggested a proactive approach to training and educating women to enhance their motivation for writing (Buchem and Kloppenburg, 2013). It has also been highlighted the impact of family responsibilities on women’s ability to write, so efforts may need to focus on addressing gender disparities in domestic work (Ferran-Ferrer et al., 2021). The gender gap extends beyond editing and includes the underrepresentation of individuals. Female participation varies by topic, with a greater presence in gender studies or feminism categories, reflecting traditional gender stereotypes. Generic site restrictions limit the digital credibility and authority of women, hindering their contributions. The complex relationship between the gender gap and harassment requires better understanding, and it is important to create a safe environment for women on and off Wikipedia. Feminist interventions, such as exclusive edit-a-thons for women, have proven effective in countering gender inequality on the platform. Assessing knowledge organization systems 127 2.2 Gender and Wikidata The gender gap on Wikidata has been extensively explored in academic research. We can delineate three main categories of studies. A first set of research has delved into the gender gap within Wikidata, presenting diverse methodologies, findings, and recommendations to address this disparity. Meanwhile, a second set aims to quantitatively assess the biographical gender gap in Wikipedia, across various language editions, leveraging Wikidata’s multilingual support to facilitate this cross-cultural research. Lastly, a third set of studies emphasize the advocacy and visibility of content pertaining to women in industries traditionally dominated by men, utilizing Wikidata for this purpose. Regarding the initial group of discussions aimed at presenting diverse methodologies, findings and recommendations to address this disparity, Zhang and Terveen (2021) delved into the gender content gap in Wikidata, seeking to uncover the source of bias. Through a quantitative case study, they examined how individuals were represented in Wikidata compared to existing gender biases. Their findings revealed a prevalence of male-dominated professions among the most frequently represented categories, closely mirroring real-world gender distribution. Similarly, Abi\u0001an, Mero~no-Pe~nuela and Simperl (2022) sought to understand the impact of content gaps in knowledge graphs on downstream applications, with a particular focus on gender disparities within Wikidata. To achieve this, they introduced a framework that compared edit metrics with Wikipedia pageviews, facilitating a quantitative evaluation of discrepancies between knowledge graph content and user needs. As a result, they identified no inherent gender or recency gaps within Wikidata’s production, with only a few under- represented entities standing out. A group of articles has focused on analyzing gender bias on Wikidata concerning occupations or professional domains. In this line, Das et al. (2019) conducted a holistic analysis of bias measurement on the knowledge graph, specifically focusing on biases in Wikidata across different demographics selected from seven continents. They utilized extensive experiments on a wide range of occupations sampled from various demographics, examining the impact of algorithm bias on the measurement of biased occupations. Results indicated that the inherent data bias in Wikidata can be influenced by specific algorithm bias and underscored the importance of understanding biases based on sociocultural differences across demographics. Within this same field, there are three works that concentrate on specific occupations or professional domains: Lemus-Rojas and Lee (2019) in the STEM fields, Zhu et al. (2023) in Chinese culture and heritage, and Conroy (2023) in French and Francophone literature. The outcomes align with the conclusions observed in the aforementioned comprehensive studies. In the first two cases, Wikidata is highlighted as a critical collection for enhancing the visibility of women. Conroy (2023) found that the gender gap in both subsets closely resembles the global average, with a higher-than-average representation of writers of other genders. Finally, Pellissier and Suchanek (2019) and Bourli and Pitoura (2020) analyzed gender bias on Wikidata through advanced automated processing techniques. Pellissier and Suchanek (2019) proposed a system to index changes in the Wikidata graph and enable users to answer complex SPARQL queries regarding historical changes, while Bourli and Pitoura (2020) introduced measures for identifying bias in the dataset, tested methods for amplifying bias in embeddings, and introduced a debiasing approach. A special case is Mandiberg and Sarıo\u0003glu (2022), who aimed to address the challenges associated with defining a dataset to analyze changes in Wikipedia’s gender gap for articles about visual art. The dataset is constructed from the intersection between Wikipedia and Wikidata. The researchers describe the process of using a topic model algorithm to identify a dataset by analyzing the words within each article and grouping articles into topics. Their aim was to create a dataset that more closely reflects visual artists’ articles on English Wikipedia, addressing potential systemic biases. The topic model algorithm provided a dataset that encompassed a majority of the two JD 80,7 128 WikiProject datasets and the Wikidata sets, while adding additional art-related individuals. It was found to be superior to other options, offering a detailed list of articles about visual arts that mitigated Wikipedia’s existing imbalances. The study also highlighted challenges in Wikidata’s taxonomies and called for further research on systemic biases reflected in taxonomy systems. A second set of articles addresses the application of Wikidata, capitalizing on its multilingual capabilities to facilitate comprehensive cross-cultural research, for measuring gender bias in Wikipedia editions and for resolving this issue. Three of these studies feature contributions from Maximilian Klein and Piotr Konieczny. Klein and Konieczny (2015) and Konieczny and Klein (2018) introduce the Wikipedia Gender Inequality Indicator (WIGI) developed from Wikidata. WIGI calculates, for each country, a score based on the ratio of female and nonbinary gendered biographies to the total number of biographies. This Wikipedia-derived indicator is correlated with four contemporary, widespread gender inequality indices (GDI, GEI, GGGI and SIGI). Through analyzing methodologies and the relationship with Wikipedia data, evidence suggests that the bias in Wikipedia’s biographical coverage is aligned with gender bias in socially powerful positions. Concerning the results, Klein and Konieczny (2015) find that the strongest correlations are with individuals born around 1,910, indicating that Wikipedia’s representation may more accurately reflect current rather than historical gender statuses. The same authors Konieczny and Klein (2018) utilize cultural clusters to highlight how gender inequality can be examined through diverse cultural perspectives. Klein et al. (2016) delve deeper into the gender bias of content, focusing on women’s biographies on Wikipedia. The article underscores the importance of precisely measuring the gender content gap and the critical examination of initiatives intended to mitigate this disparity. The team formulates the Wikidata Human Gender Indicators (WHGI), a robust, longitudinal dataset to monitor gender disparities. It monitors biographical data across multiple facets – such as time, geography, culture, occupation and language – providing an extensive instrument for elucidating and quantifying the gender bias in Wikipedia’s content. The research signals a changing representation of women in 11 dimensions utilizing WHGI. Validations against three external datasets back the indicator’s accuracy, and reassessment of Wikipedia’s gender bias with WHGI suggests that it could enhance depth and impact in future research on the subject. In a similar line of work, Hollink et al. (2018) tackle the challenge of measuring gender inequalities on Wikipedia, especially when considering multiple languages. The difficulty in finding objective methods to measure and compare gender inequality is underlined, and the potential differences across language editions of Wikipedia are acknowledged. Their methodology focuses on comparing coverage of male and female Members of the European Parliament (MEP) across various Wikipedia language editions using open data. This approach allows for a fair comparison due to the MEPs’ notable actions in the real world, and it examines gender discrepancies in both the coverage on Wikipedia and the content within Wikidata entries. An analysis of Wikidata entries for male and female MEPs reveals equal amounts of property-value pairs, contradicting earlier studies that found Wikipedia content related to women emphasized family and relationships. Differences related to real-world disparities suggest that the structured data of Wikidata might be less prone to bias. Moreover, aggregation of data from various Wikipedia language editions might contribute to a more diversified and equitable dataset in Wikidata. Delving into the characteristics and virtues of Wikidata, Hermoso Pulido (2021) discuss how Wikidata has become a significant tool within the Wikimedia ecosystem, improving data linkage and reuse. Specifically, it mentions the adoption of Wikidata in Catalan Wikipedia, noting how its integration with infoboxes and list generation has advanced the project. The article suggests that such technical innovations could be part of the solution in addressing Assessing knowledge organization systems 129 Wikipedia’s gender gap. Methodology highlights the use of structured data from Wikidata to evaluate new biographical articles, aiming to encourage user engagement in diversity issues and track vandalism or errors. This methodology suggests a proactive approach to using structured data for maintaining quality and diversity in biographical content, directly impacting the reduction of Wikipedia’s gender gap. Technical challenges are highlighted, such as execution timeouts during SPARQL queries for live data analysis. While some limitations exist for large datasets, initiatives like WCDO show promise in identifying and acting upon content gaps. The article advocates for enhanced cross-collaboration between Wikidata and Wikipedia, suggesting that embedding certain tools could encourage editors to address discrepancies more effectively. Leveraging the potential of Wikidata, Laouenan et al. (2022) focus on studying different intersectionalities, specifically, they aim to construct a comprehensive and accurate database of notable individuals by cross-verifying the information from various editions of Wikipedia and Wikidata, focusing on specific social science questions about gender, economic growth, urban and cultural development. The researchers collected a significant amount of data from Wikipedia and Wikidata, utilizing deduplication techniques and cross-verifying the retrieved information. They found varying degrees of completeness and error rates dependent on notability distribution, classifying the presence of an Anglo-Saxon bias in the English edition of Wikipedia. The strategy resulted in the creation of a cross-verified database of 2.29 million individuals, shedding light on an Anglo-Saxon bias in the English edition of Wikipedia. The study also emphasized the implications of this bias and identified individuals not present in the English edition of Wikipedia. Finally, the last research strand in this set of papers aims to emphasize the promotion and visibility of content related to women in male-dominated professional spheres through the utilization of Wikidata. Among these, two articles are authored by Thornton and Seals-Nutt, both affiliated with the Stories Services Collaborative. Thornton and Seals-Nutt (2018) introduce the creation of a web application called Science Stories. This application utilizes structured data from Wikidata along with images to narrate compelling science stories, especially focusing on the experiences of women who have contributed to scientific research. The primary goal is to elevate the visibility of these women. The authors illustrate how the use of free software and open standards can lead to the development of visually captivating and interactive science communication experiences. These experiences involve the integration of images with structured statements within a web of interconnected data, all supported by references to published sources. Four articles focus on leveraging Wikidata to promote and illuminate the contributions of women in male-dominated professional fields. In a similar vein, Thornton et al. (2022) delve into how Semantic Web capabilities can consolidate disparate materials to craft narratives, as demonstrated by the WeChangEd research project, which centers on women editors of periodicals in Europe from 1710 to 1920. The methodology involves developing applications that aggregate data from Wikidata to harness a versatile knowledge graph, facilitating the swift creation of interactive platforms to captivate fresh audiences. The outlined process holds potential value for researchers and cultural heritage institutions seeking web-based avenues for presenting data-driven storytelling. 3. Objectives The main aim of this research is to explore and compare the effectiveness and efficiency of the KOS of female biographies on Wikipedia and non-male ones. This will be accomplished by evaluating the category structure of the Catalan edition of Wikipedia and the ontology of Wikidata, with the aim of addressing the challenge of visualizing the diversity of gender identities and accessing their content on Wikipedia. We will aim to ascertain whether JD 80,7 130 Wikidata ontologies can offer a more improved means of organizing and representing the information available on Wikipedia regarding the diversity of gender identities. Therefore, the research questions that we will address are as follows: RQ1. How can a standards inspection method be developed to evaluate the conformance of the KOS in Wikipedia with international specifications and standards established by recognized organizations? RQ2. How does the category scheme of the Catalan edition of Wikipedia impact the effectiveness and efficiency of retrieving articles related to women and non-male genders, and what specific limitations does it present? RQ3. To what extent does the Wikidata ontology facilitate the effective and efficient retrieval of articles concerning women and non-male genders, and what advantages or enhancements does it offer in comparison to the Wikipedia category scheme? To address these questions, a specific methodology is created and applied for each of the specific objectives (see Table 1). 4. Methodology To explore the nature of Wikipedia as a taxonomy, as opposed to a folksonomy, and provide insights into Wikidata’s data model, it is documented in Centelles and Ferran-Ferrer (2024). 4.1 Inspection of standards and guidelines for the evaluation of taxonomy (Wikipedia) and ontologies (Wikidata) Our study begins by reviewing the most widely accepted standards for the analysis of KOSs, and using them as the basis for designing an evaluation guide tailored to the taxonomic and ontological criteria relevant to Wikipedia and Wikidata. Subsequently, we employed a standards inspection method to assess whether the KOSs of Wikipedia and Wikidata conform to the international specifications and standards defined by recognized organizations. In the theoretical framework of our study, we draw upon the taxonomic classification proposal of (Souza et al., 2012) and the critical insights of Mazzocchi (2018) into KOS. These foundational works underpin our proposed evaluation criteria for Wikipedia and Wikidata. Specifically, in the context of Wikipedia, Albuquerque (2017) presents an information architecture framework for the development and management of controlled vocabularies in Specific objectives Methods O1.

(2022) introduce an evaluation method for taxonomies, including structural quality criteria such as generality, appropriateness-attainment and orthogonality, and provide generalized metrics for quantifying generality and appropriateness. In the domain of ontologies, da Costa et al. (2022) provide an updated review of software architectures, including ontology usage for managing large volumes of data. Wilson et al. (2022) outline a methodology for evaluating ontology quality that considers intrinsic and extrinsic aspects. Amith et al. (2018) offer insights into ontology evaluation within the field of biomedical KOS, which we adapt for evaluating Wikidata. Bolotnikova et al. (2011) propose practical methods for ontology evaluation, especially in automated contexts. Aghaebrahimian et al. (2022) explore the validity of Wikipedia categories for topic labeling, further contributing to the development of our evaluation criteria. The extrinsic criteria (Kless and Milton, 2010) assess the measurement of external qualities, their application and the domain, making reference to elements of the outcome as experienced by users. In contrast, quality indicators analyze aspects of structure and domain independently of their use in application contexts. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the efforts to unify the reviewed theories and the proposed methodology for ontology evaluation, see Table 2. 4.2 Proposed heuristic evaluation of taxonomies Heuristic evaluation, aiming to assess whether the taxonomy of Catalan Wikipedia, complies with the standards of sound knowledge organization not only concerning user experience but Evaluation criteria Extrinsic criteria Measurement of external qualities Analysis of external quality (structure) Application Context Design Efficiency Accessibility Availability Recoverability Understandability/Clarity Domain Adaptability Precision Relevance Full Functionality Timeliness/ Convenience Relevance or Currentness Volatility Credibility History Authority Intrinsic criteria Intrinsic domain features Vocabulary semantics Conciseness Architecture design Coverage External Consistency Comprehensibility Intrinsic structural qualities Syntax Regulatory compliance Hierarchy Complexity Architecture design Internal consistency Modularity Source(s): Table by authors Table 2. Methodological proposal for ontology evaluation JD 80,7 132 also formally within the realm of KOS. Based on the theoretical framework, a selection of indicators were selected that have been highlighted in our analysis and achievable with the access and technical resources available to us (see Table 3). When identifying and measuring these indicators, we have considered contributions from specialists and specific standards within the KOS sector, particularly taxonomies, to conduct an inspection analysis of Wikipedia’s category scheme. 4.3 Analysis of usage logs for the profession case study on gendered professions For the analysis of logs of the Catalan edition of Wikipedia we have used Pageviews Analysis (https://pageviews.wmcloud.org) which is a suite of eight tools designed for the examination of page views and unique device statistics on Wikimedia Foundation wikis. These tools, namely Pageviews, Langviews, Topviews, Siteviews, Massviews, Redirect Views, Userviews and Mediaviews, collectively form a comprehensive toolkit for data analysis. The foundation of these tools relies on data sourced from Wikimedia’s RESTBase API, which is structured in alignment with the definitions outlined in the Research: Page view and Research: Unique Devices documentation. Presently, this suite of tools is under the maintenance and stewardship of Community Tech. To address this analysis, we have chosen the field of professions, and based on state statistical data (INE: Instituto Nacional de Estad\u0001ıstica, 2024), we have selected the most masculinized (STEM) and feminized professions (nursing, library science and teaching) in Spain. 4.4 Heuristic assessment concerning structure and coverage It is essential to clarify that in Wikidata, property P21 encompasses both gender and sex. However, it is crucial to recognize that these two terms pertain to distinct aspects of human identity and biology. Sex is primarily associated with an individual’s physical and genetic characteristics and has historically been classified into two categories: male or female. In contrast, gender is a social and cultural construct that encompasses a broad spectrum of roles, behaviors, expectations and identities. It extends beyond a binary system, acknowledging that people can identify as male, female, both, neither, or a different gender altogether. It is imperative to comprehend the differentiation between sex and gender, as it is fundamental for fostering inclusivity and honoring the diverse experiences and identities of individuals (Garc\u0001ıa Dauder and P\u0001erez Sede~no, 2017). Apart from this feature of gender or sex of Wikidata, the members of the Ontology project have identified the limitations that make it not qualify as a proper ontology (Wikimedia, 2022). These limitations can be divided into two groups. The first group was initially identified in WikidataCon 2021, and they are aimed at overcoming barriers to the reuse of data by other services and projects. And the second group is considered to be issues existing in the knowledge representation in Wikidata. In the context of this study, we are primarily interested in the first group, as it identifies elements to overcome if it is to be applied in the categorization of Wikipedia content. Based on the barriers to reuse formulated by the project members, we present examples related to the classes that make up the range restriction of property P21 (gender or sex). The indicators have been selected considering their relevance and their suitability for the retrieval of gender-related articles; however, this can be extrapolated to other evaluator needs. 4.5 Performance of the Wikidata search system The data from Wikidata can be used for various purposes. Beyond the specific querying of an item or a set of items, Wikidata provides users with methods of data access for linking data without having to download it to another server, for enriching third-party data, or for Assessing knowledge organization systems 133 Indicator Reference Description Methodology Value Evaluability Al\u0004os-Moner et al.

In all cases, Wikidata’s data can be consumed by human users or by automated systems or bots (Wikimedia, 2023b). In one of the Wikidata guides, “Data Access” (Wikimedia, 2023a), eight methods for accessing Wikidata data are identified and described, three of which are oriented toward direct interaction with users who need to retrieve limited quantities of results (See Table 4). All methods of accessing Wikidata data operate on a foundation formed by the RDF data management system, or RDF repository, Blazegraph (Vrande\u0005ci\u0001c et al., 2023) (see Table 5). Undoubtedly, these figures are impressive and represent the largest open secondary database currently in existence. Nevertheless, in recent years, assessments of the degree of compliance with processes, accessibility and the use of search services have shown worrisome signs of stagnation. The Wikidata authorities are fully aware of these limitations and, in fact, have set their sights on the need to replace the underlying software of Wikidata, Blazegraph, with one that can better address the challenges of growth and quality.

Method for assessing the quality of the Wikidata ontology Assessing knowledge organization systems 135 And, regarding the ontology inconsistencies we mentioned earlier, the evaluation requirements established incorporate the use of more advanced integrity-checking languages than SPARQL functions. Specifically, the WDQS report refers to the Shapes Constraint Language, or SHACL. SHACL allows for graph validation and includes not only the ability to specify a severity level for validation results but also the possibility of providing suggestions on how to fix the data if a validation result occurs. The performance assessment of Wikidata follows the overarching evaluation framework introduced by Malyshev et al. (2018). The performance tests cover the period from 2015 to 2022, as specified by the SPARQL query service (Everett, 2015). 5. Results 5.1 Heuristic evaluation of SOK Wikipedia The heuristic evaluation of the Catalan Wikipedia category scheme has been carried out using the technique of standards inspection, in which a usability expert analyzes whether the interface follows the agreed-upon specifications and the standards defined on an international level. In the case at hand, a set of identified indicators has been generated, particularly based on normative sources. These sources also provide us with methods for obtaining evidence for each indicator, the applied metrics, and, when possible, optimal values. a) Evaluability The category schema of Wikipedia is valuable because category creators have various agreed-upon tools for their practice. We highlight the following: \u0002 Categorization guideline (Wikimedia, 2023d) resulting from the discussion and decision-making process specific to the encyclopedia \u0002 Help for category creators: Help:Category (Wikimedia, 2018) and the “Style Book on Categorization” section in the Categorization guideline (Wikimedia, 2023d) \u0002 Templates for category creators: Category:Maintenance templates for categories (Wikimedia, 2015) \u0002 There is a control over the pages that do not contain categories, for maintenance purposes. The level of knowledge about these tools has been informally assessed with some individual administrators of the Viquip\u0004edia community, and their lack of awareness regarding them has been conveyed. b) Reusability Access point Description Search (2023a) Search in contexts where we can use known entity designations or specify queries based on simple data relationships Linked Data Interface with URI The Linked Data Interface provides access to individual entities via URI: http:// www.wikidata.org/entity/Q??? For contexts where we need to retrieve individual and complete entities that we already know Wikidata query service (2023b) In contexts with a known data structure pattern of three components (subject, property, object), it offers two interfaces: one for SPARQL experts and one for assisted query generation Source(s): Table by authors Table 5. Approaches to accessing Wikidata JD 80,7 136 Each category has a unique instance and a single identifier, regardless of its various locations within the schema hierarchies. Wikipedia’s schema categories are available for database dumps in three data interchange formats: sql, json and xml. These formats do not provide semantic information about the concepts and relationships between the concepts in Wikipedia’s categorization schema, as the simple knowledge organization systems (SKOSs) data model could. Consequently, the possibilities for reusing Wikipedia categories in other datasets or information retrieval systems are greatly restricted. c) Stability The most notable stability-related metrics during the period 2004–2022 can be seen in Table 6. The annual growth rate remained high during the period 2004–2007, and from 2008 onwards, it experienced a significant decline until 2012. Starting from that year, the rate demonstrates a gradual reduction in the increase, and it stabilizes until 2020 when it experienced a very remarkable increase. This increase may be linked to one of the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic: greater availability of time for contributing to the Catalan edition of Wikipedia. The most abundant categories are in the fields of science and culture, followed by technology, humanities and events. The three areas with the fewest categories are biographies, information and places. d) Number of categories (concepts) As of December 31, 2022, Wikipedia’s category schema included 102,159 categories. We can compare this size with other similar KOSs that consist of pre-coordinated concepts and aim to represent encyclopedic knowledge. The List of Subject Headings of the National Catalan Library (LEMAC) contains 112,200 headings, considering both accepted and non-accepted ones. It originates from the translation of the Spanish version of the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH), which was preliminarily published by the Library Services of the Generalitat de Catalunya in 1988. Indicator Number Contributors Registered 565,000 Unregistered (different IPs) 1.6 million Active per month 46,000 Bots 359 1 Elements 101 million Properties 10,800 For external identifiers 7,800 Statements 1,440 million For external identifiers 206 million Average per item 14.3 Editions 1,800 million Per day 699,000 Monthly page views 12 months average 420 million Wikipedia articles using Wikidata (January 2023) 75–97% Wikipedia articles using Wikidata (caWiki) (January 2023) Including article infoboxes, self-categorization, descriptions, and maintenance work indicators 90.6% Note(s): 1Wikidata:Bots (2023b) Source(s): Table by authors Table 6. Blazegraph repository statistics (February, 2022) Assessing knowledge organization systems 137 Making growth rate comparisons between Wikipedia’s categorization schema and LEMAC is challenging. Wikipedia’s schema is relatively young, still in its first two decades of existence, while LEMAC has been in existence for 35 years, with an even longer history if we consider its origins. However, the following examples show clear indications of faster growth in Wikipedia’s categorization schema. In 2009, LEMAC experienced a growth of 2,663 new headings, whereas Wikipedia added 8,080 new categories. By 2021, LEMAC’s growth amounted to 1,219 new headings, while Wikipedia introduced a staggering 8,616 new categories. The magnitude of Wikipedia’s categories and its growth rate are not comparable to those of KOS applied to digital encyclopedias. The knowledge tree of the Gran Enciclop\u0004edia Catalana (GEC) comprises 425 categories, and the categories in the Encyclopedia Britannica total 123. In both cases, the hierarchy of the KOS is restricted to two levels. e) Number of semantic relationships We lack access to complete data on all hierarchical relationships between supercategories and subcategories. Still, we have a partial count covering the first three levels of the categorization schema, specifically involving main thematic categories and their second-level and third-level subcategories, resulting in 1,122 hierarchy relationships. f) Enrichment or granularity index In the first three levels of the category schema, there are 143 categories and 1,122 hierarchy relationships. The corresponding average enrichment index is 7.8461, significantly surpassing the optimal range, usually between 2 and 5. g) Degree of precoordination In the entirety of Wikipedia’s category schema, the average number of words that make up category labels is 3.6766, exceeding the maximum value typically recommended by experts, which is between 1.5 and 2 words. Other data indicating a deviation from this optimal value include the median number of words in category labels, which is three. However, there are exceptions, with some category labels having a maximum of 18 words, such as in the case of “Resolucions del Consell de Seguretat de les Nacions Unides sobre el Tribunal Penal Internacional per a l’antiga Iugosl\u0004avia\" (Resolutions of the United Nations Security Council on the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia). h) Number of levels in hierarchy or depth For the evaluation of this indicator, we reviewed all hierarchical chains within the main thematic category “Biographies.” In all cases, we found more than five levels. Consequently, this exceeds the maximum value recommended by experts. i) Number of categories in the same hierarchy level or breadth To assess this indicator, we examined the first two levels of subcategorization beyond the eight main thematic categories. In total, this section includes 144 categories, with 130 of them containing subcategories, while the remaining 14 link directly to Wikipedia pages. Among these 130 categories, there are 17 that have only one subcategory, constituting 13.07% of the assessed section, and in fact, this is the most common case. These instances violate the minimum requirement of two subcategories recommended by experts. Additionally, there are 35 categories with more than 12 subcategories, making up 26.92% of the evaluated section. These cases exceed the maximum of twelve subcategories suggested by experts. The highest breach of this limit occurs in the “Religion” category, which includes 43 subcategories. JD 80,7 138 When we sum up violations of both the minimum and maximum subcategory limits, we find that 40% of the assessed categories do not adhere to the optimal values of breadth (52 out of 130 categories). 5.2 Usage logs for the case study Wikipedia To provide a glimpse of Viquip\u0004edia usage (Catalan Wikipedia), the total number of viewed pages of the Catalan Wikipedia in one month is 49,338,638 and the number of unique devices accesses is 3,480,772 in September 2023 (Wikimedia, 2023c). And in this section, we present the data derived from our analysis of log entries for feminized professions (such as librarians, nurses and teachers), juxtaposed with STEM professions (see Table 7). The table encompasses two categories: “Feminized Professions” and “STEM Professions”. Each category is further broken down into specific professions, and the corresponding user visualizations statistics are presented. We examine access patterns beginning in June 2023, focusing on the Catalan edition of Wikipedia, and encompassing data from various devices. The table illustrates the engagement and activity levels across different professions within feminized or masculinized professions. The findings from the examination of feminized professions reveal that there is an average of 798 monthly accesses, with a mean of 2 editions monthly. And the outcomes obtained from the examination of STEM professions indicate that there is an average of 1,073 monthly accesses, with a mean of 0 editions monthly. 5.3 Heuristic evaluation of Wikidata These are the results of the heuristic evaluation of the ontologies of Wikidata. Examining Table 8 reveals significant challenges stemming from unproductive class hierarchies in navigation and search. Users are constrained from selecting multiple individuals of the same type within nodes, introducing complexity in search contexts. This limitation hampers quick decision-making, impacts reasoning by disrupting inference and consistency assessments and impedes automated interoperability in data cooperation. Ascending through upper chains in search contexts confuses users and complicates processes in both search and Indicator Value Minimum number of new categories.

Comparative analysis of log entries: feminized professions versus STEM professions Assessing knowledge organization systems 139 axiom-based reasoning. The inability to determine generality or specificity transfers the challenge to the search process, hindering statement validation and new knowledge inference. Overall, unproductive class hierarchies present intricate obstacles across various facets of ontology usage. 5.4 Performance Wikidata An in-depth assessment of Wikidata’s performance from 2015 to 2022 is presented in Table 9, utilizing the framework established by Malyshev et al. (2018). Table 9 furnishes a comprehensive evaluation of query performance within the Wikidata platform through several key metrics. Under the section denoted as “Query Metrics,” distinct trends come to the forefront. Notably, a substantial count of “Good Queries” signifies operations executed with success, contributing significantly to the platform’s operational prowess. Conversely, a noteworthy number of “Bad Queries” denotes instances where queries faced issues or failed to deliver intended results, thereby illuminating potential areas for refinement. Moreover, the metric detailing the “Total Query Execution Time” offers a panoramic view of Wikidata’s efficiency, encapsulating the cumulative time required for executing the entire array of queries. This temporal dimension serves as a pivotal indicator of the platform’s responsiveness. In tandem, the metric revealing the “Total Result Rows” speaks volumes about the sheer magnitude of information generated across the spectrum of queries conducted on Wikidata. This voluminous outcome underscores the platform’s extensive capacity in producing relevant and diverse information. 6. Discussion In 2017, the Wikimedia Movement adopted a new strategic plan for 2030, which establishes the goal of “providing knowledge as a service” (becoming a platform that offers open knowledge to the world through interfaces and communities), with a focus on “knowledge equity” (directing our efforts toward knowledge and communities that have been marginalized by power structures and privileges .. . Breaking social, political and technical barriers that hinder people from accessing and contributing to free knowledge). This collaborative strategic document places two core principles at its recommendations: inclusivity and a people-centered approach (understood as attending to people’s needs). It sets the goal for 2030 as closing the gender gap andfocusing onthe inclusionofunderrepresentedgroups. The knowledge organization proposal presented in this paper is fully aligned with the new strategic direction. To increase the visibility and access to the knowledge of Wikipedia, particularly that related to and about marginalized gender groups (women, nonbinary individuals, intersex, trans men and trans women), a dual solution is proposed. On the one hand, a technical solution involving the use of Wikidata ontologies as a KOS to facilitate information search and retrieval in Wikipedia, without increasing biases existing in reality. Wikidata has shown to be more aligned with the gender perspective than Wikipedia, as demonstrated in in-depth studies (Zhang and Terveen, 2021). On the other hand, a social, Query metrics Values Good queries 5,242,253 Bad queries 157,791 Total query execution time 651,976 Total result rows 7.56 Bil Source(s): Table by authors Table 9. Wikidata performance assessment JD 80,7 140 cultural and political solution that involves working with the Wikipedia community to accept internationally recognized standards in the field of knowledge organization and embracing two principles considered strategic by the Wikipedia movement: inclusivity to avoid the discrimination of marginalized groups and, above all, the principle of people-centered service with a special focus on their informational needs. With the technical solution, by opting for Wikidata ontologies as the KOS for Wikipedia’s content, alignment with international standards of knowledge organization would be achieved, and it would empower Wikipedia users (readers and editors) to search for and retrieve encyclopedia content according to their needs. Empowerment would occur during the search and navigation process, as users would decide on search elements closer to their needs, unlike the current categories, which are proposed based on the worldview of those who created, classified and indexed them, without allowing the combination of search elements. Delving into the details of the proposal in this academic paper, it advocates the use of ontologies as a KOS and opts for Wikidata because its original purpose is to store data (properties and relationships) from content present in Wikipedia articles in any language. If taken to its fullest potential, Wikidata could become the KOS for Wikipedia. In this sense, some current Wikipedia categories are already directly constructed from Wikidata (“living people”). Wikipedia already has different sections linked to Wikidata, acting as a KOS through common examples like InfoBoxes or authority records. In the evaluation carried out by experts and the heuristics, most assessments of Wikipedia’s analysis variables are low. In contrast, for Wikidata, there is room for improvement, and the Wikidata community has already identified these and included them in the agenda for improvement and tool development to address these issues. Two interesting contributions are the entity schema and the backend, which bring substantial benefits to the ontology, such as aspects related to the organization of data related to sex or gender. This demonstrates the potential for improvement. It is also important to recognize the need to revise the name of the “sex or gender” property, which mixes biological characteristics with individual definition and social construction in its label. In the case of Wikidata, decision-making processes for improvements are made within a smaller community with a more respectful perspective of accepted and recognized international standards in the field of knowledge organization. In contrast, in the case of Wikipedia, the gender bias existing in society is exacerbated by opposing positions on gender diversity expressed with strong ideological arguments. At the same time, opting for Wikidata ontologies as the KOS for Wikipedia’s content would empower users (readers or editors) to meet their informational needs. We agree that Wikipedia’s categorization system (category schemes) is easy for users to understand and closely aligned with their vocabulary and natural language. However, it also has disadvantages, as discussed in this proposal, related to cultural, social or political biases and imbalances that any controlled vocabulary entails. On the other hand, category schemes, are pre-coordinated thesauri that combine concepts, classes, or terms from a controlled vocabulary at the time of their construction or indexing. This means that there could be a category like “Catalan doctors from the south” created by the Wikipedia community, and a person from anywhere in the world should be able to understand (deduce) that it may include “female doctors living in the southern part of Catalonia.” In contrast, the use of ontologies to organize knowledge would provide a better representation of Wikidata’s content because each property represents a single dimension (attribute) of an entity or a set of entities. It is the user who, at the time of the search, combines the attributes that best respond to their need to retrieve the relevant entity or entities. Currently, a Wikipedia category like “Catalan doctors from the south” links two different dimensions of a person: their profession and their origin. However, in an ontology, one could choose which elements to combine (profession, year of birth, place of residence or any other) independently and in combination with Boolean operators, so that the search would align much more with the Assessing knowledge organization systems 141 user’s information needs (human or machine). The KOS proposed by Wikidata is post- coordinated, empowering users through the system by allowing them to combine predefined attributes. Therefore, Wikidata is the ontology that could bring organization and a better representation of what is known in Wikipedia. In fact, Wikipedia already generates categories that arise from Wikidata, such as “living people.” The Wikidata ontology can be a solution for applying a gender perspective and overcoming the lack of scientific-technical foundation. However, the need for a cultural change within the community, which should accept the process of substitution to align with international technology consensus and promote more equitable access to content diversity, cannot be ignored. 7. Conclusions This study has delved into the complex issue of gender bias within Wikipedia’s KOS, specifically within its taxonomy categories. By synthesizing the theoretical framework, an extensive review of academic literature, and a detailed analysis of Wikipedia’s content structure, we have arrived at the following comprehensive conclusions. Throughout our research, it has become abundantly clear that gender bias persists within Wikipedia, as attested by a consistent body of academic literature. This bias is not confined to the content itself but also extends to the limited diversity among volunteer contributors across various languages. Our own analysis further reinforces this finding, substantiating the existence of gender bias within Wikipedia’s content organization system. One notable revelation is that Wikipedia’s encyclopedic nature tends to prioritize the perspectives of content indexers and categorizers over the needs of its users. Consequently, the categories within Wikipedia have often been designed to facilitate the work of editors, collecting pages under specific concepts, while falling short in terms of enabling effective information retrieval and meeting user information needs. Furthermore, we have identified that Wikipedia’s system of categories (KOS) frequently falls short of established quality standards. For instance, hierarchy depth often exceeds the recommended maximum of 12 levels, and the breadth, indicated by the number of subcategories within a category, deviates from the recommended range of 2–5 subcategories. From the perspective of gender and intersectional analysis, it becomes evident that there is no objective basis for excluding gender identities, such as “women” or “non-binary individuals,” as categorization criteria on Wikipedia. This finding highlights the presence of inconsistencies, such as the use of female-gendered first-level categories (“midwives” or “bearded women”), which persist within the platform. Our study concludes by asserting that Wikipedia’s categories hold significant potential for improvement, not only in addressing issues related to gender identity but also in enhancing the overall KOS for more effective user information retrieval. This recommendation stems from the observation that the vast majority of Wikipedias, with a few exceptions like the Catalan and Italian versions, have seamlessly incorporated gender identity categories into their organizational systems, thereby aiding content search and retrieval for users. In light of these conclusions, we strongly recommend a comprehensive reevaluation of Wikipedia’s content organization system. This reevaluation should focus on inclusivity, equity and the fulfillment of users’ information needs. Acknowledging the potential for the integration of gender identity as a valid classification criterion, Wikipedia can make substantial strides toward aligning its knowledge organization practices with contemporary principles of information access and inclusion. Shifting our attention to the analysis of Wikidata, our investigation has focused on the technological aspects involved in the organization and retrieval of gender-diverse content within this platform. From this examination, several key conclusions have emerged. JD 80,7 142 First, our analysis has revealed that Wikidata exhibits a commendable level of sensitivity toward gender diversity, notably seen in the inclusion of a variety of gender categories under the P21 property. Second, we recommend that Wikidata makes a clear distinction between properties related to biological sex and properties tied to gender identity, as the existing disjunctive labeling of the P21 property conflates these two distinct concepts. Third, in contrast to Wikipedia, which often grapples with socio-cultural influences in decision-making processes, our analysis shows that Wikidata effectively mirrors real-world gender diversity without exacerbating existing biases as evidences by the research conducted by authors such as Zhang and Terveen (2021). The findings presented in this paper illustrate that Wikidata offers a richer array of tools to represent the diversity of gender identities. Fourth, the Wikidata community tends to emphasize technical and data-centric arguments in its decision-making processes, diverging from Wikipedia’s debates that often involve socio-cultural considerations, particularly regarding gender categories. Lastly, the linguistic diversity of Wikidata poses unique challenges, particularly in languages where gender differentiation is significant. The debate over gender-neutral labelling in languages like Catalan underscores the importance of linguistic and cultural sensitivity in maintaining the dataset. In conclusion, this analysis has predominantly delved into the technological aspects of enhancing the representation of gender diversity within Wikidata. However, it is imperative to recognize that a comprehensive solution necessitates a harmonious blend of technological enhancements and cultural considerations in the decision-making processes governing the organization of content in this vital knowledge-sharing platform. This convergence of technology and culture is paramount in fostering inclusivity and equity in the representation of gender diversity in the digital realm.
