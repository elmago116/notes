How do PhD students discover the resources and relationships con- ducive to satisfaction and success in their degree programs? This study proposes a community-grounded, extensible knowledge graph to make explicit and tacit information intuitively discoverable, by capturing and visualizing relationships between people based on their activities and relations to information resources in a particular domain. Students in an interdisciplinary PhD program were engaged through three workshops to provide insights into the dynamics of interactions with others and relevant data categories to be included in the graph data model. Based on these insights we propose a model, serving as a testbed for exploring multiplex graph visualizations and a potential basis of the information system to facilitate information discovery and decision-making. We discovered that some of the tacit knowledge can be explicitly encoded, while the rest of it must stay within the community. The graph-based visualization of the social and knowledge networks can serve as a pointer toward the people having the relevant information, one can reach out to, online or in person.

A signiﬁcant percentage of PhD students are experiencing at least two psychological symptoms and have sought help for anxiety or depression related to their studies [1, 2]. One key factor inﬂuencing the overall experience of PhD students during their course of study is the so-called departmental culture, encompassing “student/faculty relationships, student involvement in academic life, student satisfaction with programs, student-to-student interactions, institutional ﬁnancial assistance to students, and dissertation factors” [3]. The issue of navigating departmental cultures becomes even more problematic in interdisciplinary PhD programs, where students reported “feeling disconnected from faculty and peers, having to span boundaries between areas, departments, and knowledge bases” [4]. In this study, we describe the participative development of a knowledge base to support interdisciplinary PhD students to visualize and navigate multiple departmental cultures. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023 I.

Gazan Science can be described as a “complex, self-organizing, and evolving network of scholars, projects, papers and ideas” [5]. As Börner [6] noted, researchers and authors can be perceived as nodes in networks of support and inﬂuence, while their selection of research topics, collaborators, students, and publication venues inﬂuence and shape their place in these networks. In these ‘knowledge networks,’ actors serve both as keepers of knowledge and as agents that seek out, communicate, and create knowledge [7, 8]. However, information is often not equally available to all actors [4], and the opportunities for “social” information sharing [9] diminished due to the pandemic. Consequently, we chose a multilayer/multiplex network as the medium to address the raised issues and create a knowledge graph combining information on social and knowledge traces in a community. The aim of building this graph is to facilitate explicit and tacit information discovery and informed decision-making related to the factors identiﬁed as meaningful for this population: i) establishing collaboration with faculty [3, 4, 10], ii) information and resources available about research topic of interest [3, 7, 11], and iii) interaction with peers, including community building [3, 4]; while creating a testbed for exploring multiplex network visualization and navigation options [12]. The setting for this case study is the Interdisciplinary PhD Program in Commu- nication and Information Sciences (CIS), at the University of Hawai‘i at M¯anoa. Stu- dents—especially those new to the program who have not been exposed to informal information ﬂows—are considered the main user population of this information discov- ery system. Following the activity theoretical approach and requirements/milestones for the program, students were engaged in every step of the knowledge graph modeling process. As noted by Hogan et al. [13], the deﬁnition of a knowledge graph remains con- tentious, but in short, it can be described as “a graph of data intended to accumulate and convey knowledge of the real world, whose nodes represent entities of interest and whose edges represent relations between these entities”. Before building the graph, we created the database model to support tacit knowledge exchange-such as ﬁrst-hand impressions of other students-that have been shown to be of crucial importance for this population [7, 9, 10]. Getting procedural advice or hearing other students’ experiences with faculty, classes, and exams usually happens in a serendipitous way, via in-person conversations, but these opportunities for informal information exchange were severely disrupted by COVID-19. Therefore, we propose this data-driven discovery tool that combines topical research representations and tacit interpersonal relations data to identify and support impactful interdisciplinary collaborations [5] and multiple departmental cultures [7] common to iSchools. The main contribution of this paper is the graph database model developed and presented alongside user-derived needs. We outline some of the data categories and relationships between them (including reﬁning attributes) that can be used to encode both explicit and tacit knowledge, while the affordance of network visualization supports the discovery of people with pertinent information that is not encoded in the knowledge graph. Community Design of a Knowledge Graph 475 2 Related Work The aim of this section is to connect the present study to previous research streams relevant to the challenges of tacit knowledge transfer, representing and supporting inter- disciplinary collaborations, and to summarize and justify the affordances of a knowledge graph approach. 2.1 Tacit Knowledge Exchange for PhD Students Personal networks and peer communities present a vital information source for doctoral students [3, 7]. So-called “insider” knowledge is something perceived as necessary for the success of interdisciplinary PhD students but is available only to students and pro- fessors who have been involved in the program for a certain amount of time [4, 7]. This knowledge is often referred to as experiential or tacit knowledge, here operationalized as the values and quality of the resource of interest, as perceived by students [14]. Resources that help students discover appropriate faculty to collaborate with are especially critical for this population [3, 4, 10], as well as information about research topics of interest [3, 7, 11]. Visualizing social networks of people in a shared academic setting could support “so- cial” sharing [9] by providing a better picture of the common links, potentially democra- tizing access to useful information currently available only to those conveniently located in the social network. 2.2 User Needs for iSchools and Interdisciplinary PhD Programs The need for a community portal to support students from diverse disciplines has been identiﬁed in previous studies as a potentially useful forum for peer information exchange [15], but it remains an elusive goal. The challenge multiplies when interdisciplinary PhD students must select appropriate faculty advisors from a rich pool of multi-disciplinary researchers, which has been a longstanding success factor in PhD student persistence [3, 16]. Choi focuses on the importance of identity formation within iSchools, where students can question dominant research trends, locate their own interests and develop their own research identity [17]. Wiggins and Sawyer propose an analysis of interdisciplinary faculty research output to outline the landscape within which iSchool students might locate their work [18]. Each of these studies distinguishes between research and community relationships but tends to focus on research topics as the basis for connection rather than social relationships. We propose a lightweight, extensible visualization, driven by student focus groups, to capture and represent community interactions and tacit information alongside research connections, so students can view paths and interactions of those who have come before. 2.3 Network-Based Representation and Discovery Faculty proﬁle pages can be a lightweight data source of potential connections between researchers and students from diverse ﬁelds, and community stakeholders [19], and can 476 S. Gardasevic and R. Gazan provide a way to identify one’s place in the interdisciplinary community. However, in the case of the program studied here, students reported that faculty proﬁles are often not up to date, and too numerous to inspect thoroughly [10]. Also, expert ﬁnding applica- tions in the scholarly domain are usually based on recommending acclaimed researchers based on their publication history (i.e. [20, 21]). These attempts have traditionally been based on the networks generated from publication data obtained from a single database such as Computer Science Bibliography – DBLP [21–23], Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed [24]. However, this research, based on a convenience sample, is often addressing only a limited number of relationships, usually pertaining to co-authorship and shared research topics. Our approach aggregates different web resources (including multiple sources indicating researchers’ expertise) in a single knowledge graph-since research has shown that the graph-based interface is more practical for ﬁnding speciﬁc information and simple question-answering tasks, compared to hierarchically organized information [25]. Furthermore, we expand the scope of relationships to represent the interdisci- plinary domain, as three dimensions are considered as a minimum to understand the full complexity of social structures [26]. We model interdisciplinary PhD program information as a multiplex network, deﬁned as “networks where the same set of nodes is represented in every layer, although the interaction between nodes might be different in each one. As an example, two nodes might be connected in one layer and might not in other” [27]. Analyzing and visualizing multiplex graphs are considered complex problems, as each additional relation makes the choice of an appropriate layout more challenging, even incomprehensible, as soon as it contains a few dozen nodes [28]. One previous attempt to visualize scholarly domain multiplex networks included a dataset of 61 nodes connected over ﬁve layers (work, leisure, coauthor, lunch, and Facebook) [28]. Unlike in this exploratory approach, we are grounding the graph in user needs, answering the necessity to re-frame user needs and data as multilayered networks problems, providing visualization researchers more exposure to the application domain [12]. 3 Case Introduction The CIS PhD Program was established in 1986 and has approximately 30 current students and over 100 alumni. The program is a voluntary and collaborative effort of over 40 faculty from four units housed in three colleges (as of Fall 2022): • Communications (COM) (College of Social Sciences) • Library and Information Science (LIS) (College of Social Sciences) • Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) (College of Natural Sciences) • Information Technology Management (ITM) (Shidler College of Business). While the ﬂexible, decentralized structure of the program provides more possible research avenues for PhD students, it also requires students to ﬁnd and navigate their own path through program requirements [4, 10]. This is especially acute since the selection of a dissertation chair and other faculty mentors is the crucial factor contributing to PhD student retention and satisfaction in general [3, 31]. In addition, CIS students and Community Design of a Knowledge Graph 477 alumni also serve as valuable information resources, sharing their ﬁrsthand experiences and wisdom regarding potential faculty collaborators and the practical mechanics of how to meet program requirements. However, an increasing number of students are not physically present at the university (so-called “off-island” students) and participate in joint activities such as the required weekly interdisciplinary seminar online via Zoom. This part of the population does not have the same opportunity to be part of informal interactions and information ﬂows and gain so-called “insider” knowledge contributing to the success of interdisciplinary PhD students [4], further justifying the need for the remotely accessible technology presented here. These concerns are even more urgent considering the COVID-19 pandemic when all coursework moved online, and at this writing, the two most recent cohorts of students have yet to meet their peers or faculty in person. Ofﬁcial CIS program milestones and requirements are inscribed in a Policies and Procedures document1, which formed the basis for developing research instruments, as well as for creating the ﬁrst iteration of the graph database model, later modiﬁed based on CIS student input from the workshops. The research presented in this paper is the second stage of a larger project. The results of the ﬁrst stage suggested that information resources and relevant data categories can be formalized and encoded in a form of a knowledge graph and suggested a path to capture/obtain tacit information. The present study builds on the ﬁrst, and explores the research question: What tacit knowledge can be represented and discovered through a knowl- edge graph, and what can be only indicated? The ﬁnal stage of this project will involve the same population in the participatory design of visualizations and seamless visual analytical approach of the multiplex graph, to examine if this artifact has utility compared to current means of information discovery, and if it is worthwhile to develop it further into an information system. 4Method Following a Human-Centered Design approach, upon the requirements gathering process that consisted of interviews and a website usability study engaging program students and alumni [10], we conducted three workshops over two years and developed the database model shown in Fig. 1. Students helped identify relevant people, roles, resources, actions, experiences, and relationships, and these were iteratively integrated into the database model, shared back in successive workshops and reﬁned based on feedback. Including the community in the design of a technology to support their interactions helps reveal and unravel the underlying values of both the proposed system and the PhD program itself [29], creating a rationale and platform for further cooperation and community building. 1 CIS Program policies and procedures- https://bit.ly/cis_policy_procedures. 478 S. Gardasevic and R. Gazan 4.1 Positionality and Limitations Both authors are insiders to the CIS program, with different roles and perspectives, and with access to different kinds of knowledge about the community, which we feel provides a productive tension. The ﬁrst author is a CIS PhD candidate and must balance her own experience with those of other students with whom she is engaging in this study, including informal daily interactions. The limitation imposed by this position as a student is that graph design decisions and interpretations may be biased by personal experience. We have attempted to balance this threat to internal validity by including member checks as validation points to incorporate multiple students’ perspectives. The second author is a faculty member and former CIS Chair who teaches one of the three core courses and serves on multiple dissertation, exam, and other program committees. His perspective yields different stories about enablers, barriers, and metrics of student experience and degree progress. This limitation is that students could be understandably hesitant to share their unﬁltered observations with someone in a position to evaluate them, due to courtesy bias or other factors. We address this limitation by emphasizing the anonymization component of the data analysis process and creating faculty-free workshops and spaces for data collection. 4.2 Data Collection This research is framed by activity theory, as this approach has been used to inform the ways in which interactive tools should be designed to make a positive impact on human activities [30]. In this case, the overarching goal (activity) of a student is to obtain a PhD degree; to get there, students are motivated to fulﬁll written program requirements (actions), such as taking certain courses and exams, but also unwritten requirements such as developing and successfully navigating relationships with faculty and peers. Each step in the research design was informed by activity theory, encompassing formal program requirements and other practical and less tangible aspects of the interdisciplinary PhD student experience to help guide future students. In the three workshops, current CIS students shared their experiences in a forum envi- ronment and reacted to the evolving graph design. Student participation was voluntary, and data was collected without faculty present and analyzed with full conﬁdentiality and anonymity. For that reason, only the ﬁrst author facilitated workshops and anonymized the raw data, then shared it with the second author in a form that honors the privacy of the participants. All workshops used a visual representation of a graph database model in a then-current version, to communicate the data modeling efforts thus far, to serve as a community member check on the “ontology” of the shared domain, and to identify areas for improvement. The three workshops took place from December 2019 to April 2022. The ﬁrst included both face-to-face and online participants, while the other two were fully online via Zoom, and included 18, 15, and 10 students, respectively. The workshops were recorded, transcribed and anonymized by the ﬁrst author, while the rest of the data was captured as text ﬁles created by the participants’ chat, and Google documents where students were invited to leave anonymous comments on the topics discussed. Community Design of a Knowledge Graph 479 During the ﬁrst workshop, participants completed a questionnaire2 designed to val- idate the ﬁndings from the previous study stage, while the poll results were used as a prompt for discussion during the workshop. The aim of the second workshop was to gather feedback on the draft data collection form, designed with the intention to populate parts of the graph with students’ personal information, based on data categories they perceived as relevant. The intent was to hone the questions and structure of the form to get the most useful information when collecting data in the future, negotiate data privacy boundaries, and get feedback and further recommendations on what data would be most relevant for this population. This workshop resulted in an elaborate data collection form3 created in Qualtrics that was used to collect the data from the students to populate the graph. This form was designed for collecting user-generated information via pre-determined categories, as well as the free text inputs, while all the data collected corresponds with the graph model. The third workshop invited open discussion on the students’ experiences, where participants were distributed in breakout rooms depending on i) program progress stage and ii) preferred methodological approach4, to discuss and exchange information about what helped and hampered their progress. 4.3 Data Analysis The data consist of anonymized i) transcription of workshops, ii) Google documents, iii) researcher notes, and iv) pertinent questionnaire/form inputs. The data analysis was conducted iteratively. After each workshop, both authors conducted the ﬁrst cycle of descriptive coding of student responses, and the categories that emerged in all three work- shops were pertinent to ‘ﬂow of information in the community’, ‘lack of opportunities for in-person contact with peers’, and ‘obtaining information on program requirements’. Upon the discussion about results from this phase, researchers created the utility-driven set of codes, to conduct the structural data coding [31] with the previously elicited and potential new concepts that could be represented via a graph model. Upon the second round of coding, we discussed revisions to the data model based on the data analysis insights as we outline in several examples below. To perform the participant’ checks, each workshop started with an overview of the graph model in its current state, to gather further feedback and reﬂect on the accuracy of data representation for their information needs. Participatory research relies on participant engagement with the data collection and coding processes, which helps create a sense of ownership of the data reﬂecting their community, a “safe space” where subjects can interact and reﬂect, and an understanding of how their actions and interactions are represented within the graph [32]. 2 Questionnaire with results- https://bit.ly/cis_worskhop_1. 3 Data collection form - https://bit.ly/student_data_collection_cis. 4 Breakout room prompts for Workshop 3 https://bit.ly/cis_workshop_3. 480 S. Gardasevic and R. Gazan 5 Results: User-Driven Graph Modeling Decisions In this section, we discuss the themes that emerged as important for the community during the workshops, and how they inﬂuenced the graph modeling and design decisions. In Fig. 1, we presented the CIS domain graph database model in its current iteration and the nodes and relationships between them. The model or its parts can be adapted and reused in other interdisciplinary environments. Since we use the Neo4J graph database for building this knowledge graph, we utilize the native Cypher language syntax when referring to speciﬁc parts of the model, i.e.: (Node)—[RELATIONSHIP]—> (Node); in this case, (Node) represents a class/category in the model, and not pertinent instances. Fig. 1. CIS graph database model (Color ﬁgure online) Considering our aim to facilitate the active exchange of tacit information, (Person) occupies the central place in the model and is connected to most of the surrounding 12 nodes/classes, presented through 4 color-coded groupings. Those nodes present the afﬁliations (layers) via which the actors in this multiplex network may be connected. The data comprising the graph was gathered from different web locations, normalized and ingested into the Neo4J, and is available for download and reuse5, while the student- generated data is not included in this dataset. The graph created according to this model 5 The data ‘dump’ of CIS Neo4J database-https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.ﬁgshare.21663401.v2. Community Design of a Knowledge Graph 481 represents a picture of a domain, as it is captured in Spring 2022, while the publications in the corpus represent the sample of publishing activity of faculty in the last 10 years. We acknowledge the challenge of maintaining updated data, but we offer this model as a useful snapshot to elicit student reaction and engagement. Following the activity theory approach, the categories that were initially included by default in the graph were the CIS degree requirements that every student must fulﬁll to advance to ABD (all but dissertation) status. Those categories are (Course), (Exam), (Dissertation), and (Publication). 5.1 (Person) Node and Its Attributes (Fig. 1, Central Orange Node) The (Person) node, naturally, has the most attributes, as it is designed to capture informa- tion primarily about other students and outline some interesting, relevant, or potentially shared interests and experiences. There are three subsections of attributes; Academic Record attributes representing information such as cohort_year, indicating the strength of ties with others that share the same value attribute since participants stated that taking classes together with cohort peers makes them closer, as they can talk about challenges and struggles (noted as pre- COVID practice). In the Afﬁliation Information subsection, we capture the CIS afﬁliation, with a Boolean value, to distinguish CIS-afﬁliated people from others (such as co-authors or faculty that left the university). The Personal Information section contains categories that capture free-text information that may serve as potential connection points, such as shared hobbies or neighborhoods. This was intended to support community-building, since students reported feeling lonely, especially those at the dissertation research and writing stage and due to pandemic isolation [4, 10]. Another attribute that evolved based on participant suggestions was caregiver_of . Initially, the category was named family_status, where students could share data such as the ages of their minor children, to potentially connect for play dates. Participants broadened our conception of this category to include other senses of caregiving, which also provided deeper insights into the range of students’ life situations: For the number of ‘minor children’...some of us have adult children. Also consider changing this to ‘are you a caregiver’ as some need to care for elderly parents, etc. 5.2 (Dissertation), (Methodology), (Tool) Nodes (Fig. 1, Top Three Green Nodes) As mentioned, (Dissertation) is crucial for this population, therefore separated from the (Research) as a category and forms the basis of one of the most important networks—the dissertation mentorship network. In this program, there are over 40 faculty members from which students can choose i) a dissertation chair, ii) three dissertation committee members (at least two of which must be afﬁliated with different units (Department) to help ensure an interdisciplinary research approach), and iii) an “external” member, which further increases the disciplinary range of potential collaborators. Based on the inputs from participants, asking to see what fac- ulty served as “external” members in previous committees, we modeled the relationship 482 S. Gardasevic and R. Gazan by adding the role of faculty involved in the previous dissertations. Upon applying social network analysis and centrality metric, visualizing this network can quickly show the most active dissertation chairs and committee members; seeing their previous collabora- tions might help students decide who to invite to serve on their committee. In Fig. 2 we demonstrate a perspective of the dissertation mentorship network, where faculty node colors represent their departmental afﬁliations (LIS-purple, COM-orange, ITM-yellow, ICS-blue); green nodes are dissertations; while the number of dissertation engagements is shown in node size, and dissertation chairing via red edges. Fig. 2. Dissertation-mentorship network showing collaboration between faculty from different departments. (Color ﬁgure online) Considering the importance of the relationship with the supervisor for the overall PhD experience [3, 31], one workshop participant wrote succinctly and directly about the information they seek from other students: I would ask them-is your supervisor a good mentor? This statement demonstrates that some of the most-sought information is not easily encodable, but the graph supports the option to indicate a person that can share it with you, directly. The (Methodology) node reﬂects the program requirement of taking a research meth- ods course, and the common but informal practice of including a methodology expert in the dissertation committee. With the information encoded this way, students can get i) a quick overview of faculty who use a certain methodological approach in their research (Fig. 3); and ii) discover appropriate methodology classes based on the comments of other CIS students-a requirement expressed during the ﬁrst workshop. The (Methodology) node relates to the (Tool) node, as students are interested in ﬁnding out methodology classes that use particular tools. This information was lacking Community Design of a Knowledge Graph 483 from the current information space and was indicated by study participants at the third workshop as much needed. Students who populated the data collection form indicated tools they used in classes they attended. Furthermore, the graph also contains data on the people who used a tool to perform research, so a student can identify and directly consult that person on the issue. 5.3 (Course), (Department), (Exam) Nodes (Fig. 1, Left Three Blue Nodes) On the left side of the model, we formalized the departmental afﬁliation of people, and the attribute named role is intended to capture data that would help distinguish/ﬁlter actors based on their afﬁliation to different departments (“Student”, “Professor”, “Alum- ni”, “TA”, etc.). This modeling decision helps students see the interdepartmental col- laborations (interdisciplinarity indicator), and current students’ graduate assistantship afﬁliations (insider knowledge indicator). When it comes to encoding tacit knowledge, some community members were under- standably hesitant to leave written traces of their experience with a professor, as opposed to their experience regarding courses and exams taken. During the ﬁrst workshop, more students expressed support for the latter, both via the questionnaire and discussion. A comment illustrating this point is: Social rating is toxic. As a result, we included the space for reﬂection as an attribute of the relationship (Person)—[HAS_TAKEN]—>(Course/Exam), where students can note their experi- ences if they feel they should share them with their peers, allowing for tacit knowledge encoding and sharing. This way, students can comment on professors if they wish, albeit indirectly. To manage the privacy settings, upon discussion with students, we allowed three options of the public for the reﬂection attribute value: “public,” “CIS students”, and “private”. For those who indicated their observations as “private”, we anonymized the data by connecting it to an Anonymous person instance-so the comments are still available to other CIS students, without clear implications of who might have left them. Via graph visualization, students will be able to see others who took a course/exam of their interest and reach out to them for a private discussion, if sufﬁcient reﬂection input is missing. Some of the reﬂections left by students for courses are: This class was meant to prepare us for [a qualifying] exam, but it did not. Way too much reading. I enjoyed this class, it helped me write dissertation proposal- without this class I wouldn’t be able to write it that fast. It gives you the basic structure and what you can expect from the journey. And I liked the professor- she’s very encouraging and inspirational. 484 S. Gardasevic and R. Gazan 5.4 (Research Topic), (Research Area), (Domain of Application) Nodes (Fig. 1, Right Three Yellow Nodes) Considering the case of an interdisciplinary PhD program, facilitating communication across disciplines [33] is a core aim of this work. The three yellow nodes on the right side of the model, namely (Research Topic), (Research Area), and (Domain of Application) are intended to host vocabularies that will serve as boundary objects, which “inhabit several communities of practice and satisfy the informational requirements of each of them” [34]. With these concepts in mind, we have chosen controlled vocabularies for pertinent nodes that would be understandable across the four constituent disciplinary areas of CIS. This contribution helps bridge gaps in cross-disciplinary understanding among diverse units that have been identiﬁed in prior studies (e.g. [35, 36]). As one of the participants stated: The program’s strength — the cross-discipline nature — is also its weakness. It would be interesting to ﬁnd the “e Pluribus Unum” that makes the “one from the many,” some set of unifying principles to rally around. Our approach was to involve people educated in the different disciplines encom- passed by the program, to serve as translators or mediators, and create vocabularies to improve cross-disciplinary communication [33]. In the ﬁrst version of the modeling effort, Discipline was not included as a separate node in the graph, since it was potentially repetitive with the (Department), and we did not wish to reify disciplinary divisions. However, the workshops again yielded valuable insights from community members, and we introduced a (Research Area) as a node in response to comments in line with: I think because there is interdisciplinarity, people tend to gravitate to others who are doing a similar type of research. Research Area is a loosely deﬁned term, often used to refer to discipline-like structures, yet targeting smaller units that often span disciplinary borders [37]. This term is used throughout the CIS website to describe areas of focus, such as Human- Computer Interaction, Data Science, and Health Informatics, providing a warrant from the community to include the term and node in the model. We operationalize Research Topic entries as uncontrolled, free-response words and phrases that allow students and researchers to describe their research interests in their own words. Finally, we operationalize the Domain of Application as the particular setting, technology, and/or community with which their research engages. For the sake of the readability of the model, links from other nodes were omitted but are originating from (Publication), (Dissertation), (Research), (Lab), and (Course) instances. The controlled vocabularies were used to manually index (Publication) and (Dissertation) instances and are subsets of the Australian and New Zealand Stan- dard Research Classiﬁcation (ANZSRC). Pertinent classiﬁcation systems were com- plemented by domain-speciﬁc inputs. The same corpus was automatically indexed by Computer Science Ontology [38]. Community Design of a Knowledge Graph 485 Students consider information about the research nuances of CIS faculty particularly valuable, and a participant in the third workshop expressed their issue as follows: I talked to [CIS chair] and I was like, who else studies [Topic X]? And l they were like “Oh, well you just have to go through everyone’s CV.” And I’m like, “I don’t have time to go through how many different CVs to ﬁnd out potentially someone who might be able to help me!” And maybe it’s just because I’m intro- verted too. But I don’t know how to start those conversations with professors like, “What do you study? Can you help me?” Indexing the work of faculty and students with familiar terms would allow not only for quick discovery of potential collaborators, but also provide potential inputs for con- versation starters for students to approach faculty, as they reported a lack of opportunities to communicate with them. While the boundary object nodes may appear to be similar categories with sub- tle distinctions, within this interdisciplinary environment researchers often have the same Domain of Application, but different lenses for conceptualizing and studying it. For example, “Cybersecurity” might encompass various disciplinary topics such as algorithms, system architecture, policy, or ethics. Potentially, these nodes could be entry points to which graphs from other departments and programs could be “attached”, to help identify shared topics of interest across the university system. 5.5 (Research), (Lab), (Publication) Nodes (Fig. 1, Bottom Three Purple Nodes) The nodes on the bottom of the model are yet another three categories that indicate valuable afﬁliation information, allowing for visualization of collaboration networks. The current graph has a corpus of 260 publications that served as a basis for the co- authorship network as well as input for populating the boundary object nodes. 6 Discussion In this paper, we have proposed a graph model to support interdisciplinary Ph.D. students in their academic journey by encoding both explicit and tacit/experiential knowledge to make ‘insider’ information crucial for this population [4, 7] available to newcomers. Upon demonstrating the current knowledge graph and querying options, the majority of participants in the third workshop had positive attitudes toward the perspective of this technology being implemented, emphasizing its usefulness for newly admitted students. We therefore suggest that the approach of engaging community members to iden- tify and help aggregate into a knowledge graph both formal and informal information they ﬁnd relevant to success in the domain is a promising avenue for other groups and knowledge management applications. Some of the comments on the utility of having data from multiple web locations aggregated in the knowledge graph versus the online search were: “Direct, in one platform” and “More easily accessible information” 486 S. Gardasevic and R. Gazan 6.1 Transfer of Tacit Knowledge As mentioned, one of the most important factors in PhD student retention is related to their satisfaction with their research supervisor and faculty collaborations [3, 31]. Even though some of the students expressed their hesitance to leave written traces of their experiences with supervisors, the data (encoded in the reﬂection attribute) gathered via the form captured the experience of students who took directed readings courses with two faculty members, clearly indicating the differences in their styles of supervision: E.g. 1 - Very helpful, because [they] give you exactly what to do, speciﬁc advice- tools, websites, etc. E.g., 2 - They are really hands-off, which can be a problem if you want direction. The student-provided data support the decision-making process, and upon inspecting reﬂections of students on different exams they have taken, the latest cohort student was able to make a more informed decision when choosing a focus area exam: Reading through what you’ve collected from students was helpful. I’m all for data-driven decisions:). At the same time, the graph-based technology allows for recording the collaborations of current students with faculty, and better possibility to exchange tacit knowledge and student reﬂections upon establishing relationships with peers. However, for the proposed approach to be successfully implemented, some of the motivators (e.g. self-efﬁcacy, self- enjoyment, reciprocity, and rewards) [39] need to be enacted, within the system or the program policy, to entice the continuity in knowledge sharing practices among peers. Finally, the format of workshops to discuss these issues was also proven to make a dif- ference as the community building effort, considering they reported lack of opportunities to exchange information with peers [10]. Participating students labeled the experience as “insightful” and “enlightening”. 6.2 Affordances of Graph Modeled Approach The graph supports both speciﬁc curiosity (e.g. Fig. 3) as well as exploratory search [40] this user population considers useful. The current iteration of the created knowledge graph has 5,365 node instances (about 122 are CIS-afﬁliated people) and 6,116 relationships among them, making it a small- scale but rich-in-context dataset, created to explore visualization and navigation options. This dataset has double the layers and sample size of the graph created by [28] and the model was designed by researchers immersed in the domain created with the end users’ involvement - all of which are considered necessary to tackle the complex problem of multiplex visualizations [12] - issue that will be addressed in the future participatory design workshops. We provided this dataset to other researchers who are interested in examining the stated problem. Aside from serving the PhD student population, this research aims to tackle chal- lenges encountered by iSchools faculty involved in interdisciplinary research [36] with a domain analytical angle to build the vocabularies and capture disciplinary norms via Community Design of a Knowledge Graph 487 Fig. 3. Example query showing faculty from different departments conducting qualitative research ‘boundary object’ nodes, and possibly facilitate the collaboration of researchers with different disciplinary traditions looking at the same domain of application. 7 Conclusion Anyone who remembers their ﬁrst days in a graduate program can appreciate the inade- quacy of relying solely on formal program documentation as a guide to the overall expe- rience. By engaging students through iterative workshops, we propose a network-based visualization and discovery tool that integrates topical research data, degree require- ments, and the tacit knowledge by which a program’s culture–and its members’ lived experiences–are communicated. With it, students can capture their progress, plan/project future steps and collabora- tions, and see themselves as part of the community, subcommunity, and/or an invisible college, while providing valuable information and tacit knowledge traces for the other students. This approach emphasizes an active role for both information seekers and sharers, by putting the people within the community in the center of the information retrieval loop, to allow a direct exchange of trusted tacit information. We discovered that some of the tacit knowledge can be explicitly encoded, while most of it must stay within the 488 S. Gardasevic and R. Gazan community. The graph-based visualization of the social and knowledge network can serve as a pointer toward the people having the relevant information, one can reach out to, online or in person. Preserving and aggregating these traces via a knowledge graph and presenting them as a contrast with the common model of a generic student progressing through generic degree milestones, can yield a valuable visualization of the traces of departmental culture, and provide a more useful, accurate, and compassionate roadmap through an interdisciplinary graduate program.
