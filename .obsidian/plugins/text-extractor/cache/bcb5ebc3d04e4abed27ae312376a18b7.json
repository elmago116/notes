The tutorial explains the design rationale and various applications of CiteSpace – a freely available tool for interactive and exploratory analysis of the evolution of a scientific domain, ranging from a single specialty to multiple interrelated scientific frontiers. The tutorial demonstrates the analytic procedure of applying CiteSpace to a diverse range of examples and how one may interpret various patterns and trends revealed by interactive visual analytics.magnetic field, applied along the easy axis of the elements1.

The tutorial explains the design rationale and various applications of CiteSpace – a freely available tool for interactive and exploratory analysis of the evolution of a scientific domain, ranging from a single specialty to multiple interrelated scientific frontiers [1,2,8]. The tutorial demonstrates the analytic procedure of applying CiteSpace to a diverse range of examples and how one may interpret various patterns and trends revealed by interactive visual analytics.magnetic field, applied along the easy axis of the elements. Figure 1: A network visualization showing citation burstness in CiteSpace. The tutorial is suitable for anyone who is interested in learning and applying an effective method to generate a systematic review of the history and the state of the art of a scientific field. For example, doctoral students may gain an insightful understanding of a research topic by identifying landmark studies in the development of the field, critical contributions in the past, and potentially transformative ideas. Experienced researchers may repeatedly apply the same procedure to keep abreast new developments in a new field as well as in the field where they have established expertise. TutorialCHIIR’18, March 11-15, 2018, New Brunswick, NJ, USA369 CiteSpace has been applied to the study of numerous scientific disciplines. CiteSpace has been instrumental in revealing insightful patterns from a set of relevant scholarly publications (Fig. 1-5). On the other hand, users may considerably improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the application of such a visual analytic procedure through demonstrations and interpretations offered by the tutorial. Figure 2: A visualization of a tree of keywords in CiteSpace. Figure 3: A visualization of clusters in CiteSpace. Figure 4: A timeline visualization in CiteSpace. Figure 5: A dual-map overlay visualization in CiteSpace [5]. The half-day tutorial first introduces the basic concepts, relevant theories, and design rationale. Then the tutorial demonstrates several representative cases produced by CiteSpace, such as [3–7], so as to illustrate the breadth and depth of CiteSpace applications. Next, the tutorial guides the participants through step-by-step demonstrations from retrieving the initial input data to interpreting and summarizing the findings. On completion of the tutorial, participants should be able to apply the procedure to a domain of their own choice.
