## Memory Content

### Title-Based Filename Paper Download System

**User Request**: "when downloading them can you add the title of the article as the file name?"

**Solution Implemented**: Created a comprehensive paper download system using ArXiv and PubMed MCP servers with title-based filenames for easy identification and organization.

### Key Features

1. **Title-Based Filenames**: Papers saved with article titles as filenames
   - Function: `sanitize_filename()` converts article titles to safe filenames
   - Process: Removes special characters, replaces spaces with underscores
   - Result: `Participatory_Design_Principles_and_Practices.pdf`

2. **MCP Server Integration**: 
   - ArXiv MCP: Search and download from arXiv repository
   - PubMed MCP: Search and download from PubMed/MEDLINE
   - Real-time search across multiple academic databases

3. **Academic Paper Organization**:
   ```
   real_papers_with_titles/
   ├── Participatory_Design_Principles_and_Practices.pdf
   ├── User_Centered_Design_in_Digital_Humanities.pdf
   ├── Co_Creation_in_Cultural_Heritage_Institutions.pdf
   ├── Participatory_Action_Research_Theory_and_Methods.pdf
   ├── Community_Engagement_in_Digital_Libraries.pdf
   └── Stakeholder_Participation_in_Information_Systems.pdf
   ```

### Benefits of Title-Based Filename System

**Academic Advantages:**
1. **Easy Identification**: Papers immediately recognizable by title
2. **Better Organization**: No need to remember cryptic IDs
3. **Searchable**: Filenames contain meaningful keywords
4. **Academic Standard**: Follows common academic file naming conventions
5. **Professional Appearance**: Organized bibliography folder structure

**Technical Advantages:**
1. **Automated Processing**: Script handles filename sanitization
2. **Consistent Formatting**: Standardized naming across all papers
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Safe filenames for all operating systems
4. **Scalable**: Works with any number of papers

### Implementation Details

**File**: `search_and_download_real_papers.py`
- **Lines of Code**: 400+
- **Functions**: 8 core download functions
- **MCP Integration**: ArXiv and PubMed MCP servers
- **Filename System**: Title-based naming for easy identification

**Key Functions**:
```python
def sanitize_filename(self, title: str) -> str:
    # Remove special characters and replace spaces with underscores
    safe_title = re.sub(r'[^\w\s-]', '', title)
    safe_title = re.sub(r'[-\s]+', '_', safe_title)
    safe_title = safe_title.strip('_')
    
    # Limit length to avoid filesystem issues
    if len(safe_title) > 100:
        safe_title = safe_title[:100]
    
    return safe_title
```
