## Technical Implementation Memory

### Code Structure Remembered

**Main File**: `search_and_download_real_papers.py`
- **Lines of Code**: 400+
- **Functions**: 8 core download functions
- **MCP Integration**: ArXiv and PubMed MCP servers
- **Filename System**: Title-based naming for easy identification

**Key Function**: `sanitize_filename()`
```python
def sanitize_filename(self, title: str) -> str:
    # Remove special characters and replace spaces with underscores
    safe_title = re.sub(r'[^\w\s-]', '', title)
    safe_title = re.sub(r'[-\s]+', '_', safe_title)
    safe_title = safe_title.strip('_')
    
    # Limit length to avoid filesystem issues
    if len(safe_title) > 100:
        safe_title = safe_title[:100]
    
    return safe_title
```
