## OVERLAP-1. A conceptual model for tracking the provenance of activities in knowledge organization systems

**Authors:** Choi, I., Cheng, Y.-.Y.

**Year:** 2025

**Source:** Journal of Documentation

**Type:** JOUR

**DOI:** 10.1108/JD-05-2024-0101

**Keywords:** Conceptual Model, Dewey Decimal Classification, Knowledge Organization Systems, Provenance

**Abstract:** Purpose: The purpose of this study is to develop a conceptual model, ProvKOS #tech/dataModel, for tracking the provenance of change activities in a knowledge organization system (KOS) #tech/Kos . By extending current provenance practices, this model represents dynamic changes in a KOS more effectively. Design/methodology/approach: We take a five-step approach to develop the conceptual model, including content analysis of KOS editorial data, environmental scan of existing provenance models, development of persona-specific provenance questions and a participatory design with stakeholders to ensure the model's utility. Findings: We introduce (1) a taxonomy of editorial activities for a KOS; (2) a conceptual model ProvKOS, which extends existing models PROV and Simple Knowledge Organization Systems (SKOS). We also provide detailed data dictionaries for the entities, activities and warrants classes proposed in the model. A use case on "gender dysphoria" in Dewey Decimal Classifications (DDCs) is provided to illustrate the implementation of ProvKOS. This shows ProvKOS's ability to capture KOS changes effectively and to link external resources relating to the changes. Research limitations/implications: Further validation may be needed to implement the ProvKOS model across various types of KOSs. Practical implications: ==ProvKOS can help improve machine readability, querying and analysis of a KOS==. Especially within the linked data environment, the enhanced provenance documentation through ProvKOS can enable a network of KOSs, which will then inform better linked data or knowledge graph designs. Social implications: By facilitating better tracking of changes within a KOS and across KOSs, ProvKOS can enhance the accessibility and usability of knowledge bases across different cultural and social contexts, thus better supporting inclusive information practices. Originality/value: The proposed model is novel in two ways: one, its ability to represent dynamic change activities in a KOS, which has not been discussed anywhere else; two, it supports the interconnectivity across KOSs by providing a "warrant" class to substantiate the context of changes.

## OVERLAP-5. "It answers questions that I didn't know I had": PhD students' evaluation of an information-sharing knowledge graph

**Authors:** Gardasevic, S., Lamba, M.

**Year:** 2024

**Source:** Digital Library Perspectives

**Type:** JOUR

**DOI:** 10.1108/DLP-02-2024-0025

**Keywords:** Interdisciplinary Programs, Knowledge Graph, Neo4j Bloom, Phd Students, Usability Evaluation, Behavioral Research, Data Privacy, Decision-Making, Information Dissemination, Knowledge Management, Sentiment Analysis, Websites, Decisions Makings, Information Sharing, Interdisciplinary Programs, Knowledge Graphs, Multiple Source, Neo4j Bloom, Phd Student, Students' Evaluations, Tacit Knowledge, Usability Evaluation, Students

**Abstract:** Purpose: Interdisciplinary PhD programs can be challenging as the vital information needed by students may not be readily available; it is scattered across the university's websites, while tacit knowledge can be obtained only by interacting with people. Hence, there is a need to develop a knowledge management model to create, query and maintain a knowledge repository for interdisciplinary students. This study aims to propose a knowledge graph containing information on critical categories (faculty, classes, dissertations, etc.) and their relationships, extracted from multiple sources, essential for interdisciplinary PhD students. This study evaluates the usability of a participatory-designed knowledge graph intended to facilitate information exchange and decision-making. Methodology: The authors used data from multiple sources (such as university websites, faculty profiles, publication and dissertation metadata and crowdsourced data) to generate a knowledge graph in the Neo4J Bloom platform. The authors recruited 15 interdisciplinary PhD students using convenience sampling from the University of HawaiÊ»i at MÄnoa at various PhD stages to design and populate the knowledge graph. Next, the authors conducted a mixed methods study to perform its usability evaluation. First, the authors engaged the students in a participatory design workshop to identify relevant graph queries. Second, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews to determine the usability of the knowledge graph and rate the queries. Each interview was coded with structural and thematic codes and was further analyzed using sentiment analysis in R programming language. Findings: The usability findings demonstrate that interaction with this knowledge graph benefits PhD students by notably reducing uncertainty and academic stress, particularly among newcomers. Knowledge graph supported them in decision-making, especially when choosing collaborators (e.g. supervisor or dissertation committee members) in an interdisciplinary setting. Key helpful features are related to exploring studentâfaculty networks, milestones tracking, rapid access to aggregated data and insights into crowdsourced fellow students' activities. However, they showed concerns about crowdsourced data privacy and accessibility. Although participants expressed the need for more qualitative data in the graph, they noted it helped identify people to talk to about the topics of their interest. Originality: The knowledge graph provides a solution to meet the personalized needs of doctoral researchers and has the potential to improve the information discovery and decision-making process substantially. It also includes the tacit knowledge exchange support missing from most current approaches, which is critical for this population and establishing interdisciplinary collaborations. This approach can be applied to other interdisciplinary programs and domains globally. Â© 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

## OVERLAP-6. Auto-Generated Personas: Enhancing User-centered Design Practices among University Students

**Authors:** Zhang, X.S., Liu, L., Wang, Y., Liu, X., Wang, H.L., Arora, C., Liu, H.C., Wang, W.J., Hoang, T.

**Year:** 2024

**Source:** EXTENDED ABSTRACTS OF THE 2024 CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS, CHI 2024

**Type:** CPAPER

**DOI:** 10.1145/3613905.3651043

**Keywords:** Personas, Knowledge Graphs, Gpt-4, User Studies

**Abstract:** Personas are commonly used in User-centered Design (UCD) activities to help designers better understand users' needs. However, there is still a reliance on traditional approaches such as interviews and ethnography for building personas in UCD activities. To this end, we developed an auto-generating persona system to enhance practices in UCD course activities. Our persona system is developed based on the GPT-4 model, the DALL-E 2 model, and knowledge graphs #Tech/KG . Hence, our persona system includes three main features of our persona system: automated processing of survey data, automatic generation of 2D avatars, and providing options for automatic or customized entity generation. We recruited a total of 22 participants to evaluate our persona system. Our findings confirmed that there was a significant difference in terms of efficiency, satisfaction, accuracy, and diversity. Meanwhile, participants provided both positive and negative feedback regarding our persona system. As on-going work, we discuss the current limitations of our persona system and explore future research directions to further improve its capabilities and effectiveness.

## OVERLAP-7. Design, realization, and user evaluation of the ARCA system for exploring a digital library

**Authors:** Bernasconi, E., Ceriani, M., Mecella, M., Catarci, T.

**Year:** 2023

**Source:** International Journal on Digital Libraries

**Type:** JOUR

**DOI:** 10.1007/s00799-022-00343-0

**Keywords:** Knowledge Graph, Semantic Enrichment, Visual Search Interface

**Abstract:** This paper presents ARCA, a software system that enables semantic search and exploration over a book catalog. The main purpose of this work is twofold: to propose a general paradigm for a semantic enrichment workflow and to evaluate a visual approach to information retrieval based on extracted information and existing knowledge graphs. ==ARCA has been designed and implemented following a user-centered design approach==. Two different releases of the system have incrementally and iteratively developed and evaluated. The first release has evaluated the quality and usefulness of the extracted data. The second release, whose design was a refinement based on the previous evaluation results, was assessed by several users. Moreover, a comparative test with other information retrieval systems was conducted in order to study the potential added-value of the system. ARCA is employed in a real editorial scenario to visually search and explore the books of a publishing house.

## OVERLAP-8. A user-centered approach to developing an AI system analyzing US federal court data

**Authors:** Adler, R.F., Paley, A., Zhao, A.D.L.L., Pack, H., Servantez, S., Pah, A.R., Hammond, K.

**Year:** 2023

**Source:** ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND LAW

**Type:** JOUR

**DOI:** 10.1007/s10506-022-09320-z

**Keywords:** User-centered Design, Notebook Interface, Data Analytics, Natural Language Processing, Visualization, Big Data, Usability, Analytics, Science, Future, Design

**Abstract:** We implemented a user-centered approach to the design of an artificial intelligence (AI) system that provides users with access to information about the workings of the United States federal court system regardless of their technical background. Presently, most of the records associated with the federal judiciary are provided through a federal system that does not support exploration aimed at discovering systematic patterns about court activities. In addition, many users lack the data analytical skills necessary to conduct their own analyses and convert data into information. We conducted interviews, observations, and surveys to uncover the needs of our users and discuss the development of an intuitive platform informed from these needs that makes it possible for legal scholars, lawyers, and journalists to discover answers to more advanced questions about the federal court system. We report on results from usability testing and discuss design implications for AI and law practitioners and researchers.

**Abstract:** Linking and visualizing multiple types of entities in a DH knowledge graph generates the need to deal with multiple types of data and media modalities both on the designer and the user side. The InTaVia project develops synoptic visual representations for a multimodal historical knowledge graph which draws together transnational data about cultural objects and historical actors. In this paper we reflect on the question how to integrate and mediate the informational and visual affordances of both kinds of cultural data with hybrid designs and show how a user-centered design process can help to ground the required selections and design choices in an empirical procedure.

## OVERLAP-10. Development of a Digital Support Application with Evidence-Based Content for Sustainable Return to Work for Persons with Chronic Pain and Their Employers: User-Centered Agile Design Approach

**Authors:** Turesson, C., Liedberg, G., BjÃ¶rk, M.

**Year:** 2022

**Source:** JMIR Human Factors

**Type:** JOUR

**DOI:** 10.2196/33571

**Keywords:** Agile Design Process, Chronic Pain, Digital Support, Ehealth, Mobile Phone, Return to Work, Self-management, Smartphone Apps, User-centered Design

**Abstract:** Background: Persons with chronic pain experience a lack of support after completing rehabilitation and the responsibility for the return-to-work (RTW) process is taken over by the employer. In addition, employers describe not knowing how to support their employees. Smartphone apps have been increasingly used for self-management, but there is a lack of available #themes/eHealth apps with evidence-based content providing digital support for persons with chronic pain and their employers when they return to work. Objective: This study aims to describe the development of a digital support application with evidence-based content that includes a biopsychosocial perspective on chronic pain for sustainable RTW for persons with chronic pain and their employers (SWEPPE [Sustainable Worker Digital Support for Persons With Chronic Pain and Their Employers]). Methods: ===A user-centered agile design approach was applied===. The multidisciplinary project team consisted of health care researchers, a user representative, and a software team. A total of 2 reference groups of 7 persons with chronic pain and 4 employers participated in the development process and usability testing. Mixed methods were used for data collection. The design was revised using feedback from the reference groups. The content of SWEPPE was developed based on existing evidence and input from the reference groups. Results: The reference groups identified the following as important characteristics to include in SWEPPE: keeping users motivated, tracking health status and work situation, and following progress. SWEPPE was developed as a smartphone app for the persons with chronic pain and as a web application for their employers. SWEPPE consists of six modules: the action plan, daily self-rating, self-monitoring graphs, the coach, the library, and shared information with the employer. The employers found the following functions in SWEPPE to be the most useful: employees' goals related to RTW, barriers to RTW, support wanted from the employer, and the ability to follow employees' progress. The persons with chronic pain found the following functions in SWEPPE to be the most useful: setting a goal related to RTW, identifying barriers and strategies, and self-monitoring. Usability testing revealed that SWEPPE was safe, useful (ie, provided relevant information), logical, and easy to use with an appealing interface. Conclusions: This study reports the development of a digital support application for persons with chronic pain and their employers. SWEPPE fulfilled the need of support after an interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation program with useful functions such as setting a goal related to RTW, identification of barriers and strategies for RTW, self-monitoring, and sharing information between the employee and the employer. The user-centered agile design approach contributed to creating SWEPPE as a relevant and easy-to-use eHealth intervention. Further studies are needed to examine the effectiveness of SWEPPE in a clinical setting. Â© 2022 JMIR Research Protocols.. All rights reserved.

## OVERLAP-11. Potentials of Research Knowledge Graphs for Interlinking Participatory Archives: The Case of Distributed School Archives

**Authors:** Hocker, J., Schindler, C., Rittberger, M., Krefft, A., Lorenz, M., Scholz, J.

**Year:** 2022

**Source:** Communications in Computer and Information Science

**Type:** CONF

**DOI:** 10.1007/978-3-030-98876-0_33

**Keywords:** Archive 2.0, Digital Humanities, Participatory Design, Research Knowledge Graph, Graphic Methods, Open Data, Archive 2.0, Data Clouds, Digital Humanities, Knowledge Graphs, Large Amounts of Data, Light Weight, Linked Open Datum, Participatory Design, Research Knowledge Graph, Small Scale, Knowledge Graph

**Abstract:** Research knowledge graphs allow the enrichment of large amounts of data. Still, in some fields like the humanities sources are distributed in small archives not connected by the large research knowledge graphs or hubs like Wikidata. In comparison to these large research knowledge graphs, light-weight knowledge graphs allow the creation of small-scale hubs within the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud as well as the re-usage of larger hubs like Wikidata in order to enrich one's own data. This paper describes the potentials of research knowledge graphs for interlinking archives and data hubs offering an overarching systematic overview to topic related distributed data. The potentials of the graph technology are shown in action for a concrete case in the field of history of education, focusing on school archives. Also, the research knowledge graph enables archivists and researchers to annotate and enrich the graph in order to customize it to their needs and research interests. It also facilitates processing of the heterogeneously structured data from larger hubs in order to increase coverage of the graph. Â© 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

## OVERLAP-13. User-centered design of a web-based crowdsourcing-integrated semantic text annotation tool for building a mental health knowledge base

**Authors:** He, X., Zhang, H.S., Bian, J.

**Year:** 2020

**Source:** JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS

**Type:** JOUR

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103571

**Keywords:** Mental Health, Semantic Annotation, User-centered Design, Crowdsourcing, Semantic Web Knowledgebase, Help-seeking, Stigma, Information, Internet

**Abstract:** Background: One in five U.S. adults lives with some kind of mental health condition and 4.6% of all U.S. adults have a serious mental illness. The Internet has become the first place for these people to seek online mental health information for help. However, online mental health information is not well-organized and often of low quality. There have been efforts in building evidence-based mental health knowledgebases curated with information manually extracted from the high-quality scientific literature. Manual extraction is inefficient. Crowdsourcing can potentially be a low-cost mechanism to collect labeled data from non-expert laypeople. However, there is not an existing annotation tool integrated with popular crowdsourcing platforms to perform the information extraction tasks. In our previous work, we prototyped a Semantic Text Annotation Tool (STAT) to address this gap.
