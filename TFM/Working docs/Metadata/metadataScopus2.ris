AB  - The use of AI systems for managing large-scale cultural heritage artifacts has become possible due to the rise of digitization. To classify such content, machine learning is typically used, where contextual information is important to structure the data. One way to capture context is through a knowledge graph. In this study, we propose a newd graph neural networks, we can improve artwork classification by utilizing the relationships between entities of the knowledge graph. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple classification tasks across three datasets (SemArt paintings, Buddha statues, and Ukiyo-e woodblock prints). Moreover, our approach is effective in dealing with unbalanced data and we explore the use of both graph attention mechanisms and focal loss functions. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Automated classification of electronic archive text’s can improve document management efficiency, support rapid information retrieval, and enhance data analysis capabilities, thus helping to achieve efficient use of information resources and knowledge management. However, medium-scale archival text classification needs to deal with complex natural languages as well as deal with noise, ambiguity and sparsity in unstructured text data. In order to solve the above problems, this work proposes a knowledge graph-K-modes clustering algorithm-CTransR-Full-K-Modes for archival text classification. Firstly, existing knowledge representation learning modes and dissimilarity measures in clustering algorithms are analysed. Next, we provide a representation learning model called CTransR. This model is based on hyperparameter tuning and relation matrix projection. Its major purpose is to address the issue of poor recognition capacity in the current TransR model while dealing with distinct entities that have great resemblance. Allocate items and relations into distinct vector spaces. The hyperparameter tuning principle and a priori probability based on the use of relations are employed to distinguish relations that encode similarity, thus facilitating the process of knowledge fusion in archival knowledge mapping. Finally, a full attribute-valued K-Modes algorithm-Full-K-Modes for archival knowledge graphs is proposed to achieve clustering processing of archival texts using preclustering-based multi-attribute-valued clustering centres and their corresponding dissimilarity measures to mitigate the effects of local optimal cases. The experimental results show that the proposed CTransR-Full-K-Modes algorithm can effectively improve the accuracy of the clustering results of ordered-type categorical data, and achieve the purpose of automatic categorisation mining for mediumsized digital archives. © 2025 J.

AB  - To solve the problem of ineffective extraction of advanced features that reflect the essence of customer behavior and enhance customer stickiness. A deep perception method for customer behavior in digital business halls based on multimodal data integration has been proposed. Retrieve multimodal customer information from the multimodal data platform layer of the digital business hall, including text, voice, images, and videos, as data sources. The data collection layer utilizes different collection nodes to collect this data. The data feature layer uses Deep Belief Networks (DBN) to extract features from collected multimodal data and integrate them into a multimodal data feature library to achieve feature integration of customer multimodal data. Using naive Bayes classification method, customer behavior is classified into three categories based on the characteristics of multimodal data: basic information, behavioral information, and service information. The ontology search and semantic extension technology effectively solve the semantic heterogeneity problem of information integration perception in customer basic information and service information perception, providing customers with more complete information query results. Provide customers with high-quality knowledge resources closely related to their behavior based on their level of knowledge needs. The experimental results show that the sliding window length of this method is suitable between 240 and 260 in the processing of multimodal data streams, with high data integration accuracy and strong advantages in deep perception of customer behavior information. It can significantly improve the service quality of digital business offices and enhance customer stickiness. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - The display methods for traditional cultural heritage lack personalization and emotional interaction, making it difficult to stimulate the public’s deep cultural awareness. This is especially true in commercialized historical districts, where cultural value is easily overlooked. Balancing cultural value and commercial value in information display has become one of the challenges that needs to be addressed. To solve the above problems, this article focuses on the identification of deep cultural values and the optimization of the information display in Beijing’s Qianmen Street, proposing a framework for cultural information mining and display based on affective computing and large language models. The pre-trained models QwenLM and RoBERTa were employed to analyze text and image data from user-generated content on social media, identifying users’ emotional tendencies toward various cultural value dimensions and quantifying their multilayered understanding of architectural heritage. This study further constructed a multimodal information presentation model driven by emotional feedback, mapping it into virtual reality environments to enable personalized, multilayered cultural information visualization. The framework’s effectiveness was validated through an eye-tracking experiment that assessed how different presentation styles impacted users’ emotional engagement and cognitive outcomes. The results show that the affective computing and multimodal data fusion approach to cultural heritage presentation accurately captures users’ emotions, enhancing their interest and emotional involvement. Personalized presentations of information significantly improve users’ engagement, historical understanding, and cultural experience, thereby fostering a deeper comprehension of historical contexts and architectural details. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: Arts therapies (ATs) for the treatment of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has attracted widespread attention from scholars. However, resources, technical, and ethical issues still pose significant obstacles to current research. A collaborative design approach is needed to guide the intervention treatment process involving multiple stakeholders. Therefore, this study focuses on exploring the current status, development and potential value of the collaborative arts therapies (CATs), providing a comprehensive perspective for subsequent research. Methods: The Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library were searched for publications up to August 30, 2023, related to the use of CATs for the treatment of ASD. CiteSpace was used to build a knowledge graph to achieve visual analysis of current research countries, institutions, journals, authors, and hot topics. Results: A total of 845 articles met the inclusion criteria. In terms of quantity, the USA is the leading country which has the greatest influence in advancing the field. The University of Haifa is the most productive institution. Arteterapia Papeles De Arteterapia Y Educacion Artistica and Frontiers in Psychology occupy key publishing positions. The most central keywords were related to the quality of life of people with ASD. “family”, “social robot” and “participation” are emerging topics in the research field. The positive impact of the combination of caregivers, technology and artistic media on enhancing connections between people with ASD and their everyday environment is the focus of current research. Conclusions: Research on CATs as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of ASD is evolving. Providing comprehensive rehabilitation and support intervention for patients with ASD is a key research direction. The research process requires more interdisciplinary resources and technical assistance. Collaboration will be the best way to improve the effectiveness of ATs. © 2024

AB  - As ontologies grow in complexity and breadth, domain experts often struggle to understand their intricacies without the assistance of semantic experts. As a result, the ontologies themselves can become significant obstacles in constructing reusable and consistent knowledge graphs of their data following these standards. To address these challenges, this contribution presents the Semantic Reference Data Model (SRDM) modelling method, a protocol that offers a practical approach to (i) simplifying ontological complexity, (ii) standardising semantic patterns and (iii) facilitating the creation of new knowledge graphs. SRDM provides a solution for overcoming conceptual challenges by offering a catalogue of entity-based templates, whereby recognisable entities within a domain are documented in single templates composed of ready-made and distinct ontological patterns covering the entity’s most documented attributes. The limited number of elements available, the use of domain-specific language, and the correspondence between documented objects and real-world items make the SRDMs particularly easy to grasp, helping bridge the gap between semantic and domain experts. A case study is used to illustrate the framework’s application in the cultural sector, specifically highlighting the advantages obtained in documentation, data consistency, and external data ingestion. The case study demonstrates how SRDMs can vastly simplify the creation and management of knowledge graphs, helping Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage communities easily share essential and useful datasets. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - The fine-grained mining and construction of semantic associations within multimodal intangible cultural heritage (ICH) resources are crucial for deepening our understanding of their knowledge content and ensuring their systematic protection and transmission in the digital and intelligent era. This paper addresses the urgent need for the digital preservation and transmission of ICH resources. Following a review of current research on Qingyang sachets and ICH, the study introduces an ontology-based approach to constructing a semantic description model for the multimodal digital resources related to Qingyang sachets. By acquiring and processing multimodal resources concerning the craftsmanship and associated customs of Qingyang sachets, the study reorganizes the corresponding textual and visual knowledge. Utilizing knowledge graphs, the research explores multidimensional pathways for delivering knowledge services related to the multimodal digital resources of Qingyang sachets. Empirical research confirms the applicability and feasibility of the proposed semantic association scheme for multimodal ICH digital resources. The findings provide valuable insights for multidimensional organization and integration across scenarios, time periods, and resources within the ICH domain, offering a reference for digital solutions aimed at the systematic protection of ICH. © 2025 Liang et al.

AB  - Many museums are interested in addressing the presence of problematic terminology in their catalogue data but are uncertain of what they should look for and what do to when a problematic term is encountered. There is an opportunity to address the lack of guidance and scarcity of resources available for museums looking to engage with this work through the use of linked open data in order to create a knowledge graph that links together machine-readable versions of terminology guidance from multiple sources and then further connects them to additional lexicographical resources. The resulting knowledge graph can then be leveraged to support critical cataloguing tasks—namely confirming a term as problematic in a given context and making a decision of how to proceed—by providing cataloguers with the information they need to perform their work. This approach seeks to meet the needs of museum professionals to have access to domain best practice while allowing for localization of recommendations. This research seeks to understand what kinds of language museums are concerned with, how museums are thinking about what makes a term problematic, what possible reparative actions museums feel are appropriate given different contexts, and what kinds of information museum professionals look for to make a decision about which action to take. This work is taking place as part of a Collaborative Doctoral Partnership studentship co-supervised by the University of Oxford and the Victoria and Albert Museum, and as such the Victoria and Albert Museum serves as the case study for the exploration of this research area. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - With the development of society and technological progress, people pay more and more attention to the inheritance, protection and promotion of cultural heritage. Under the conditions of new technology and new media, communication media and channels are changing rapidly. Improving the speed, breadth and accuracy of the dissemination of information on Guangdong culture in the new era is a new requirement of the times for the dissemination of Guangdong culture. In order to effectively improve the accuracy of Guandong culture recommendation, the study first built a human-machine interactive visual communication platform. Among them, the random forest algorithm was improved by incorporating word embedding technology to facilitate the acquisition of semantic similarity. In addition, it was combined with long-short feature embedding technology and a lightweight gradient boosting tree model, which enabled the acquisition of user interest preferences. The results showed that the model classification accuracy after combining long short-term feature embedding techniques reached 95%, which could better capture the time series features of user behavior. The platform built reduced the risk of overfitting and improved the generalization ability of the model through the integration of multiple decision trees in random forest. Light gradient boosting machine performed excellently and had high computational efficiency when processing large-scale data through an efficient gradient boosting framework. The platform thus built had a recommendation accuracy rate of 97%. At the same time, the platform obtained personalized and similar content recommendation test sections, and the test results were all passed. This proves that the platform can not only accurately recommend Guandong cultural content, but also provide a good communication experience through visualization, providing new ideas and methods for research and practice in the field of Guandong cultural communication. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Data in real-world applications are often presented in diverse formats, providing a rich and comprehensive description of instances. Multimodal Clustering (MMC) mines and integrates the complex correlations among these modalities in an unsupervised manner to improve clustering performance. With numerous real-world applications, the number of modalities has gradually increased over time. However, most existing MMC methods focus on scenarios with a fixed number of modalities and cannot cope with the incremental multimodal data. Considering the rich inter-modal correlations and potential knowledge flows in multimodal data, we propose a contrastive Propagation Network (ProNet) for multimodal lifelong clustering. It jointly considers Global Correlation Reservation (GCR) among all modalities and Local Knowledge Transfer (LKT) between neighboring modalities within a unified framework. When a new modality arrives, we contrast the feature of the new modality with its global neighbors in all existing modalities to achieve GCR, which is realized by maintaining a dynamic feature library. Next, we design a self-supervised distillation strategy to enable the previous modality to guide the learning of the new modality, which implies knowledge transfer between neighboring modalities. The cooperation of GCR and LKT ensures that the model efficiently performs the clustering task for each new modality while continuously learning and accumulating inter-modal correlations. The experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that ProNet outperforms many state-of-the-art MMC methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Dura-Europos Stories is a web application leveraging a presentation framework powered by linked open data for digital storytelling. The framework emphasizes the display of interactive multimedia content, in this case related to archaeological excavations from Dura-Europos, an ancient site in present-day Syria. We introduce a set of schemas in the Shape Expressions (ShEx) language published in Wikidata’s schema namespace that we use in the context of WikiProject International (Digital) Dura-Europos Archive (IDEA). WikiProject IDEA is an international, multilingual group of Wikidata editors who curate data related to Dura-Europos. This data is then reused within the Dura-Europos Stories application to automatically curate visualizations related to the archaeological site and the artifacts found there. Members of the WikiProject use ShEx schemas to encode data models that the group has created for items they maintain in Wikidata. They share these schemas on the pages of their WikiProject and track the updates to the schemas in Wikidata’s schema namespace. These schemas are both human readable and machine readable and can be used to validate entity data from Wikidata. Schema-based validation provides editors with a way to monitor data from the knowledge base relevant to their project and allows nontechnical curators a way to develop virtual, interactive viewing guides without needing to read or write code. © 2025 Common Ground Research Networks.

AB  - In the industrial sector, index-based fault knowledge graph query techniques are essential for accelerating fault information retrieval and improving the accuracy and e±ciency of diagnosing equipment issues. Using knowledge graph embedding, these systems transform entities and their relationships into dense vectors, making it easier for machine learning algorithms to process knowledge graph queries e®ectively. However, existing models often focus on boosting search accuracy at the cost of time e±ciency, particularly when dealing with large fault knowledge graphs. To address this, we propose an optimized query method for fault knowledge graphs using vector indexing. The process starts by converting the entities and relationships in the knowledge graph into a vector space, generating a concise vector representation. Advanced vector database technology is then employed to build a specialized vector index library designed for fault knowledge graphs. This includes dividing the search space through clustering algorithms and employing approximate matching techniques to enhance query speed. By utilizing the indexed fault knowledge graph, we can conduct similarity searches to facilitate approximate querying. Evaluations show that our approach signi¯cantly reduces search times and outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy, demonstrating the value of vector index libraries in boosting the overall query e±ciency of knowledge graphs, while keeping high accuracy levels. © 2025 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Risk management and control of on-site power operations is an important link in the power production process. Traditional methods that rely on manual execution of safety rules lack proactive prevention and control capabilities, and insufficient efficiency leads to an increasing frequency of safety issues in power production. Therefore, it is urgent to adopt intelligent methods to improve the level of safety risk management and control. In response to this issue, the article proposes a multimodal causal knowledge graph based auxiliary decision-making method for safety risk management in power field operations. Based on the characteristics and requirements of safety risk management for on-site power operations, first obtain multimodal data related to safety risk management for on-site power operations, including video, photo, and text information collected by end devices, as well as historical archive data in various system databases. Then, based on historical risk management rules, the causal relationships of the core elements of on-site work safety issues are sorted out, and the data involved in the multiple types of antecedent influencing factors of historical faults and safety accidents are taken as the causes, and the faults and safety issues are taken as the results, forming a complete causal knowledge sample and constructing a causal effect estimation learning model. This model can output the safety risks of on-site power operations, forming a causal knowledge graph to provide auxiliary support for early warning and pre control decision-making of safety risks in on-site power operations. © 2025 SPIE.

AB  - Purpose: This research aims to provide a methodology for constructing a knowledge graph (KG) to map the evolution of Chinese embroidery by associating cultural space and critical incidents within the context of intangible cultural heritage (ICH). Design/methodology/approach: This study deconstructs the cultural space for ICH into physical, spiritual and societal dimensions and scrutinizes the structural components governing the evolution of embroidery projects. Utilizing examples from the four famous embroideries and four ethnic minority embroidery styles of China, we construct a KG connecting cultural space and critical incidents, enabling the storage, retrieval and discovery of knowledge about the evolution of embroideries. Findings: The societal dimension of the embroidery cultural space contains more diverse information than its physical and spiritual aspects. Critical events in the evolution of embroidery are categorized into 15 types and further distinguished as internal and external stimuli. Internal stimuli reflect the gradual, positive transformation of ICH embroidery driven by developmental needs. External stimuli often induce changes that are not always beneficial but directly impact the evolution of embroidery. Originality/value: This research offers fresh insights into ICH evolution by linking cultural space and critical incidents and enabling the exploration of implicit, potentially valuable and ultimately comprehensible information through knowledge visualization. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Abstract: Knowledge graphs are becoming increasingly popular for organizing and managing knowledge across various industries and academic fields. Knowledge graphs assist users to better understand domain knowledge by reorganizing and aggregating information. In the application scenario, recent research has mainly focused on constructing knowledge graphs to create narrative visualizations from the perspective of humanities expert, but the mapping relationship between knowledge graphs and narrative scripts which visualization designers specialize in remains largely unexplored. This paper aims to explore the use of cultural heritage knowledge graphs for producing narrative scripts that creatively preserve and communicate cultural heritage. To achieve this, the researchers constructed an ethnic costumes knowledge graph based on data collected from the Chinese National Museums of Ethnology and a literature survey. We conducted an experiment to identify typical patterns in data exploration and narrative scripts that linked to the designers’ authorial intent and process. Based on our analysis, we present design recommendations for narrative visualization with knowledge graphs that could provide practical guidance in designing cultural heritage information visualization. © The Visualization Society of Japan 2025.

AB  - In recent years, there is a notable increase in the use of LGBTQ+ ontologies and structured vocabularies in library systems, digital archives, online databases, heritages, etc. Many were published as linked data, including Homosaurus, QLIT, GSSO, etc. However, little has been reported about the links between the concepts captured by them. To study their interconnection, we retrieve all their published mappings as well as relevant information to form an integrated knowledge graph. We evaluate its usefulness with respect to three aspects. First, taking advantage of its weakly connected components, we study the discovery of missing links between entities. Second, we analyze concept drift and change by providing examples of concept convergence, ambiguity, and scope change. Moreover, we study how multilingual information from other resources can enrich entities using Homosaurus as an example. Finally, we discuss potential challenges and practical implications of our findings in the community. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - The dynamics of land prices in Alpine tourism regions are shaped by natural amenities, limited buildable land, and demand from second-home owners, posing significant challenges for sustainable regional development. This study examines the spatial impacts of alternative determinants of land value in Tyrol, Austria, including recreational activities, cultural heritage, and environmental features, using a Spatial Durbin Error Model (SDEM) while controlling for primary land value drivers. The results reveal skiing as the most influential recreational driver of land prices, with strong direct and spillover effects, while running and cycling activities show significant localized positive impacts, with the latter exhibiting nonlinear effects influenced by topographical and infrastructural variations across municipalities. Environmental features such as Natura 2000 protected areas and water areas consistently exhibit negative effects, reflecting restrictions on buildable land use. Cultural heritage positively impacts land values; however, its influence diminishes when control variables are introduced. The inclusion of controls enhances the model’s explanatory power, confirming the critical roles of tourism intensity, residential and leisure attractiveness in shaping land markets but it also underscores the relevance of the alternative determinants investigated, highlighting the delicate balance and inherent tensions between tourism growth, housing affordability, and environmental protection in Alpine regions. This emphasizes the necessity of sustainable land use strategies to manage these competing priorities effectively. Furthermore, the study leverages Strava heatmap data to provide advanced insights into physical activity patterns, demonstrating the potential of alternative and multimodal data in spatial econometric analysis. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Recently, cultural institutions have seen a rise in citizen curation projects, where people actively engage in curating and interpreting cultural artifacts. Citizen curation involves using collective knowledge and shared interests to create rich narratives around heritage items. This approach values the diverse perspectives individuals bring to preserving and representing culture. In this work, we investigate the potential of citizen curation applied to the subjective and culturally bound topic of symbolism. To do so, we present a pilot study on the development and user testing of the multivocal exhibition application. This application allows users to curate their art exhibitions by picking one theme and three cultural contexts that spark their interest. The app then selects artworks and symbolic data from HyperReal (cultural symbolism knowledge graph), Wikidata, and the National Museum of World Cultures (NMVW) to create a 3D environment featuring three artworks that symbolically convey the chosen theme from the perspective of the selected cultural contexts. The purpose of this app is to foster an open dialogue about the uniqueness and similarities of cultures, and promote inclusivity and cultural awareness, by showing how artifacts and what they depict can be interpreted in different cultural contexts, according to their symbology. Multivocal exhibition was tested by 12 users divided into 6 groups. The evaluation is based on the interaction between the users and the application, the analysis of the dialogues that were prompted utilizing the app, and an interview after trying two scenarios. Our results show how serendipity and surprise emerge as central themes in the cross-cultural experiences of the users. These elements play an indispensable role in cultivating engagement through symbolism, enriching users' comprehension of diverse cultures, and heightening overall engagement. Moreover, the cognitive gap intentionally created by the app - triggering questions about why specific symbols convey particular meanings within certain contexts - proves to be a potent stimulus for user curiosity and engagement. We report additional findings, lessons learned and future work at the end of the article.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Within the mHealth framework, systematic research that collects and analyzes patient data to establish comprehensive digital health archives for hypertensive patients, and leverages large language models (LLMs) to assist clinicians in health management and Blood Pressure (BP) control remains limited. In this study, our aims to describe the design, development and usability evaluation process of a management platform (Hyper-DREAM) for hypertension. Our multidisciplinary team employed an iterative design approach over the course of a year to develop the Hyper-DREAM platform. This platform's primary functionalities encompass multimodal data collection (personal hypertensive digital phenotype archive), multimodal interventions (BP measurement, medication assistance, behavior modification, and hypertension education) and multimodal interactions (clinician-patient engagement and BP Coach component). In August 2024, the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (MAUQ) was conducted involving 51 hypertensive patients recruited from three distinct centers. In parallel, six clinicians engaged in management activities and contributed feedback via the Doctor’s Software Satisfaction Questionnaire (DSSQ). Concurrently, a real-world comparative experiment was conducted to evaluate the usability of the BP Coach, ChatGPT-4o Mini, ChatGPT-4o and clinicians. The comparative experiment demonstrated that the BP Coach achieved significantly higher scores in utility (mean scores 4.05, SD 0.87) and completeness (mean scores 4.12, SD 0.78) when compared to ChatGPT-4o Mini, ChatGPT-4o, and clinicians. In terms of clarity, the BP Coach was slightly lower than clinicians (mean scores 4.03, SD 0.88). In addition, the BP Coach exhibited lower performance in conciseness (mean scores 3.00, SD 0.96). Clinicians reported a marked improvement in work efficiency (2.67 vs. 4.17, P <.001) and experienced faster and more effective patient interactions (3.0 vs. 4.17, P =.004). Furthermore, the Hyper-DREAM platform significantly decreased work intensity (2.5 vs. 3.5, P =.01) and minimized disruptions to daily routines (2.33 vs. 3.55, P =.004). The Hyper-DREAM platform demonstrated significantly greater overall satisfaction compared to the WeChat-based standard management (3.33 vs. 4.17, P =.01). Additionally, clinicians exhibited a markedly higher willingness to integrate the Hyper-DREAM platform into clinical practice (2.67 vs. 4.17, P <.001). Furthermore, patient management time decreased from 11.5 min (SD 1.87) with Wechat-based standard management to 7.5 min (SD 1.84, P =.01) with Hyper-DREAM. Hypertensive patients reported high satisfaction with the Hyper-DREAM platform, including ease of use (mean scores 1.60, SD 0.69), system information arrangement (mean scores 1.69, SD 0.71), and usefulness (mean scores 1.57, SD 0.58). In conclusion, our study presents Hyper-DREAM, a novel artificial intelligence-driven platform for hypertension management, designed to alleviate clinician workload and exhibiting significant promise for clinical application. The Hyper-DREAM platform is distinguished by its user-friendliness, high satisfaction rates, utility, and effective organization of information. Furthermore, the BP Coach component underscores the potential of LLMs in advancing mHealth approaches to hypertension management. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - Multi-robot collaboration is a crucial execution tool for mixed-model assembly lines. The rapid reconfiguration of the robots with impaired skills to maintain the robustness of the assembly line remains a significant challenge. With a focus on knowledge-driven faster transition technologies for collaborative robots, this paper proposes a Knowledge Sharing-enabled Low-code Program (KSLC) method to address the deficient skill migration and the limited scalability caused by programs written statically in open-loop control. First, considering collaborative robots' functional requirements and environmental constraints, the parameterized action primitive library of assembly skills is developed with properties across multiple perspectives, levels, and granularities. Complex assembly skills are then formally expressed using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Besides, digraph network model is created to represent action sequences and the corresponding parameters relevant to complex assembly tasks for the execution content. Finally, the DQN algorithm is utilized to learn low-dimensional vectors within the knowledge graph. The GraphSAGE algorithm is employed to facilitate skill search and matching, enabling the effective acquisition and transmission of robot skills. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed KSLC-enabled collaborative robots achieve 90 % average success rate in the TwoArmPegInHole task, significantly outperforming the traditional experience transfer strategies that only attain 58 % success rate. This finding indicates that KSLC can substantially enhance robot learning efficiency and task performance. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with Question Answering (QA) systems is transforming the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Through the combination of these technologies, novel features can be provided for the translation of questions in natural language into database queries. Even if a lot of work is emerging in this domain, this is not the case when we refer to translation of text to Cypher queries, where Cypher is one of the dominant query languages used for the development of KGs (e.g., based on the Neo4j technology). In this context, this paper provides a robust and efficient framework to systematically assess the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) to support Text-to-Cypher conversion, focusing on the evaluation of open-source LLMs. The framework utilizes metrics and validators offered by an open-source software library that we developed, called CyVer. This study also assesses the impact of different schema representations of the KG on schema-aware query generation and the performance of LLMs on questions of different complexity requiring a depth of reasoning on the KG. A case study is described based on the application of the detailed framework in a KG with a large and complex schema that hosts data to track information related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, highlight the importance of the size of open-source models in the semantic comprehension of questions and the generation of valid Cypher queries, and stress the challenge for the generation of accurate queries in the case of questions requiring complex Cypher logic. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - lncRNAs make up a large portion of the human genome affecting many biological processes in normal physiology and diseases. However, human lncRNAs are understudied compared to protein-coding genes. While there are many tools for performing gene set enrichment analysis for coding genes, few tools exist for lncRNA enrichment analysis. lncRNAlyzr is a webserver application designed for lncRNAs enrichment analysis. lncRNAlyzr has a database containing 33 lncRNA set libraries created by computing correlations between lncRNAs and annotated coding gene sets. After users submit a set of lncRNAs to lncRNAlyzr, the enrichment analysis results are visualized as ball-and-stick subnetworks where nodes are lncRNAs connected to enrichment terms from across selected lncRNA set libraries. To demonstrate lncRNAlyzr, it was used to analyze the effects of knocking down the lncRNA CYTOR in K562 cells. Overall, lncRNAlyzr is an enrichment analysis tool for lncRNAs aiming to further our understanding of lncRNAs functional modules. lncRNAlyzr is available from: https://lncrnalyzr.maayanlab.cloud. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic approach for relational exploration in cultural heritage knowledge graphs, exploiting Large Language Models (LLMs) for explanation generation and a mathematically grounded model to quantify the interestingness of relationships. We demonstrate the importance of the proposed interestingness measure through a quantitative analysis, highlighting its significant impact on system performance, particularly in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score. Utilizing the Wikidata Cultural Heritage Linked Open Data (WCH-LOD) dataset, our approach achieves a precision of 0.70, recall of 0.68, and an F1-score of 0.69, outperforming both graph-based (precision: 0.28, recall: 0.25, F1-score: 0.26) and knowledge-based (precision: 0.45, recall: 0.42, F1-score: 0.43) baselines. Furthermore, the proposed LLM-powered explanations exhibit better quality, as evidenced by higher BLEU (0.52), ROUGE-L (0.58), and METEOR (0.63) scores compared to baseline approaches. We further demonstrate a strong correlation (0.65) between the interestingness measure and the quality of generated explanations, validating its ability to guide the system towards more relevant discoveries. This system offers more effective exploration by achieving more diverse and human-interpretable relationship explanations compared to purely knowledge-based and graph-based methods, contributing to the knowledge-based systems field by providing a personalized and adaptable relational exploration framework. © 2025 by the author.

AB  - Digitized archival collections offer rich sources for cultural heritage research. Current systems, though, fail to effectively integrate heterogeneous data forms like images, textual descriptions, and metadata. This study offers a sophisticated framework that blends image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and knowledge graph methods to facilitate access, enable discovery, and reveal concealed historical patterns. The system comprises several modules such as a data input module, preprocessing pipeline, image recognition, NLP analysis, knowledge graph generation, semantic search engine, and an interactive user interface. Testing the system on a large historical archive dataset proved high accuracy, efficiency, and usability for all modules. Major takeaways are 93.4% accuracy in object detection for images, 94.8% accuracy for named entity recognition, and 95.5% search accuracy in semantic search feature.  © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - Conversational agents in art exhibitions can enhance user engagement and understanding of artworks by providing contextual information, especially through voice interactions. However, creating a deeper personal connection with art - which often requires direct aesthetic and visual experiences - remains a challenge. This paper examines how integrating visual perception into conversational agents can enhance alignment with visitors' artistic interpretations, thereby fostering deeper engagement with interactive art exhibitions. We introduce a voice-based conversational agent enhanced with visual capabilities via a multimodal large language model (MLLM), allowing the agent to perceive, interpret and discuss artworks in real-time with visitors. The system utilizes a simplified Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, which collects voice inputs, retrieves relevant information from a domain knowledge graph, and uses the LLM to generate conversational responses, which are then converted into voice outputs. A user study with 36 participants, divided into two groups, was conducted to compare the enhanced system with a baseline system that lacked visual input. Our results show that the visually enhanced system significantly improved visitor engagement and perception. Content analysis of the conversational transcripts further revealed a wider range of conversational topics, deeper visitor perceptions, and the agent's ability to provide more nuanced, visually-related discussions.  © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - RDF-star has been proposed as an extension of RDF to make statements about statements. Libraries and graph stores have started adopting RDF-star, but the generation of RDF-star data remains largely unexplored. To allow generating RDF-star from heterogeneous data, RML-star was proposed as an extension of RML. However, no system has been developed so far that implements the RML-star specification. In this work, we present Morph-KGCstar, which extends the Morph-KGC materialization engine to generate RDF-star datasets. We validate Morph-KGCstar by running test cases derived from the N-Triples-star syntax tests and we apply it to two real-world use cases from the biomedical and open science domains. We compare the performance of our approach against other RDF-star generation methods (SPARQL-Anything), showing that Morph-KGCstar scales better for large input datasets, but it is slower when processing multiple smaller files. © © 2024 – The authors.

AB  - This study investigates the evolution and current status of subject librarianship in Chinese higher education spanning the past 25 years. Utilizing scientometric analysis, we construct knowledge graphs, encompassing publication trends, co-citation and co-occurrence networks, and the burstiness of keywords. The data are drawn from 504 articles in the Chinese Social Science Citation Index (CSSCI) database. The analysis sheds light on knowledge domains, evolutionary routes, and research hotspots within this field. The graphs delineate intricate connections among subject librarianship in Chinese higher education, involving universities, faculties, students, cooperative enterprises, and government. Significantly, these services play pivotal roles in information resource construction, scientific research, intellectual property support, and propaganda. The progression of subject librarianship in Chinese higher education is driven by innovations in information technology, user demands and policy advocacy. The knowledge graph-based exploration of subject librarianship holds substantial implications for libraries further constructions, particularly in enriching content and enhancing quality, aligning with the criteria of the new education public policy outlined by the Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - [Purpose/ significance] In the context of an increasingly intense power game, it is crucial to comprehensively utilize intelligent means such as artificial intelligence and big data to perceive, integrate, and analyze critical intelligence from intricate information. [Method/ process] The unified cognitive engine system for defense technology intelligence integrates descriptive information from various intelligence perspectives to explore the construction of a multidimensional label ontology. Focusing on intelligence features, the representation and extraction of intelligence knowledge has been intensively studied. The fusion and disambiguation of intellectual element knowledge is achieved by leveraging the contrastive learning principle. An extensive knowledge graph for the defense technology intelligence field is automatically generated using techniques such as ontology modeling, entity relation extraction, and semantic alignment. Knowledge perception capabilities of large language models are supported by collaborative knowledge graphs. The generation capacity of lightweight large-scale intelligence topic reports is optimized through retrieval-enhanced generation techniques. [Result/ conclusion] Building upon the intelligence database, a national defense science and technology intelligence resource library has been established. The unified cognitive engine system offers functionalities including intelligence element extraction, intelligence knowledge tracing, and intelligence thematic report generation, facilitating the achievement of “intelligent perception and decision-making support” within the broader context. © 2025 Information studies: Theory and Application.

AB  - In the face of the urgent need to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) globally, this study focuses on park city construction in China. Firstly, it elaborates on the research background, emphasizing the significance of cities in SDG implementation and the role of park city construction as an innovative practice. The study is based on standardization providing technical support, the "Indicator Library for Cities’ Sustainable Development ((ILCSD)" as a practical tool, and the knowledge graph for intelligent decision-making. Through a scientific research technical route, including policy review, connotation analysis, indicator optimization, characteristic supplementation, data verification, and maturity stage division, it constructs an evaluation indicator system for park city sustainability. The system is closely related to multiple SDGs such as poverty reduction, hunger elimination, health promotion, and ecological protection. Empirical analysis in Beijing and Chengdu shows that Beijing excels in ecological space and green transportation, while Chengdu performs well in ecological value transformation and emerging economy. Finally, suggestions are put forward from cities' planning, policy guarantee, and indicator application aspects to promote park city construction and SDGs implementation, providing scientific evaluation and practical guidance for Chinese cities and contributing to global sustainable development. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

AB  - Graph Neural Networks have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in various graph-based tasks, but their inefficiency in training and inference poses significant challenges for scaling to real-world, large-scale applications. To address these challenges, a plethora of algorithms have been developed to accelerate GNN training and inference, garnering substantial interest from the research community. This paper presents a systematic review of these acceleration algorithms, categorizing them into three main topics: training acceleration, inference acceleration, and execution acceleration. For training acceleration, we discuss techniques like graph sampling and GNN simplification. In inference acceleration, we focus on knowledge distillation, GNN quantization, and GNN pruning. For execution acceleration, we explore GNN binarization and graph condensation. Additionally, we review several libraries related to GNN acceleration, including our Scalable Graph Learning library, and propose future research directions. © 1989-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The BookSampo Linked Data portal was deployed in 2011 by the Finnish Public Libraries and has today nearly 2 million annual users. Its Linked Data covers virtually all Finnish fiction literature but the data has not been used for data analyses in Digital Humanities. This paper discusses how the Knowledge Graph can be used for literary research in two ways: First, a new BookSampo 2.0 Portal user interface is presented, based on faceted semantic search with seamlessly integrated data-analytic tools for Digital Humanities research as suggested in the Sampo Model. This application makes it possible to analyze the data without programming skills. Second, the BookSampo SPARQL endpoint API can be accessed directly by SPARQL querying and scripting, using tools such as Jupyter Notebooks. The analysis results presented suggest interesting spatial, temporal, and topical trends in how the Finnish fiction literature has evolved during the last decades. The approach and tools presented in this paper can be used for analyzing literary landscapes developments in other countries as well. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - • What is already known on this topic–NLP can accurately detect polyp mentions in colonoscopy reports; however, no systematic review has yet been performed across clinical gastroenterology and hepatology. • What this study adds–An overview of NLP applied to gastroenterology up to 2023 highlighting areas of current strength and opportunities for future focus in the age of the large-language model. • How this study might affect research, practice, or policy—This study helps inform future priorities for NLP research in Gastroenterology and Hepatology while focusing on increased transparency and bias reduction within the field © Crown 2025.; Objective: This review assesses the progress of NLP in gastroenterology to date, grades the robustness of the methodology, exposes the field to a new generation of authors, and highlights opportunities for future research. Design: Seven scholarly databases (ACM Digital Library, Arxiv, Embase, IEEE Explore, Pubmed, Scopus and Google Scholar) were searched for studies published between 2015 and 2023 that met the inclusion criteria. Studies lacking a description of appropriate validation or NLP methods were excluded, as were studies ufinavailable in English, those focused on non-gastrointestinal diseases and those that were duplicates. Two independent reviewers extracted study information, clinical/algorithm details, and relevant outcome data. Methodological quality and bias risks were appraised using a checklist of quality indicators for NLP studies. Results: Fifty-three studies were identified utilising NLP in endoscopy, inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, liver and pancreatic disease. Colonoscopy was the focus of 21 (38.9%) studies; 13 (24.1%) focused on liver disease, 7 (13.0%) on inflammatory bowel disease, 4 (7.4%) on gastroscopy, 4 (7.4%) on pancreatic disease and 2 (3.7%) on endoscopic sedation/ERCP and gastrointestinal bleeding. Only 30 (56.6%) of the studies reported patient demographics, and only 13 (24.5%) had a low risk of validation bias. Thirty-five (66%) studies mentioned generalisability, but only 5 (9.4%) mentioned explainability or shared code/models. Conclusion: NLP can unlock substantial clinical information from free-text notes stored in EPRs and is already being used, particularly to interpret colonoscopy and radiology reports. However, the models we have thus far lack transparency, leading to duplication, bias, and doubts about generalisability. Therefore, greater clinical engagement, collaboration, and open sharing of appropriate datasets and code are needed. © Crown 2025.

AB  - In recent years, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been considered pyramids of interconnected data enriched with semantics for complex decision-making. The potential of KGs and the demand for interpretability of machine learning (ML) models in diverse domains (e.g., healthcare) have gained more attention. The lack of model transparency negatively impacts the understanding and, in consequence, interpretability of the predictions made by a model. Data-driven models should be empowered with the knowledge required to trace down their decisions and the transformations made to the input data to increase model transparency. In this paper, we propose InterpretME, a tool that using KGs, provides fine-grained representations of trained ML models. An ML model description includes data – (e.g., features’ definition and SHACL validation) and model-based characteristics (e.g., relevant features and interpretations of prediction probabilities and model decisions). InterpretME allows for defining a model’s features over data collected in various formats, e.g., RDF KGs, CSV, and JSON. InterpretME relies on the SHACL schema to validate integrity constraints over the input data. InterpretME traces the steps of data collection, curation, integration, and prediction; it documents the collected metadata in the InterpretME KG. InterpretME is published in GitHub and Zenodo. The InterpretME framework includes a pipeline for enhancing the interpretability of ML models, the InterpretME KG, and an ontology to describe the main characteristics of trained ML models; a PyPI library of InterpretME is also provided. Additionally, a live code, and a video demonstrating InterpretME in several use cases are also available. © © 2024 – The authors. Published by IOS Press.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive study of the application of AI-driven inpainting techniques to the restoration of historical photographs of the Czech city Most, with a focus on restoration and reconstructing the lost architectural heritage. The project combines state-of-the-art methods, including generative adversarial networks (GANs), patch-based inpainting, and manual retouching, to restore and enhance severely degraded images. The reconstructed/restored photographs of the city Most offer an invaluable visual representation of a city that was largely destroyed for industrial purposes in the 20th century. Through a series of blind and informed user tests, we assess the subjective quality of the restored images and examine how knowledge of edited areas influences user perception. Additionally, this study addresses the technical challenges of inpainting, including computational demands, interpretability, and bias in AI models. Ethical considerations, particularly regarding historical authenticity and speculative reconstruction, are also discussed. The findings demonstrate that AI techniques can significantly contribute to the preservation of cultural heritage, but must be applied with careful oversight to maintain transparency and cultural integrity. Future work will focus on improving the interpretability and efficiency of these methods, while ensuring that reconstructions remain historically and culturally sensitive. © 2024 by the author.

AB  - The traditional record-based approach to the description of Cultural Heritage is nowadays obsolete. It is unable to properly handle complex descriptions and it cannot support advanced functions provided by Artificial Intelligence techniques for helping practitioners, scholars, researchers and end-users in carrying out their tasks. A graph-based, semantic approach is needed, such as that provided by Semantic Web solutions. Also, a ‘holistic’ description approach is needed, that includes and inter-connects all branches and types of Cultural Heritage, and that is not limited to describing just the formal metadata of cultural objects, but can deal with their content, physicality, context and lifecycle, as well. The GraphBRAIN framework and technology for Knowledge Graph management enforces all these ideas and enjoys improved efficiency, expressiveness, and flexibility thanks to the use of the LPG model for knowledge representation. This paper describes GraphBRAIN and its application to several Cultural Heritage-related fields, including digital libraries, archives and museums, history of computing, and tourism as a way to boost fruition of these items. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Pretrained language models (PLMs) like BERT and GPT4 have become the foundation for modern information retrieval (IR) systems. However, existing PLM-based IR models primarily rely on the knowledge learned during training for prediction, limiting their ability to access and incorporate external, up-to-date or domain-specific information. Therefore, current information retrieval systems struggle with semantic nuances, context relevance, and domain-specific issues. To address these issues, we propose the second Knowledge-Enhanced Information Retrieval workshop (KEIR @ ECIR 2025) as a platform to discuss innovative approaches that integrate external knowledge, aiming to enhance the effectiveness of information retrieval in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from academia and industry to discuss various aspects of knowledge-enhanced information retrieval. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - This research paper presents HILDEGARD, an application conceived to guide a semi-expert user in the domain of cultural heritage data management toward the creation of a lightweight knowledge graph tailored for supporting Automatic Story Generation (ASG). For this purpose, a subset of CIDOC-CRM classes and properties is preliminarily selected to fit the domain of interest. The input is constituted by one or more seed-heritage objects selected from a knowledge base. In our case study, they are SPARQL-queried from a Linked Open Database for Italian Cultural Heritage. The shortest path algorithm is then run online on all couplets obtained by a combination of the Wikipedia entities from the selected entry-seeds descriptions. The retrieved entities are subsequently linked to their related DBpedia- or YAGO-entry in the chosen language, and the relationships among them are automatically retrieved. The proposed tool addresses different knowledge gaps and societal needs simultaneously, such as the lack of solutions tailored for narrative purposes in the cultural heritage domain, that is, to be used in a scenario where objects belonging to the same room must be linked through a narrative, which shall not only be coherent and informative but also engaging and interesting. The prototype, already able to generate the triples required for the following step of the proposed general ASG pipeline, is intended to be graphically enhanced so that the end user may guide the graph expansion interactively. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the performance of deep learning (DL) in diagnosing glaucoma and predicting its progression using fundus photography and retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Materials and Methods: Relevant studies published up to 30 October 2024 were retrieved from PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ClinicalKey. A bivariate random-effects model was employed to calculate pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results: A total of 48 studies were included in the meta-analysis. DL algorithms demonstrated high diagnostic performance in glaucoma detection using fundus photography and OCT images. For fundus photography, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89–0.94) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.90–0.95), respectively, with an AUROC of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.88–0.92). For the OCT imaging, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.90 (95% CI: 0.84–0.94) and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.81–0.91), respectively, with an AUROC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.83–0.90). In predicting glaucoma progression, DL models generally showed less robust performance, with pooled sensitivities and specificities ranging lower than in diagnostic tasks. Internal validation datasets showed higher accuracy than external validation datasets. Conclusions: DL algorithms achieve excellent performance in diagnosing glaucoma using fundus photography and OCT imaging. To enhance the prediction of glaucoma progression, future DL models should integrate multimodal data, including functional assessments, such as visual field measurements, and undergo extensive validation in real-world clinical settings. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - This study explores the digital transmission and protection of Hunan Flower-Drum Opera, a key intangible cultural heritage asset, through action semantic analysis combined with deep learning approaches. The research establishes a multimodal acquisition setup, develops an enriched Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network with an attention mechanism, creates a traditional Chinese opera-oriented semantic classification system, and constructs a digital heritage platform with an integrated knowledge graph. The proposed approach achieves a 92.6% action recognition rate and an 88.3% consistency rate in semantic analysis, showing a 17.5% improvement over traditional models. The 33-point BlazePose architecture achieves sub-millimeter accuracy in movement tracking, while the knowledge graph contains 3,427 nodes with 12,856 weighted edges. The interactive learning environment demonstrates significant improvement in learning outcomes with a 31% reduction in learning time while preserving cultural authenticity. The system has been successfully implemented at three centers specializing in Flower-Drum Opera transmission, offering a unique solution for the digital conservation of traditional Chinese performing arts. © 2025 Learning Gate.

AB  - We introduce EmoAtlas, a computational library/framework extracting emotions and syntactic/semantic word associations from texts. EmoAtlas combines interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) for syntactic parsing in 18 languages and psychologically validated lexicons for detecting the eight emotions in Plutchik’s theory. We show that EmoAtlas can match or surpass transformer-based natural language processing techniques, BERT or large language models like ChatGPT 3.5 or LLaMAntino, in detecting emotions from Italian and English online posts and news articles (e.g., achieving 85.6% accuracy in detecting anger in posts vs the 68.8% value of ChatGPT and 89.9% value for BERT). EmoAtlas presents important advantages in terms of speed and absence of fine-tuning, e.g., it runs 12x faster than BERT on the same data. Testing EmoAtlas’ and easily trainable transformers’ relevance in a psychometric task like reproducing human creativity ratings for 1071 short texts, we find that EmoAtlas and BERT obtain equivalent predictive power (fourfold cross-validation, ρ≈0.495, p<10-4). Combining BERT’s semantic features with EmoAtlas’ emotional/syntactic networks of words gets substantially better at estimating creativity rates of stories (ρ=0.628, p<10-4). This indicates an interplay between the creativity of narratives and their semantic, emotional, and syntactic structure. Via interpretable emotional profiles and syntactic networks, EmoAtlas can also quantify how emotions are channeled through specific words in texts, e.g., how did customers frame their ideas and emotions towards ”beds” in hotel reviews? We release EmoAtlas as a standalone ”text as data” computational tool and discuss its impact in extracting interpretable and reproducible insights from texts. © The Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2025.

AB  - In today's big data environment, the demand for digital transformation of traditional libraries is becoming more and more urgent. The article adopts BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model to extract digital library resources and retrograde entities, and constructs digital library resources knowledge graph. On the basis of digital library resources integration, it combines the collaborative filtering algorithm based on users and items to construct and improve the intelligent recommendation mechanism of digital book resources. The integration results of digital library resources and intelligent recommendation results are analyzed separately, and a survey on reader satisfaction is conducted. The recognition accuracy of this paper's method is significantly higher than that of the traditional text-like processing data model. The collaborative filtering algorithm in this paper provides statistical analysis of the types of book resources read by each reader, and recommends the top 5 book types in terms of similarity to him/her. This paper's method has better results in book resource division and book resource recommendation accuracy compared to other recommendation methods. The average value of readers' satisfaction with the resource recommendation mechanism of the digital library in S city for each dimension and each index is more than 4 points. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - With rapid development Virtual Reality VR and Augmented Reality AR technologies have witnessed their increasingly wide academic research and applications in the field of clothing. However from the content of previous studies few scholars have focused on the differences in research hotspots in this field at home and abroad. In terms of methods subjective content interpretation was mainly adopted while scientific measurement tools were rarely used in objective analysis. Given this to conduct a more comprehensive comparative analysis of the research hotspots and the development process of AR∕VR technology in the field of clothing at home and abroad this paper chooses CiteSpace a bibliometric software widely recognized in the academic circle as a research tool for visual comparative analysis of the research hotspots of AR∕VR technology in the field of clothing at home and abroad since the 21st century objectively presenting the similarities and differences frontiers and development process of research hotspots and providing new ideas and methods for the research of domestic virtual clothing. The Chinese data of the knowledge graph in this paper are sourced from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure CNKI database and the English data are sourced from the Web of Science core collection database. The Chinese and English databases are searched with Virtual Reality Augmented Reality and Clothing as the main subject terms. The time limit for both Chinese and English data is from 2001 to 2024. To improve the accuracy and scientificity of the data the literature types are further manually selected as papers and invalid literature with low relevance to the research topic such as design works conference papers and reviews is removed. After another precise search 265 Chinese papers and 240 English papers are obtained. The keyword co-occurrence and clustering algorithms of CiteSpace are used to analyze the research hotspot topics of VR∕AR technology in the clothing field at home and abroad since the 21st century 2001—2024 . At the same time the burstness detection timeline views of CiteSpace software combined with factors such as national policies and market trends are used to analyze the development context and future trends of AR∕VR technology in the clothing field at home and abroad. The results show that the research hotspots of AR∕VR technology in the field of clothing at home and abroad present multi-dimensional characteristics. In China the research hotspots mainly lie in the theoretical studies of basic theories and connotations of AR∕VR the display and application of virtual clothing and the digital restoration of historical clothing cultural heritage while in foreign countries more attention has been paid to the deep learning and system architecture and the upgrade of computer and image processing technologies. From the perspective of the development process the research in this field at home and abroad both reflects phased characteristics. In the initial exploration phase 2001—2009 researchers at home and abroad mainly focused on the optimization and upgrading of virtual clothing production technologies such as the modelling of human bodies and clothing. With the development of technology and changes in market demand in the development and market application phase 2010—2019 domestic research began to focus on the combination of technology and market application such as somatosensory interaction and clothing marketing while foreign research was more dedicated to the upgrade and expansion of virtual try-on technologies. Since 2020 in the phase of intelligent technology integration and application expansion the research hotspots in this field at home and abroad have been further diversified covering multiple fields such as business cultural inheritance and social value while integrating the application of deep learning and artificial intelligence technologies. Facing the new situation of technological progress digital and intelligent upgrades are urgently needed for the R&D design and manufacturing production systems of the textile and clothing industry. In the future integrating emerging technologies and intelligent applications to promote its sustainable development and digital and intelligent transformation will be the development direction of the clothing field in China. © 2025 China Silk Association.

AB  - The assessment of structural safety and a thorough understanding of buildings' structural behavior are critical to enhancing the resilience of the built environment. Cultural Heritage (CH) buildings present unique diagnosis challenges due to their diverse designs and construction techniques, often requiring attention during maintenance or disaster relief efforts. However, collaboration across CH and Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) fields is hindered by increasing information complexity and prolonged feedback loops. This paper introduces a methodological approach utilizing Knowledge Graph technologies to integrate structural diagnosis information and processes. The approach is applied to the diagnosis of the Notre-Dame de Paris buttressing system, demonstrated through a proof-of-concept knowledge system. By leveraging Knowledge Graph functionalities, insights are derived from the spatialization and provenance of mechanical phenomena, including observed or simulation-predicted cracks in mortar-bound masonry. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - The growing demand for Cultural Heritage fruition is making it a major economic driver, also in connection with its tourism-related aspects. The current solutions available on the Web are still unable to provide satisfactory support to the various kinds of stakeholders and to the different applications. The History of Computing, as a peculiar, relevant and currently underinvestigated branch of Cultural Heritage, raises additional challenges and provides new opportunities, also in connection with a significant economic flow it generates. The variety and complexity of issues connected to this domain call for even more advanced solutions. In this paper we introduce the CHIPS&BITS project, which tackles these problems using a knowledge-based approach and leverages a novel framework that can meet the needs associated to this specific domain in a better way compared to standard Semantic Web approaches. We describe the contributions of the project to overcome the limitations of the state of the art, and focus on some of its more peculiar and original features, among which the definition of suitable ontologies to describe the complexity of the domain and the use of Artificial Intelligence algorithms for giving the users an advanced and personalized experience. © 2025 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Insider threat attacks occur when individuals misuse their access to an organization's systems, data, or networks. These attacks, including Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), Pivoting, and Lateral Movement, often involve prolonged timelines and similar sensitive actions. Given the complexity of these attacks, current internal threat detection methods have their shortcomings. Firstly, internal threat attacks typically involve multiple sequences of malicious operations, making it challenging to capture the entire attack process using a single model. Secondly, current research often overlooks the interconnections between user behavior sequences, failing to differentiate between malicious intentions, actions, and outcomes. This neglect may lead to forensic inaccuracies and the misattribution of benign activities as attacks, potentially causing erroneous responses. Furthermore, existing internal threat detection methods fail to mine relevant attack evidence from known sensitive behaviors to thoroughly analyze the attack mechanisms. To address these challenges, we propose Ripple2Detect, a multi-step evidence detection framework for insider threat detection. First, Ripple2Detect builds an evidence sequence library by decomposing known attack behaviors into sequences and constructing a knowledge graph to measure their correlations. Next, we train a semantic similarity model based on the BERT architecture, tailored for operation sequences, to improve the detection of attack evidence. To overcome data imbalance, we introduce a contrastive learning loss to better distinguish between attack and non-attack behaviors. Finally, a preference propagation mechanism is used to predict attack behaviors within the knowledge graph. We conduct experiments on Cert-r4.2 and Cert-r5.2 benchmark datasets, comparing our model with state-of-the-art approaches. The results suggest that our model can identify malicious sequences with 0.96 F1 score and achieve an attack identification F1 score of up to 0.99.

AB  - This paper describes a methodological process for converting primary and secondary sources into a knowledge graph centered on the U.S. avant-garde movement Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.). Data was sourced from documents from the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation Archives, a published bibliography by E.A.T. co-founder Billy Klüver, and edge-notched cards from the Getty Research Institute. Processed with custom tools, allowing for semantic encoding of statements through “painting triples”, the data is stored in and accessible through a Wikibase knowledgebase. This approach aims to reduce barriers to creating knowledge graphs and expand reuse opportunities for research, applications, and data integration in cultural heritage contexts. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - As part of our ongoing work on rich structures for representing complex knowledge, we explored qualitative descriptions of systems composed of interacting flows. Here, we consider the issues in developing low-level descriptions of flows, such as by specifying constraints for transitions, and coordinating entities at different levels of granularity. Based on this example, we propose a unified flow model framework. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.

AB  - Digital libraries that maintain extensive textual collections may want to further enrich their content for certain downstream applications, e.g., building knowledge graphs, semantic enrichment of documents, or implementing novel access paths. All of these applications require some text processing, either to identify relevant entities, extract semantic relationships between them, or to classify documents into some categories. However, implementing reliable, supervised workflows can become quite challenging for a digital library because suitable training data must be crafted, and reliable models must be trained. While many works focus on achieving the highest accuracy on some benchmarks, we tackle the problem from a digital library practitioner. In other words, we also consider tradeoffs between accuracy and application costs, dive into training data generation through distant supervision and large language models such as ChatGPT, LLama, and Olmo, and discuss how to design final pipelines. Therefore, we focus on relation extraction and text classification, using the showcase of eight biomedical benchmarks .  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - This chapter discusses an underutilised resource in arts educational institutions that have a significant history: their archival collections, including the personal archives of famous artists and musicians who taught at the institution, were trained there, or were otherwise associated with the institution. The kinds of knowledge, insights and narratives that can be derived from such archival collections are examined. The authors propose knowledge graph as a suitable knowledge organisation scheme for representing items in the personal archives and their inter-relationships as well as links to concepts and resources on the Web. Three approaches to developing a knowledge graph are illustrated using the personal archive of two pioneer musicians and composers in post-World War II Singapore as case studies: Zubir Said and Leong Yoon Pin. A digital archive system comprising a graph database management system for storing the knowledge graph, and a graph visualisation interface for presenting the knowledge graph was developed. The initial results of a user study of the system and interface are described. The authors suggest that it is important for arts professionals to understand the development of their art in the locale in which they are practising, and to consider how their artistic practice can draw from the artistic heritage of the community. They refer to this kind of learning as a pedagogy of artistic tradition and heritage. © The Author(s) 2025. All rights reserved.

AB  - GluN3A-containing NMDA receptors have recently emerged as promising therapeutic targets for neurological disorders. However, discovering potent modulators remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the limitations of traditional high-throughput screening methods. In this study, we introduce a novel drug-target affinity prediction method, CLG-DTA, designed to enhance drug discovery for the GluN1/GluN3A receptor. This graph contrastive learning-based method incorporates natural language supervision by transforming regression labels into textual representation, and integrating them with traditional affinity data to enhance molecular representation. Additionally, a numerical knowledge graph is employed to refine continuous text embeddings, enabling precise modeling of complex drug-target interactions across diverse data modalities. Using CLG-DTA, we screened a library of 18 million compounds and identified 12 candidates for experimental validation. Among them, five compounds exhibited significant activity, with Boeravinone E demonstrating the highest potency (IC50 = 3.40 ± 0.91 μM). These findings highlight the potential of CLG-DTA in accelerating the identification of promising GluN1/GluN3A modulators and lay a robust foundation for future therapeutic development. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Pharmacological Society 2025.

AB  - Digital libraries in public administration often struggle with complex, paper-based bureaucratic procedures for certificate requests. This study presents a semantic digital library approach that leverages knowledge graphs to simplify and automate these processes. The research, conducted as part of an exploratory project for the Department of Public Function [1], demonstrates how semantic technologies can transform traditional document management in Public Administration (PA) [2]. The semantic foundation of our digital library is built upon a custom ontology [3] that defines a comprehensive taxonomy of certificates, required documents, and their relationships within the public administration domain. Our research shows that this semantic digital library approach is not only easily adoptable but also naturally extensible, offering a promising direction for modernizing public service delivery and reducing paper-based workflows. The implementation follows the Resource Description Framework (RDF) model, organizing the digital library's resources through subject-predicate-object triples. This semantic structure enables rich relationships between digital resources and facilitates intuitive navigation through certificate-related data and documents based on their semantic connections. Looking ahead, this semantic digital library framework has the potential to evolve into a Linked Open Data (LOD) ecosystem [4], enabling seamless information exchange between different public administration entities. This evolution would create an interconnected network of digital libraries, further streamlining certificate request procedures and document validation processes. © 2025 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The FAIR Photos project enriched the metadata of the Press Agency De Boer collection, comprising two million press photos (1945–2005) from the North Holland Archives in The Netherlands. By linking photographs to external datasets such as Wikidata, and creating thesauri in the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) – interlinked with external thesauri such as the Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) – the project significantly improved the collection’s accessibility for research and cultural heritage purposes. The enriched metadata, published in CSV and RDF formats, are available as open data in the DANS Data Station Social Sciences and Humanities (https://doi.org/10.17026/SS/7VD3ME). Funded by CLARIAH, the project promoted the FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) and Linked Open Data (LOD) adoption within the archive. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - While the useful armory of antibiotic drugs is continually depleted due to the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens, the development of novel therapeutics has also slowed down. In the era of advanced computational methods, approaches like machine learning (ML) could be one potential solution to help reduce the high costs and complexity of antibiotic drug discovery and attract collaboration across organizations. In our work, we developed a large antimicrobial knowledge graph (AntiMicrobial-KG) as a repository for collecting and visualizing public in vitro antibacterial assay. Utilizing this data, we build ML models to efficiently scan compound libraries to identify compounds with the potential to exhibit antimicrobial activity. Our strategy involved training seven classic ML models across six compound fingerprint representations, of which the Random Forest trained on the MHFP6 fingerprint outperformed, demonstrating an accuracy of 75.9% and Cohen’s Kappa score of 0.68. Finally, we illustrated the model’s applicability for predicting the antimicrobial properties of two small molecule screening libraries. First, the EU-OpenScreen library was tested against a panel of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and Fungal pathogens. Here, we unveiled that the model was able to correctly predict more than 30% of active compounds for Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and Fungal pathogens. Second, with the Enamine library, a commercially available HTS compound collection with claimed antibacterial properties, we predicted its antimicrobial activity and pathogen class specificity. These results may provide a means for accelerating research in AMR drug discovery efforts by carefully filtering out compounds from commercial libraries with lower chances of being active. © 2025 The Authors.

AB  - In this article, we focus on the task of exploiting the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate SPARQL Queries for answering natural questions over cultural Knowledge Graphs (KGs) expressed according to the ISO standard ontology CIDOC-CRM. Since CIDOC-CRM is an event-based model, usually we have to follow long paths for answering a question, thereby, the challenge is how to construct the prompt for aiding the LLM to produce the right SPARQL query. We propose and comparatively evaluate methods based on the creation of ontology path patterns of a configurable path radius (or length). Then, we construct a new dedicated benchmark that includes 100 natural questions and the corresponding SPARQL queries over two real KGs from the cultural domain describing artworks. Finally, we present comparative results about the effectiveness and efficiency over the benchmark by using ChatGPT-3.5. The most effective method follows a two-stage process that predicts and uses the most appropriate path patterns of r ≤ 4. This method achieves 3.5 higher accuracy than the baseline method (0.66 versus 0.19), that includes in the prompt only the list of properties and classes of the KG.  © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - This paper focuses on the task of survival time analysis for lung cancer. Despite significant progress in recent years, the performance of existing methods is still far from satisfactory. Traditional and some deep learning-based approaches for lung cancer survival time analysis primarily rely on textual clinical information such as staging, age, and histology, etc. Unlike these existing methods that predicting on the single modality, we observe that human clinicians usually consider multimodal data, such as textual clinical parameters and visual scans when estimating survival time. Motivated by this observation, we propose Lite-ProSENet, a smart cross-modality network for survival analysis that simulates human decision-making. Specifically, Lite-ProSENet adopts a two-tower architecture that takes the clinical parameters and the CT scans as inputs to produce survival prediction. The textural tower is responsible for modeling the clinical parameters. We build a light transformer using multi-head self-attention as our textural tower. The visual tower, ProSENet, is designed to extract features from CT scans. The backbone of ProSENet is a 3D ResNet that works together with several repeatable building blocks named 3D-SE Resblocks for compact feature extraction. Our 3D-SE Resblock is composed of a 3D channel “Squeeze-and-Excitation” (SE) block and a temporal SE block. The purpose of 3D-SE Resblock is to adaptively select valuable features from CT scans. Besides, to further filter out the redundant information in the CT scans, we developed a simple yet effective frame difference mechanism, which boost the performance of our model to achieve new state- of-the-art results. Extensive experiments were conducted using data from 422 NSCLC patients from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The results show that our Lite-ProSENet outperforms favorably against all comparison methods and achieves a new state-of-the-art concordance score of 89.3%.

AB  - Artificial intelligence and machine learning applications (AI/ML) provide unique opportunities for documentation, assessment and protection of world cultural heritage, at risk from natural disasters such as earthquakes, climate change, uncontrolled urbanization, etc. Some examples include the deep knowledge bases of churches/mosques damaged in the earthquakes in Italy in 2016, Mexico 2017, Morocco 2023 and Tukey/Syria 2023. Ontology development provides a unifying view of this data and is crucial for effectively applying deep learning techniques to document and manage heritage structures information. A well-designed ontology serves as a structured knowledge graph that facilitates data integration, search, and analysis. Key aspects of ontology development for heritage structure documentation include Ontology Design to ensure the ontology is generic enough to be applicable across diverse heritage assets, Integration of fragmented data from various sources enabling efficient data acquisition and storage, Deep Learning Applications employing the ontology to support deep learning algorithms for semantic segmentation of point cloud data, automated generation of heritage building information models (HBIM) among others, and Knowledge Completion, through models to predict missing information and enhance the quality of the knowledge graphs. Combining ontology development with deep learning techniques, improves heritage structure documentation significantly in terms of accessibility, interpretation, collaboration, and preservation. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Manufacturing process planning is the process of organizing the production steps based on product design. It aimed at determining the process routes and formulating resource allocation strategies in response to digital model. In the process of connecting product design and manufacturing, designers and manufacturing technicians focus on different aspects of the digital model. This leads to a distortion when manufacturing technicians transform the digital model information into process information. As a result, this results in a deviation in the mapping between design intent and process intent. Such deviations can lead to disconnections in the association of process knowledge, undermine the consistency and traceability between process documents and digital models. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-layer knowledge graph for manufacturing process planning(mKGMPP) and an interactive manufacturing process planning system (IMPP system) driven by digital model and the proposed knowledge framework. The historical process schemes are analyzed using a dual-dimensional approach based on text and digital model. An extraction strategy based on structured data parsing and intelligent agent processing is employed for textual knowledge extraction. For geometric feature knowledge, the OpenCV library is employed, along with Gaussian blur, morphological operations, and the Canny detection algorithm. The intra knowledge of process schemes is integrated using the 4M1E elements, and multi-dimensional relationships between process schemes are established based on TQCSE. The geometric similarity inference module, process scheme inference module, and processing content modification module have been developed, and an interactive interface has been built based on Gradio. A manufacturing process planning of a slender shaft in the aerospace domain validates the rationality of the proposed knowledge organization framework and knowledge inference method. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ontologies are widely used for representing domain knowledge and meta data, playing an increasingly important role in Information Systems, the Semantic Web, Bioinformatics and many other domains. However, logical reasoning that ontologies can directly support are quite limited in learning, approximation and prediction. One straightforward solution is to integrate statistical analysis and machine learning. To this end, automatically learning vector representation for knowledge of an ontology i.e., ontology embedding has been widely investigated. Numerous papers have been published on ontology embedding, but a lack of systematic reviews hinders researchers from gaining a comprehensive understanding of this field. To bridge this gap, we write this survey paper, which first introduces different kinds of semantics of ontologies and formally defines ontology embedding as well as its property of faithfulness. Based on this, it systematically categorizes and analyses a relatively complete set of over 80 papers, according to the ontologies they aim at and their technical solutions including geometric modeling, sequence modeling and graph propagation. This survey also introduces the applications of ontology embedding in ontology engineering, machine learning augmentation and life sciences, presents a new library mOWL and discusses the challenges and future directions. © 1989-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The study introduces a clinical decision support system (CDSS) developed at a single academic cancer center, integrating real-time clinical, genomic, and imaging data for over 170,000 patients across 11 cancer types. We have developed the Yonsei Cancer Data Library (YCDL) data integration framework to continuously collect and update multimodal datasets comprising over 800 features per case. Quality control measures, using 143 logical comparisons, addressed missing data and outliers, achieving median accuracies of 92.6% for surgical and 98.7% for molecular pathology. An Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process with natural language processing transformed unstructured data, enabling survival analyses stratified by tumor stage, which revealed significant stage-dependent differences. The CDSS dashboard visualizes patient trajectories and key milestones. User feedback from oncology professionals showed strong acceptance, with satisfaction scores exceeding 4 out of 5. This framework demonstrates the potential of multimodal data integration to enhance clinical decision-making and patient outcomes, with future research needed to validate its generalizability and scalability. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is revolutionizing the precision diagnosis and treatment system in digestive system malignancies. In the preoperative stage, deep learning-driven multimodal data can significantly enhance the accuracy of early lesion detection and organ function assessment, while optimizing the prediction of the efficacy neoadjuvant therapy response with radiomics features. During surgery, the automatic surgical phase alorithm and intelligent pathology testing can effectively coordinate the surgical process; the combination of AI with augmented reality navigation system (AR) and mixed reality technology (MR) can improve the accuracy of intraoperative navigation; enhances intraoperative navigation accuracy; and the autonomous surgical robots can improve their ability to perform key tasks during surgery using sophisticated motion control algorithms. In postoperative management, federated learning promotes secure cross-institutional data sharing and alleviates the problem of data silos; and the development of interpretable models can also provide clearer decision-making basis for complication prediction and prognosis management. However, the current clinical translation process still faces three core challenges: (1) Quality control problems: the dual constraints of insufficient model generalization ability and lack of unified evaluation standards; (2) Methodological challenges: the logical opacity of decision-making and the cognitive barriers of the algorithm's causal reasoning process still affect its credibility; (3) Ethical and legal vacuum: the attribution of medical responsibility is unclear, and the legal system has not yet fully adapted to the development of AI applications. Based on this, the future should focus on: (1) Developing transparent AI systems to achieve a paradigm shift from "black box prediction" to "white box deductions"; (2) Establishing systematic AI evaluation standards and ethical and legal regulatory frameworks; (3) Promoting the construction of specialized biorepositories database and causal graph library for digestive oncology. The aim is to help AI upgrade from an auxiliary tool to an intelligent decision-making partner. © 2025 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article explores the representation of geospatial knowledge within narratives through a Semantic Web approach. We introduce the NOntSpace (NOntS) model, an extension of the CIDOC CRM-based Narrative Ontology, which allows the representation of narratives and their geospatial aspects. By leveraging standards such as CRMgeo and GeoSPARQL, NOntS ensures systematic and interoperable geospatial representation in narratives, enabling geospatial queries on knowledge graphs. We present an assessment of NOntS utilizing data from the H2020 MOVING European project (2021-2024), which collected knowledge about European mountain value chains intended as Cultural Heritage. We have represented this knowledge as geospatial narratives using NOntS. GeoSPARQL queries and semantic reasoning applied to the created KG reveal the ontology ability to infer new geospatial knowledge. Our work contributes to the ongoing efforts in the Semantic Web community to integrate and represent geospatial information within narratives, promoting collaboration and interoperability across various scientific domains.  © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - This paper explores the unique challenges of artwork image captioning, a task that demands deep understanding of historical, cultural, and stylistic elements often absent in traditional image captioning. We conducted preliminary experiments using a Meshed Memory Transformer on the Iconclass AI Test Set, which revealed significant improvements in standard metrics but highlighted critical limitations in current datasets and evaluation methods. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach integrating knowledge graphs with large language models. This approach involves creating a specialized art ontology and knowledge graph, and developing new evaluation metrics specifically designed for artwork captioning. While not yet implemented, this proposed method aims to generate more comprehensive, contextually rich, and accurate captions for artwork images. Our research lays the groundwork for future advancements in artwork image captioning, potentially enhancing the accessibility and educational value of digital art collections.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Blocking aims to avoid unnecessary comparisons in a data matching pipeline. The heterogeneous nature of Knowledge Graphs (KG) is challenging for blocking approaches that traditionally were implemented for tabular data. While there is vast research on blocking approaches in general, the domain of KGs lacks systematic investigation, especially when comparing embedding-based and symbolic approaches. In this study, we generalize relational blocking, which incorporates neighborhood information of entities, to enable a variety of approaches across the neuro-symbolic spectrum. The results of our study are three-fold: (1) The relational enhancements to state-of-the-art approaches significantly improve their results. (2) (Neuro-)Symbolic approaches can outperform sophisticated deep-learning-based methods in terms of speed and quality. (3) Hybrid methods that combine symbolic and embedding-based techniques are promising avenues that have not been explored thoroughly yet. Our experiments were run on 16 real-world datasets of varying sizes with mono- and multi-lingual settings. We ensure statistical significance with a Bayesian analysis. We release our framework as open-source library. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Protecting cultural heritage buildings poses significant research challenges. Effective damage prevention hinges on a thorough understanding of structural behavior and the continuous monitoring of its changes over time. Advanced visualization tools are essential to provide adequate awareness of the monitoring systems installed over the years while guaranteeing a quick, basic analysis of their data. This paper addresses a crucial gap in structural health monitoring (SHM), particularly in managing complex structures and systems, by responding to the growing need for tools that not only represent 3D models enriched with heterogeneous data and metadata but also facilitate detailed analysis of sensor recordings. In response to this challenge, it proposes the integration of a 3D informational model and an interactive web-based platform for monitoring data, creating a comprehensive management tool. Piazza del Duomo UNESCO Site in Pisa serves as an ideal test case due to its historical significance, structural complexity, and the wealth of monitoring data collected over time. With their interactive architecture, the two developed integrated visualization tools that could offer an effective solution for data management and visualization in other heritage contexts, particularly in cases where the monitoring system consists of numerous sensors and has evolved substantially over the years. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Traditional ethnographic methods have long been employed to study craft practices, yet they often fall short of capturing the full depth of embodied knowledge, material interactions, and procedural workflows inherent in craftsmanship. This paper introduces a digitally enhanced ethnographic framework that integrates Motion Capture, 3D scanning, audiovisual documentation, and semantic knowledge representation to document both the tangible and dynamic aspects of craft processes. By distinguishing between endurant (tools, materials, objects) and perdurant (actions, events, transformations) entities, we propose a structured methodology for analyzing craft gestures, material behaviors, and production workflows. The study applies this proposed framework to eight European craft traditions—including glassblowing, tapestry weaving, woodcarving, porcelain pottery, marble carving, silversmithing, clay pottery, and textile weaving—demonstrating the adaptability of digital ethnographic tools across disciplines. Through a combination of multimodal data acquisition and expert-driven annotation, we present a comprehensive model for craft documentation that enhances the preservation, education, and analysis of artisanal knowledge. This research contributes to the ongoing evolution of ethnographic methods by bridging digital technology with Cultural Heritage studies, offering a robust framework for understanding the mechanics and meanings of craft practices. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Background and Objective: The paper addresses challenges in storing and retrieving sequences in contexts like anomaly detection, behavior prediction, and genetic information analysis. Associative Knowledge Graphs (AKGs) offer a promising approach by leveraging sparse graph structures to encode sequences. The objective was to develop a method for sequence storage and retrieval using AKGs that maintain high memory capacity and context-based retrieval accuracy while introducing algorithms for efficient element ordering. Methods: The study utilized Sequential Structural Associative Knowledge Graphs (SSAKGs). These graphs encode sequences as transitive tournaments with nodes representing objects and edges defining the order. Four ordering algorithms were developed and tested: Simple Sort, Node Ordering, Enhanced Node Ordering, and Weighted Edges Node Ordering. The evaluation was conducted on synthetic datasets consisting of random sequences of varying lengths and distributions, and real-world datasets, including sentence-based sequences from the NLTK library and miRNA sequences mapped symbolically with a window-based approach. Metrics such as precision, sensitivity, and specificity were employed to assess performance. Results: The Weighted Edges Node Ordering algorithm demonstrated superior precision and resilience to graph density. In real-world applications, sentence retrieval achieved precision rates of 94.7%–97.3% for contexts of 8–10 words, while miRNA sequence retrieval using a 6-nucleotide window reached 99.6% precision at longer contexts. SSAKGs exhibited quadratic growth in memory capacity relative to graph size. Conclusion: This study introduces a novel structural approach for sequence storage and retrieval. Key advantages include no training requirements, flexible context-based reconstruction, and high efficiency in sparse memory graphs. With broad applications in computational neuroscience and bioinformatics, the approach offers scalable solutions for sequence-based memory tasks. © 2025

AB  - Knowledge of Chinese traditional opera is primarily preserved in informal forms, such as ancient texts, cultural relics, and oral traditions. To appreciate the unique charm of traditional opera, we focus on Yu Opera as a case study and develop the Yu Opera Knowledge Resource (YOKR) Ontology. Our approach involves collecting data from specialized literature, semantically segmenting it, and using the Bert4torch model for entity and relationship extraction. This paper explores the connections among historical figures, roles, plays, music, costumes, and other elements, aiming to enrich knowledge in Yu Opera and provide effective knowledge management services.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Natural products (NP) have proven to be a rich source of potentially bioactive compounds, and metabolomics is the current method of choice for characterizing natural extracts. To integrate the vast amount of data and information produced by modern metabolomics workflows, we recently developed a sample-centric approach for the semantic enrichment and alignment of metabolomics datasets. The resulting Experimental Natural Products Knowledge Graph (ENPKG) is queryable and integrates both newly acquired digitalized experimental data and information, and previously reported knowledge. It allows the highlighting of putative bioactive compounds at the extract level by comparing, for example, the occurrence of compounds of a given chemical class with bioactivity results. Using this approach, we recently described potent anti-Trypanosoma cruzi activity of two rotenoids, deguelin and rotenone. These compounds were identified in six active extracts from four plant species: Cnestis palala (Connaraceae), Chadsia grevei, Pachyrhizus erosus, and Desmodium heterophylum (Fabaceae). In this work, we present the results of the phytochemical investigation of four of these extracts and the establishment of a library of structural analogs for in vitro bioactivity testing. This work led to the isolation, characterization, and biological evaluation of the anti-T. cruzi potential of 41 compounds, including 11 rotenoids and seven compounds reported for the first time. Thanks to modern metabolite annotation and single-step isolation procedures, this work also demonstrates the possibility of considering natural extract libraries as a reservoir of rapidly accessible pure NPs. This perspective could increase the options for NP research and help accelerate NP drug discovery efforts. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In recent years, the abundance of available scholarly information has requested constant development and revision of standardized models and shared guidelines. Based on these frameworks, the Digital Humanities (DH) landscape features a variety of aggregators expected to enhance research data findability while promoting use and reuse. However, current semantic models fail to capture the specificity of DH research products, hindering data discovery and hampering the valorisation of Cultural Heritage. The ATLAS project addresses these key challenges by developing a unified framework for describing and aggregating scholarly outputs, particularly in the Italian Digital Cultural Heritage domain. This paper presents the initial versions of the ATLAS Ontology and Knowledge Graph, designed to model DH outcomes such as Digital Scholarly Editions, text collections, Linked Open Data, ontologies, and software. In so doing, ATLAS aims to enhance resource findability and reuse, paving the way for improved interoperability and future advancements in the field. © 2025 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The preservation and innovation of traditional craftsmanship under industrialization pressures constitute critical challenges for cultural sustainability. Focusing on Chengdu lacquerware—a Chinese intangible cultural heritage facing multifaceted preservation dilemmas—this study develops a digital methodology for its systematic documentation and contemporary adaptation. Through computational analysis of 307 historical artifacts spanning four craftsmanship categories (carved silver mercer, carved lacquer hidden flower, carved filling, and broach needle carving), we established a three-phase digital preservation framework: (1) image preprocessing of 280 qualified samples using adaptive binarization and Canny edge detection for ornament extraction, (2) chromatic analysis via two-stage K-means clustering to decode traditional color schemes, and (3) creation of a digital repository encompassing color profiles and ornamental elements. The resource library facilitated three practical applications: modular recombination of high-frequency motifs, cross-media design adaptations, and interactive visualization of craftsmanship processes. Technical analysis confirmed that adaptive binarization effectively mitigated image noise compared to conventional methods, while secondary clustering enhanced color scheme representativeness. These advancements demonstrate that structured digital archiving coupled with computational analysis can reconcile traditional aesthetics with modern design requirements without compromising cultural authenticity. The workflow provides a transferable model for intangible heritage preservation, emphasizing rigorous documentation alongside adaptive reuse mechanisms. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - [Objectives] Traditional settlements contain rich geographical, cultural, and historical information, making them an essential component of cultural heritage. The urgent need to protect these resources highlights the importance of their preservation. Research in traditional settlements has generated vast, multimodal, and heterogeneous data resources. However, much of the textual information remains unstructured, limiting its potential for in-depth analysis and the exploration of embedded landscape gene information. There is currently a lack of principles and methods that combine data mining and natural language processing to extract cultural landscape genes information from extensive textual data on traditional settlements. This study introduces the concept of Traditional Settlement Landscape Genes Named Entity (TSLGNE) and applies it in recognition experiments using 48 traditional villages in Shaoyang, supported by the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF deep learning model. [Methods] First, the study explores the connotation, classification system, and knowledge representation of TSLGN by combining geographical entity characteristics with cultural landscape gene theory. Second, based on the TSLGNE classification system and an extended BIOES annotation method, the source text data from the study area is annotated to construct a corresponding corpus. Subsequently, the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model is utilized for TSLGNE identification and extraction. Finally, the obtained TSLGNE knowledge is organized and stored using a Neo4j graph database, enabling spatial feature analysis of traditional settlements and their associated TSLGNEs. [Results] The model achieves an overall F1-score of 64% for TSLGNE recognition, outperforming the BiLSTM-CRF and BERT-CRF models by 11% and 1%, respectively. Notably, the model significantly enhances recognition performance for entities with low-quality and semantically complex data, with the F1-score for cultural gene category C3 increasing by 31% and 5%, respectively, compared to the baseline models. [Conclusions] The proposed model efficiently extracts TSLGNE information such as architecture, environment, and culture from large-scale text. Additionally, it effectively analyzes the spatial characteristics and relationships of cultural genes within traditional settlements in complex regions. This study offers valuable insights into traditional Chinese settlements, combining GIS and spatial data mining methods to advance research on their key cultural characteristics. © 2025 Science Press.

AB  - The rising threat of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, underscores the urgent need for new therapeutic solutions to tackle the challenge of antibiotic resistance. The current study utilized an innovative 3R infection model featuring the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum infected with Mycobacterium marinum, serving as stand-ins for macrophages and M. tuberculosis, respectively. This high-throughput phenotypic assay allowed for the evaluation of more specific anti-infective activities that may be less prone to resistance mechanisms. To discover novel anti-infective compounds, a diverse collection of 1600 plant NEs from the Pierre Fabre Library was screened using the latter assay. Concurrently, these NEs underwent untargeted UHPLC-HRMS/MS analysis. The biological screening flagged the NE from Stauntonia brunoniana as one of the anti-infective hit NEs. High-resolution HPLC micro-fractionation coupled with bioactivity profiling was employed to highlight the natural products driving this bioactivity. Stilbenes were eventually identified as the primary active compounds in the bioactive fractions. A knowledge graph was then used to leverage the heterogeneous data integrated into it to make a rational selection of stilbene-rich NEs. Using both CANOPUS chemical classes and Jaccard similarity indices to compare features within the metabolome of the 1600 plant NEs collection, 14 NEs rich in stilbenes were retrieved. Among those, the roots of Gnetum edule were flagged as possessing broader chemo-diversity in their stilbene content, along with the corresponding NE also being a strict anti-infective. Eventually, a total of 11 stilbene oligomers were isolated from G. edule and fully characterized by NMR with their absolute stereochemistry established through electronic circular dichroism. Six of these compounds are new since they possess a stereochemistry which was never described in the literature to the best of our knowledge. All of them were assessed for their anti-infective activity and (−)-gnetuhainin M was reported as having the highest anti-infective activity with an IC50 of 22.22 μM. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Backgrounds: This study innovatively enhances personalized emotional responses and user experience quality in traditional Chinese folding armchair (Jiaoyi chair) design through an interdisciplinary methodology. Goal: To systematically extract user emotional characteristics, we developed a hybrid research framework integrating web-behavior data mining. Methods: 1) the KJ method combined with semantic crawlers extracts emotional descriptors from multi-source social data; 2) expert evaluation and fuzzy comprehensive assessment reduce feature dimensionality; 3) random forest and K-prototype clustering identify three core emotional preference factors: “Flexible Refinement,” “Uncompromising Quality,” and “ergonomic stability.” Discussion: A CNN-GRU-Attention hybrid deep learning model was constructed, incorporating dynamic convolutional kernels and gated residual connections to address feature degradation in long-term semantic sequences. Experimental validation demonstrated the superior performance of our model in three chair design preference prediction tasks (RMSE = 0.038953, 0.066123, 0.0069777), outperforming benchmarks (CNN, SVM, LSTM). Based on the top-ranked preference encoding, we designed a new Jiaoyi chair prototype, achieving significantly reduced prediction errors in final user testing (RMSE = 0.0034127, 0.0026915, 0.0035955). Conclusion: This research establishes a quantifiable intelligent design paradigm for modernizing cultural heritage through computational design. Copyright © 2025 Yang, Zhang and Lv.

AB  - In response to the growing diverse needs of the ceramic industry, this paper presents a creative approach employing the ErgoLAB human–machine environment synchronization platform to identify key parameters for ceramic shape parametric design. By collecting and analyzing multimodal data, including eye movements, electroencephalographic signals, and skin conductance, the study systematically determines the core factors influencing the user experience. Based on this, a Python (IronPython 2.7.9 (2.7.9.0) on NET 4.0.30319.42000 (64-bit))-based parametric design process is developed, covering parameter selection, shape generation, and model visualization. A model library of classic ceramic shapes is rapidly constructed, and ergonomic experiments further investigate the human–computer interaction mechanisms involved. The designs are optimized using fuzzy comprehensive evaluation for aesthetic appeal. Combined with 3D printing technology, a complete closed loop from design to manufacturing is achieved, verifying the manufacturability of the designs. This study not only deepens the understanding of ceramic shape parametric design but also offers strong support for the diverse development of the ceramic industry, providing valuable references for parametric design applications in other industrial fields. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - The European Union's ban on animal testing for cosmetic products and their ingredients, combined with the lack of validated animal-free methods, poses challenges in evaluating their potential repeated-dose organ toxicity. To address this, innovative strategies like Next-Generation Risk Assessment (NGRA) are being explored, integrating historical animal data with new mechanistic insights from non-animal New Approach Methodologies (NAMs). This paper introduces the TOXIN knowledge graph (TOXIN KG), a tool designed to retrieve toxicological information on cosmetic ingredients, with a focus on liver-related data. TOXIN KG uses graph-structured semantic technology and integrates toxicological data through ontologies, ensuring interoperable representation. The primary data source is safety information on cosmetic ingredients from scientific opinions issued by the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety between 2009 and 2019. The ToxRTool automates the reliability assessment of toxicity studies, while the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) notation standardizes chemical identification, enabling in silico prediction of repeated-dose toxicity via the implementation of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship Toolbox (OECD QSAR Toolbox). The ToXic Process Ontology, enriched with relevant biological repositories, is employed to represent toxicological concepts systematically. Search filters allow the identification of cosmetic compounds potentially linked to liver toxicity. Data visualization is achieved through Ontodia, a JavaScript library. TOXIN KG, filled with information for 88 cosmetic ingredients, allowed us to identify 53 compounds affecting at least one liver toxicity parameter in a 90-day repeated-dose animal study. For one compound, we illustrate how TOXIN KG links this observation to hepatic cholestasis as an adverse outcome. In an ab initio NGRA context, follow-up in vitro studies using human-based NAMs would be necessary to understand the compound's biological activity and the molecular mechanism leading to the adverse effect. In summary, TOXIN KG emerges as a valuable tool for advancing the reusability of cosmetics safety data, providing knowledge in support of NAM-based hazard and risk assessments.

AB  - The development process of knowledge services in smart libraries has undergone various stages, ranging from resource integration and digitization in the initial stage, to knowledge integration and initial aggregation in the developmental stage, then to semantic association and knowledge graph construction in the deepening stage, and finally to intelligent aggregation and personalized services in the innovative stage. Each stage demonstrates the continuous deepening and upgrading of knowledge services in smart libraries. The theory of knowledge aggregation and its application in the construction of smart libraries, including the concepts, characteristics, types, and methods of knowledge aggregation, provide theoretical support for the construction of smart libraries. This study elaborates on the implementation methods of multi-dimensional aggregation of library digital resources, including data preparation, clustering dimensions, and association dimensions, providing specific guidance for the effective integration and utilization of library resources. Finally, it looks ahead to the development trends of multi-source knowledge aggregation in smart libraries and proposes corresponding strategic suggestions to promote the sustainable development of smart libraries. © 2024 ACM.

AB  - To address the challenges posed by the vast and complex knowledge information in cultural heritage design, such as low knowledge retrieval efficiency and limited visualization, this study proposes a method for knowledge extraction and knowledge graph construction based on graph attention neural networks (GAT). Using Tang Dynasty gold and silver artifacts as samples, we establish a joint knowledge extraction model based on GAT. The model employs the BERT pretraining model to encode collected textual knowledge data, conducts sentence dependency analysis, and utilizes GAT to allocate weights among entities, thereby enhancing the identification of target entities and their relationships. Comparative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that this model significantly outperforms baseline models in extraction effectiveness. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the construction of a knowledge graph for Tang Dynasty gold and silver artifacts. Taking the Gilded Musician Pattern Silver Cup as an example, this method provides designers with a visualized and interconnected knowledge collection structure. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Objectives: Lung Cancer (LC) is a multifactorial disease for which the role of genetic susceptibility has become increasingly relevant. Our aim was to use artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze differences between patients with LC based on family history of cancer (FHC). Materials and methods: From August 2016 to June 2020 clinical information was obtained from Thoracic Tumors Registry (TTR), a nationwide database sponsored by the Spanish Lung Cancer Group. In addition to descriptive statistical analysis, an AI-assisted analysis was performed. The German Technical Information Library supported the merging of data from the electronic medical records and database of the TTR. The results of the AI-assisted analysis were reported using Knowledge Graph, Unified Schema and descriptive and predictive analyses. Results: Analyses were performed in two phases: first, conventional statistical analysis including 11,684 patients of those 5,806 had FHC. Median overall survival (OS) for the global population was 23 months (CI 95 %: 21.39–24.61) in patients with FHC versus 21 months (CI 95 %: 19.53–22.48) in patients without FHC (NFHC), p < 0.001. The second AI-assisted analysis included 5,788 patients of those 939 had FHC. 58.48 % of women with FHC had LC. 9.53 % of patients had an EGFR or HER2 mutation or ALK translocation and at least one relative with cancer. A family history of LC was associated with an increased risk of smoking-related LC. Non-smokers with a family history of LC were more likely to have an EGFR mutation in NSCLC. In Bayesian network analysis, 55 % of patients with a family history of LC and never-smokers had an EGFR mutation. Conclusion: In our population, the incidence of LC in patients with a FHC is higher in women and younger patients. FHC is a risk factor and predictor of LC development, especially in people ≤ 50 years. These results were confirmed by conventional statistics and AI-assisted analysis. © 2024

AB  - Ancient Chinese classics embody and transmit the intellectual heritage of China across generations. These texts, rich in enduring ideas, narratives, and insights, have been passed down through a lengthy historical process. While digital modeling of cultural heritage has advanced, research that integrates both the unique characteristics of these classics and their transmission processes remains limited. This study introduces ClaOnto, an ontology specifically designed for ancient Chinese classics. It captures the various versions of these texts and their interrelations, contents, related individuals, locations, periods, and languages. It also emphasizes the processes and evaluations involved in their transmission. This contributes to a more nuanced understanding and increased awareness of preserving ancient classics. ClaOnto comprises three modules: Basic Information, Transmission Information, and Evaluation Information. Its development involved adapting and enhancing existing mature ontologies, as well as designing new concepts and relationships to articulate the knowledge and intangible values transmitted through these classics across generations. Additionally, by employing methods such as data mining, text analysis, and data visualization, this study outlines a workflow for implementing this ontology-based knowledge graph, demonstrated using the Tao Te Ching as a case study. The methodological enhancement enriches the analysis of how the intangible value in classics manifests through transmission. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Traditional cultural heritage, often damaged or limited to static displays, struggles to fully convey its profound significance. The rapid advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Extended Reality (XR) technologies has introduced transformative solutions to the preservation, restoration, and interactive display of cultural heritage. IoT enables real-time data acquisition, multi-device connectivity, and dynamic interactions, while XR enhances cultural heritage engagement through immersive experiences and precise digital reconstructions. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the synergistic application of IoT and XR in cultural heritage, focusing on three key areas: 3D reconstruction and restoration, smart guidance, and immersive experiences. In 3D reconstruction and restoration, this review explores how IoT's efficient data acquisition and transmission capabilities integrate with XR's high-precision visualization techniques to improve accuracy and efficiency in heritage preservation. For Intelligent Guided Tour, this review analyzes how IoT-enabled device collaboration and real-time updates enhance XR-based personalized and interactive tour experiences. In immersive experiences, this review examines how IoT's multi-source data sensing combined with XR's multisensory interaction creates more engaging and participatory environments for users. The review also synthesizes existing user evaluation methodologies and identifies key challenges in the convergence of IoT and XR, including device compatibility, data transmission latency, cost, and privacy concerns. Future directions are proposed, such as advancing multimodal data processing, establishing open technical standards, and developing cost-effective solutions for broader adoption. This study highlights the immense potential of IoT and XR to revolutionize the preservation, understanding, and experience of cultural heritage, providing valuable insights for future research and applications.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The problem of constructing a knowledge graph for previously unprocessed scientific texts is studied. The task is to analyze the use of various machine processing methods for extracting text semantics using the example of an interdisciplinary subject area. The goal of the research is to create a semantic model of the subject area of an interdisciplinary scientific journal and use a knowledge graph to navigate through data. The semantic model is based on the ontology of the LibMeta library. Texts and metadata receive connections due to the processing procedure and become part of the ontology of the semantic library. The interdisciplinary subject area is integrated into the library content as a related area of the ‘‘mathematics’’ ontology of the LibMeta library. A comparison of texts is carried out according to different characteristics, thematic proximity, commonality of research methods and approaches, problem setting and their symbolic representation. The results of preliminary text processing and the results in the form of a knowledge graph integrated into the library content are presented. The formulation of the problem of constructing an ontology and a knowledge graph for an interdisciplinary subject area adjacent to mathematics is considered by the authors as part of the general problem of managing mathematical knowledge. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2024.

AB  - [ Purpose/Significance] In order to reveal the development path and characteristics of information science at home and abroad in a more comprehensive and detailed way, so as to help scholars have a deeper understanding of the development of the field from a more macro perspective. [ Method/Process ] This paper took the representative core journal papers in the field of information science at home and abroad as data sources, and adopted methods such as co-citation analysis, word frequency method and knowledge graph to visually present the research fronts and evolution trends in the field of information science at home and abroad. [ Results/Conclusion] Firstly, the comparison reveals that there are both similarities and differences in the research front topics of information science at home and abroad. Secondly, the classical research front evolution path in the field of domestic information science include the evolution path focusing on library information service and the evolution path focusing on metrology and information visualization, while the classic research front evo-lution path in foreign countries is the evolution path focusing on user perception and user behavior. The fundamental reason for the difference in the performance of typical research front evolution paths at home and abroad lies in the different origins, development backgrounds and research paradigms of information science at home and abroad. © 2024 Editorial Board of Journal of Modern Information.

AB  - In the Islamic domain, Hadiths hold significant importance, standing as crucial texts following the Holy Quran. Each Hadith contains three main parts: the ISNAD (chain of narrators), TARAF (starting part, often from Prophet Muhammad), and MATN (Hadith content). ISNAD, a chain of narrators involved in transmitting that particular MATN. Hadith scholars determine the trustworthiness of the transmitted MATN by the quality of the ISNAD. The ISNAD's data is available in its original Arabic language, with narrator names transliterated into English. This paper presents the Multi-IsnadSet (MIS), that has great potential to be employed by the social scientist and theologist. A multi-directed graph structure is used to represents the complex interactions among the narrators of Hadith. The MIS dataset represent directed graph which consists of 2092 nodes, representing individual narrators, and 77,797 edges represent the Sanad-Hadith connections. The MIS dataset represents multiple ISNAD of the Hadith based on the Sahih Muslim Hadith book. The dataset was carefully extracted from online multiple Hadith sources using data scraping and web crawling techniques tools, providing extensive Hadith details. Each dataset entry provides a complete view of a specific Hadith, including the original book, Hadith number, textual content (MATN), list of narrators, narrator count, sequence of narrators, and ISNAD count. In this paper, four different tools were designed and constructed for modeling and analyzing narrative network such as python library (NetworkX), powerful graph database Neo4j and two different network analysis tools named Gephi and CytoScape. The Neo4j graph database is used to represent the multi-dimensional graph related data for the ease of extraction and establishing new relationships among nodes. Researchers can use MIS to explore Hadith credibility including classification of Hadiths (Sahih=perfection in the Sanad/Dhaif=imperfection in the Sanad), and narrators (trustworthy/not). Traditionally, scholars have focused on identifying the longest and shortest Sanad between two Narrators, but in MIS, the emphasis shifts to determining the optimum/authentic Sanad, considering narrator qualities. The graph representation of the authentic and manually curated dataset will open ways for the development of computational models that could identify the significance of a chain and a narrator. The dataset allows the researchers to provide Hadith narrators and Hadith ISNAD that could be used in a wide variety of future research studies related to Hadith authentication and rules extraction. Moreover, the dataset encourages cross-disciplinary research, bridging the gap between Islamic studies, artificial intelligence (AI), social network analysis (SNA), and Graph Neural Network (GNN). © 2024 The Authors

AB  - The rapid growth of large-scale information and the dynamic nature of user behaviors pose significant challenges for modern information retrieval systems, which often struggle to adapt to non-stationary environments and fail to fully utilize multimodal data, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these issues, this study proposes the adaptive deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for information retrieval and management, which combines RL, multimodal data fusion, and an adaptive update mechanism to dynamically adjust to evolving user preferences and document collections. The adaptive deep RL framework for information retrieval and management employs a RL-based policy network to optimize retrieval strategies, a multimodal encoder to integrate diverse data sources, and an adaptive mechanism to maintain robustness in dynamic scenarios. © 2025 IGI Global.

AB  - Aiming at the problem that the secondary circuit of intelligent substation is inefficient, prone to errors, and unable to meet the current maintenance intensity, this paper studies the intelligent verification technology of substation configuration files based on knowledge graph. Firstly, the paper expounds the technical principle of knowledge graph, and describes it from two aspects, including the construction framework and the construction steps. The description files of intelligent devices in SCD are segmented based on natural language processing technology and matched with the auxiliary phrase thesaurus and SCD virtual circuit template library to ensure the correctness verification of virtual circuits in the next step. A secondary virtual loop verification model of intelligent substation based on knowledge graph is designed to verify the correctness of the virtual circuit. For the expanded substation, a method of knowledge supplement and redundancy auxiliary verification is proposed. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed secondary virtual loop verification model is proved by an example. © 2024 Harbin Jinhe Electrical Measurement & Instrumentation Magazine Publishing Co., Ltd..

AB  - Efficiently responding to public complaints is a necessary measure to realize intelligent management and enhance public satisfaction, and the use of intelligent question answering for public complaints can save time and human resources. However, rule-based and retrieval-based models in intelligent question answering rely on preset knowledge. Therefore, they cannot provide effective responses when complaints are out of the scope of knowledge, nor can they maintain the coherence of conversations when dealing with multiple rounds of dialogues. Existing large language models can communicate smoothly with users, but general-purpose large language models lack domain knowledge. Due to the fact that the correct answers in the training data will contain information not covered by the questions, the general large language model generates wrong responses or answers that are not the questions asked, resulting in hallucination. To address these issues, a large language model (PC-LLM) for intelligent question-and-answer in the domain of public complaints has been constructed. Firstly, an entity relationship extraction model based on BERT-BiLSTM-CRF is designed to extract entities and relationships in the complaint work order in order to construct the complaint knowledge graph. The BERT model is used to vectorize the complaint work order and construct the vector index library of the complaint work order. In the stage of reply generation, this paper extracts the entities and relationships of users’complaints, conducts knowledge reasoning through entity links in the knowledge graph of complaints, obtains potential relationship tips, and uses the knowledge graph of complaints to perform knowledge reasoning to obtain potential relationship hints. Meanwhile, this paper performs quick search of complaints within the vector index library of complaint work orders, and obtains similar complaints. Finally, a more accurate response can be generated by integrating potential relationship prompts, similar complaint prompts and complaint into a large language model. Experimental analysis shows that the performance of this large language model on the complaints dataset is significantly better than that of ChatGPT4o, ERNIE Bot, Tongyi Qianwen, and other large language models. © 2024 Journal of Computer Engineering and Applications Beijing Co., Ltd.; Science Press.

AB  - Objectives: This study aims to (1) review machine learning (ML)-based models for early infection diagnostic and prognosis prediction in post-acute care (PAC) settings, (2) identify key risk predictors influencing infection-related outcomes, and (3) examine the quality and limitations of these models. Materials and Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, CINAHL, and ACM digital library were searched in February 2024. Eligible studies leveraged PAC data to develop and evaluate ML models for infection-related risks. Data extraction followed the CHARMS checklist. Quality appraisal followed the PROBAST tool. Data synthesis was guided by the socio-ecological conceptual framework. Results: Thirteen studies were included, mainly focusing on respiratory infections and nursing homes. Most used regression models with structured electronic health record data. Since 2020, there has been a shift toward advanced ML algorithms and multimodal data, biosensors, and clinical notes being significant sources of unstructured data. Despite these advances, there is insufficient evidence to support performance improvements over traditional models. Individual-level risk predictors, like impaired cognition, declined function, and tachycardia, were commonly used, while contextual-level predictors were barely utilized, consequently limiting model fairness. Major sources of bias included lack of external validation, inadequate model calibration, and insufficient consideration of data complexity. Discussion and Conclusion: Despite the growth of advanced modeling approaches in infection-related models in PAC settings, evidence supporting their superiority remains limited. Future research should leverage a socio-ecological lens for predictor selection and model construction, exploring optimal data modalities and ML model usage in PAC, while ensuring rigorous methodologies and fairness considerations. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) models have shown potential for diagnosing and prognosticating traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI), but their clinical utility remains uncertain. Method: ology: The primary aim was to evaluate the performance of AI algorithms in diagnosing and prognosticating tSCI. Subsequent systematic searching of seven databases identified studies evaluating AI models. PROBAST and TRIPOD tools were used to assess the quality and reporting of included studies (PROSPERO: CRD42023464722). Fourteen studies, comprising 20 models and 280,817 pooled imaging datasets, were included. Analysis was conducted in line with the SWiM guidelines. Results: For prognostication, 11 studies predicted outcomes including AIS improvement (30%), mortality and ambulatory ability (20% each), and discharge or length of stay (10%). The mean AUC was 0.770 (range: 0.682–0.902), indicating moderate predictive performance. Diagnostic models utilising DTI, CT, and T2-weighted MRI with CNN-based segmentation achieved a weighted mean accuracy of 0.898 (range: 0.813–0.938), outperforming prognostic models. Conclusion: AI demonstrates strong diagnostic accuracy (mean accuracy: 0.898) and moderate prognostic capability (mean AUC: 0.770) for tSCI. However, the lack of standardised frameworks and external validation limits clinical applicability. Future models should integrate multimodal data, including imaging, patient characteristics, and clinician judgment, to improve utility and alignment with clinical practice. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - In recent years, applying building information modeling (BIM) digital technologies to cultural heritage management, monitoring, restoration, with the objective of advancing the sustainable development of both cultural heritage protection and tourism in China, has become a prominent research focus. However, there are a few studies that comprehensively investigate the relationship between BIM, Chinese cultural heritage, and sustainable tourism development. In order to explore the application of BIM in the protection and inheritance of Chinese cultural heritage, as well as its potential in promoting the sustainable development of cultural heritage tourism, this paper adopts the quantitative research method of bibliometrics to explore the research hotspots, development background, and evolution trends of BIM-driven sustainable development in Chinese cultural heritage tourism. By using data obtained from the China Knowledge Network database, multi-level bibliometrics analysis has been conducted through visualized knowledge graphs. The results suggest that the popular research keywords for driving sustainable cultural heritage tourism in China through BIM since year 2000 (23 years) include heritage tourism, heritage protection, building heritage, digital technology, and tourism development. Three research hotspots have been identified, which are cultural heritage protection, cultural heritage tourism development, and cultural heritage tourism management. In terms of tourism development and management, building virtual interactive scenes of cultural heritage facilitated by BIM to enhance tourism experience of tourists, using BIM to assist in efficient management, intelligent decision-making, and personalized services of cultural heritage tourism, assist in better promoting the sustainable development of cultural heritage tourism. In terms of coordinating and managing stakeholders in cultural heritage tourism, BIM technology provides technical support to the government, industry managers, and community residents in information communication, and industry management by constructing a digital model of cultural heritage to better balance the rights and interests of stakeholders. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - [Objective] In response to the scarcity of annotated data in the current research on entity relationship extraction and graph construction in the field of intangible cultural heritage (ICH), a lightly annotated relationship extraction scheme is proposed. [Methods] Using silk weaving domain texts as the data source, the SREP model is constructed, integrating domain-specific terminology dictionaries and LTP tools for entity recognition. Subsequently, the BERT model is utilized to vectorize the representation of entities and their contextual text, and various clustering algorithms are applied to different feature combinations for relationship extraction experiments to determine the optimal algorithm and feature combination. The Bootstrapping method is then employed for active learning to expand the instances of relationships. Finally, the extracted relationship triples are imported into Gephi to construct a domain-specific knowledge graph. [Results] The experimental results indicate that the K-means algorithm, combining entity intermediate text features with entity type features, achieved the best results in relationship extraction experiments, identifying five types of relationships. During the relationship instance expansion phase, the LR algorithm is more suitable for active learning methods, with an accuracy rate of 0.860, an improvement of 0.105 over the baseline. [Limitations] The effectiveness of the model needs further verification on larger datasets and relationship extraction in different fields. [Conclusions] The model proposed in this study can effectively extract entity relationships from ICH texts and achieve semantic mining and utilization of structured ICH texts, reducing the dependence on annotated data. © 2024 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Web resources in linked open data (LOD) are comprehensible to humans through literal textual values attached to them, such as labels, notes, or comments. Word choices in literals may not always be neutral. When culturally stereotyping terminology is used in literals, they may appear as offensive to users in interfaces and propagate stereotypes to algorithms trained on them. We study how frequently and in which literals contentious terms about people and cultures occur in LOD and whether there are attempts to mark the usage of such terms. For our analysis, we reuse English and Dutch terms from a knowledge graph that provides opinions of experts from the cultural heritage domain about terms' contentiousness. We inspect occurrences of these terms in four widely used datasets: Wikidata, The Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus, Princeton WordNet, and Open Dutch WordNet. Some terms are ambiguous and contentious only in particular senses. Applying word sense disambiguation, we generate a set of literals relevant to our analysis. We found that contentious terms frequently appear in descriptive and labelling literals, such as preferred labels that are usually displayed in interfaces and used for indexing. In some cases, LOD contributors mark contentious terms with words and phrases in literals (implicit markers) or properties linked to resources (explicit markers). However, such marking is rare and non-consistent in all datasets. Our quantitative and qualitative insights could be helpful in developing more systematic approaches to address the propagation of stereotypes via LOD. © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - This paper explores the application of Recogito Studio for annotating unstructured museum data to create semantic links and visualisations. The study focuses on a sample dataset from National Museums Scotland, which includes metadata about navigational instruments from the 19th and early 20th centuries. The authors aimed to develop methods for converting unstructured data into structured formats using Recogito Studio. Recogito Studio facilitates semantic annotation by allowing users to highlight and tag entities and relationships in texts and images, and link places to online gazetteers. The data model was developed using Linked Art and CIDOC CRM standards, with some bespoke terminology. Annotations focused on unstructured text fields, using Recogito Studio’s Geo-Tagger plugin to identify and tag geographical locations. The geo-tagged data was exported and visualised using Peripleo, requiring several data transformations to ensure compatibility. A user evaluation with cultural heritage professionals revealed usability challenges and areas for improvement, with Recogito Studio receiving a UMUX score of 73.3 and recommendations include enhancing geo-tagging, incorporating Named Entity Recognition, and developing automated workflows for Linked Open Data production. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Redtory was transformed from an old industrial site into a creative park in Guangzhou. Unfortunately, it was demolished in May 2019. It holds a dual significance, representing both Guangzhou’s old industrial era and its first creative park (Art and Design). The objective of this study was to utilize Virtual Reality (VR) technologies to design an immersive environment with a narrative experience and restore the historical memory of Redtory. The project designs the interactive storytelling tour based on Bartle’s taxonomy theory. The VR project includes four primary scenes to tell the Redtory’s story: Starting Scene, Factory Buildings, Historical Square, and Creative Corridor. The study designs various interactive elements to engage tourists during exploration. The study conducted user tests to evaluate the system. A comparative experiment (N = 40) is conducted to evaluate the overall performance of the VR platform. The results indicate that the platform provides a smooth storytelling experience during the virtual tour with minimal bugs or disruptions. The project provides valuable user data and a design flow as a case study reference to contribute to the field of VR historical education. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Objective: Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) represent a prevalent clinical problem, yet distinguishing acute benign variants from malignant pathological fractures constitutes a persistent diagnostic dilemma. To develop and validate a MRI-based nomogram combining clinical and deep learning radiomics (DLR) signatures for the differentiation of benign versus malignant vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted involving 234 VCF patients, randomly allocated to training and testing sets at a 7:3 ratio. Radiomics (Rad) features were extracted using traditional Rad techniques, while 2.5-dimensional (2.5D) deep learning (DL) features were obtained using the ResNet50 model. These features were combined through feature fusion to construct deep learning radiomics (DLR) models. Through a feature fusion strategy, this study integrated eight machine learning architectures to construct a predictive framework, ultimately establishing a visualized risk assessment scale based on multimodal data (including clinical indicators and Rad features).The performance of the various models was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: The standalone Rad model using ExtraTrees achieved AUC=0.801 (95%CI:0.693-0.909) in testing, while the DL model an AUC value of 0.805 (95% CI: 0.690-0.921) in the testing cohort. Compared with the Rad model and DL model, the performance superiority of the DLR model was demonstrated. Among all these models, the DLR model that employed ExtraTrees algorithm performed the best, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.971 (95% CI: 0.948-0.995) in the training dataset and 0.828 (95% CI: 0.727-0.929) in the testing dataset. The performance of this model was further improved when combined with clinical and MRI features to form the DLR nomogram (DLRN), achieving AUC values of 0.981 (95% CI: 0.964-0.998) in the training dataset and 0.871 (95% CI: 0.786-0.957) in the testing dataset. Conclusion: Our study integrates handcrafted radiomics, 2.5D deep learning features, and clinical data into a nomogram (DLRN). This approach not only enhances diagnostic accuracy but also provides superior clinical utility. The novel 2.5D DL framework and comprehensive feature fusion strategy represent significant advancements in the field, offering a robust tool for radiologists to differentiate benign from malignant VCFs.

AB  - Purpose: This scoping review aimed to offer researchers and practitioners an understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in physical activity (PA) interventions; introduce them to prevalent machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms; and encourage the adoption of AI methodologies. Methods: A scoping review was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and EBSCO focusing on AI applications for promoting PA or predicting related behavioral or health outcomes. AI methodologies were summarized and categorized to identify synergies, patterns, and trends informing future research. Additionally, a concise primer on predominant AI methodologies within the realm of PA was provided to bolster understanding and broader application. Results: The review included 24 studies that met the predetermined eligibility criteria. AI models were found effective in detecting significant patterns of PA behavior and associations between specific factors and intervention outcomes. Most studies comparing AI models to traditional statistical approaches reported higher prediction accuracy for AI models on test data. Comparisons of different AI models yielded mixed results, likely due to model performance being highly dependent on the dataset and task. An increasing trend of adopting state-of-the-art DL and RL models over standard ML was observed, addressing complex human–machine communication, behavior modification, and decision-making tasks. Six key areas for future AI adoption in PA interventions emerged: personalized PA interventions, real-time monitoring and adaptation, integration of multimodal data sources, evaluation of intervention effectiveness, expanding access to PA interventions, and predicting and preventing injuries. Conclusion: The scoping review highlights the potential of AI methodologies for advancing PA interventions. As the field progresses, staying informed and exploring emerging AI-driven strategies is essential for achieving significant improvements in PA interventions and fostering overall well-being. © 2023

AB  - With the digitization of archives, fragments of cultural heritage are migrating to dedicated platforms and made available in curated experiences that rely on the curators' work. Polariscope proposes a collaborative storytelling platform to share, visualize and co-create collective memories. It aims to gather citizens and institutions to promote rich digital experiences through interactive and narrative visualizations around meaningful cultural events. The project proposes a solution assisted by Artificial Intelligence (AI) able to generate automatic stories based on these archives. The development methodology and the architecture model of the integration of AI tools are presented in the paper. The paper also presents some promising preliminary results of user testing to achieve such a goal, based on the development of an interaction protocol with GPT 3.5 for the creation of stories. © 2024 ACM.

AB  - The technological leap in the digital age has triggered a higher demand for emotional experiences. Since vision has long been recognized as the most important source of information for people to perceive the city, the visual characteristics of the urban built environment have an important impact on the emotional experience it creates. This study takes the facades and external environments of the representative urban public building category, museums, as the research objects, to explore how different types of built environment elements that make up the museum’s facade and surrounding environment affect the people’s emotional experience by affecting the urban visual quality. Tobii Pro Fusion devices and emotion scales are used for the collection of multimodal data. A total of 298 participants aged between 20 and 25 were recruited to participate in the experiment voluntarily and 229 valid data were finally obtained. The results show that different types of museum facades and external environmental elements have different effects on visual quality and people’s emotional experience: (1) Interactive elements show the most significant impact on visual quality and emotional experience. (2) The impact of artificial elements on visual quality is related to their size and spatial composition on the museum facade. When artificial elements have uniqueness, regionality, and symbolism associated with the museum, they are more likely to trigger people’s emotional experiences. (3) Visual quality is significantly correlated with people’s emotional experience through both preconscious and conscious emotional cognition. The results reveal the impact of different types and characteristics of built environment elements on the visual quality of the urban environment and proves the important role of visual quality in students’ emotional experience, further illustrating that designing and creating a good visual environment is conducive to promoting a humanistic urban environment. Meanwhile, this study also promotes a method of urban visual quality research and evaluation from an emotional perspective, providing a more scientific and objective way for the intervention of “emotions” in built environment research. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Food safety is of vital importance to people's lives. With the improvement of living standards, public concern about food safety has also increased, and the urgent need for reliable and effective information response has arisen. Existing intelligent question-answering systems, such as those based on text vector libraries, have made some progress in knowledge reasoning, problem handling, and semantic relationship recognition, but still have some shortcomings; question-answering systems based on knowledge graphs face inherent challenges in terms of graph construction cost and information recall rate; while question-answering systems based on template matching are poor in question generalization ability and context understanding. This paper proposes an innovative knowledge graph-based intelligent perception question-answering system based on large language models (LLM). Using large language models to improve the shortcomings of the template matching method, combining text vector libraries and knowledge graphs at the same time, and introducing high-dimensional vector semantic search technology into the knowledge graph retrieval process to improve the knowledge graph retrieval recall rate. This innovative approach significantly improves the overall performance of the question-answering system and the user's experience. © 2024 Chinese Institute of Food Science and Technology.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to curate open research knowledge graph (ORKG) with papers related to ontology learning and define an approach using ORKG as a computer-assisted tool to organize key-insights extracted from research papers. Design/methodology/approach: Action research was used to explore, test and evaluate the use of the Open Research Knowledge Graph as a computer assistant tool for knowledge acquisition from scientific papers. Findings: To extract, structure and describe research contributions, the granularity of information should be decided; to facilitate the comparison of scientific papers, one should design a common template that will be used to describe the state of the art of a domain. Originality/value: This approach is currently used to document “food information engineering,” “tabular data to knowledge graph matching” and “question answering” research problems and the “neurosymbolic AI” domain. More than 200 papers are ingested in ORKG. From these papers, more than 800 contributions are documented and these contributions are used to build over 100 comparison tables. At the end of this work, we found that ORKG is a valuable tool that can reduce the working curve of state-of-the-art research. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The topic of data storage, traceability, and data use and reuse in the years following experiments is becoming an important topic in Europe and across the world. Many scientific communities are striving to create open data by the FAIR principles. This is a requirement from the European Commission for EU-funded projects and experiments at EU-funded research infrastructures (RIs) and from many national funding agencies. This is challenging for users of large-scale RIs such as neutron, photon, synchrotron and free-electron laser facilities. Users of photon and neutron (PaN) RIs employ a wide range of scattering, imaging and spectroscopic methods investigating the behaviour of matter with a broad scientific base across physics, chemistry and biology, including engineering, environmental, cultural heritage and medical applications. They produce large data volumes of up to 1PByte per day in some cases. To ensure all these data are FAIR requires an enormous effort from PaN RIs. It requires not only the expansion of data storage capacity, but also the development and deployment of software for effective data storage, metadata schemes and implementation of effective data pipelines at each individual experiment across RIs. FAIR data also affect the carbon footprint related to large amounts of data and raise questions related to user authentication, rights of access and cyber security. The RIs alone cannot achieve such a transformational process. For successful open science, cooperation of the user communities is essential as they need to create and utilize existing tools to deliver FAIR data. In this white paper, the European PaN community outline and discuss the role and responsibilities of the users and RIs and their common accountability to achieve FAIR data. This paper shall serve as a starting point for a common user and RI approach on the European scale to achieve FAIR data.  © 2025 International Union of Crystallography. All rights reserved.

AB  - The grotto temple, carved into cliffs and widely distributed, is a significant cultural heritage in China. However, it faces severe damage and collapse threats due to natural disaster risks in its environment. Nearly seventy percent of grotto temples are located in regions prone to earthquakes and water hazards, leading to varying degrees of damage to cultural artifacts. Therefore, preventive measures are necessary to reduce the impact of natural disasters on grotto temples. A knowledge graph, a structured semantic knowledge base describing concepts and their relationships in the physical world, plays a crucial role in knowledge organization and content representation. Entity relationships are the core of knowledge, serving as both foundational data and a key task in constructing knowledge graphs and processing unstructured text. In the field of grotto temple disease monitoring, while data continues to grow, research on the correlation between textual data remains underexplored. This paper adopts the BiLSTM-CRF method to extract entity relationships, matching them with the grotto temple monitoring knowledge graph. Finally, the Neo4j software is utilized to program and display the knowledge graph, aiming to enhance the efficiency of natural disaster risk management and cultural heritage protection for grotto temples. © 2024 Yiran Wang.

AB  - Images and text have become essential parts of the multimodal machine learning (MMML) framework in today’s world because data are always available, and technological breakthroughs bring disparate forms together, and while text adds semantic richness and narrative to images, images capture visual subtleties and emotions. Together, these two media improve knowledge beyond what would be possible with just one revolutionary application. This paper investigates feature extraction and advancement from text and image data using pre-trained models in MMML. It offers a thorough analysis of fusion architectures, outlining text and image data integration and evaluating their overall advantages and effects. Furthermore, it draws attention to the shortcomings and difficulties that MMML currently faces and guides areas that need more research and development. We have gathered 341 research articles from five digital library databases to accomplish this. Following a thorough assessment procedure, we have 88 research papers that enable us to evaluate MMML in detail. Our findings demonstrate that pre-trained models, such as BERT for text and ResNet for images, are predominantly employed for feature extraction due to their robust performance in diverse applications. Fusion techniques, ranging from simple concatenation to advanced attention mechanisms, are extensively adopted to enhance the representation of multimodal data. Despite these advancements, MMML models face significant challenges, including handling noisy data, optimizing dataset size, and ensuring robustness against adversarial attacks. Our findings highlight the necessity for further research to address these challenges, particularly in developing methods to improve the robustness of MMML models. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The United Nations forecast a significant shift in global population distribution by 2050, with rural populations projected to decline. This decline will particularly challenge mountain areas’ cultural heritage, well-being, and economic sustainability. Understanding the economic, environmental, and societal effects of rural population decline is particularly important in Europe, where mountainous regions are vital for supplying goods. The present paper describes a geospatially explicit semantic knowledge graph containing information on 454 European mountain value chains. It is the first large-size, structured collection of information on mountain value chains. Our graph, structured through ontology-based semantic modelling, offers representations of the value chains in the form of narratives. The graph was constructed semi-automatically from unstructured data provided by mountain-area expert scholars. It is accessible through a public repository and explorable through interactive Story Maps and a semantic Web service. Through semantic queries, we demonstrate that the graph allows for exploring territorial complexities and discovering new knowledge on mountain areas’ environmental, societal, territory, and economic aspects that could help stem depopulation. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The prosperity of software applications brings fierce market competition to developers. Employing third-party libraries (TPLs) to add new features to projects under development and to reduce the time to market has become a popular way in the community. However, given the tremendous TPLs ready for use, it is challenging for developers to effectively and efficiently identify the most suitable TPLs. To tackle this obstacle, we propose an innovative approach named PyRec to recommend potentially useful TPLs to developers for their projects. Taking Python project development as a use case, PyRec embeds Python projects, TPLs, contextual information, and relations between those entities into a knowledge graph. Then, it employs a graph neural network to capture useful information from the graph to make TPL recommendations. Different from existing approaches, PyRec can make full use of not only project-library interaction information but also contextual information to make more accurate TPL recommendations. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted based on 12,421 Python projects involving 963 TPLs, 9,675 extra entities, 121,474 library usage records, and 73,277 contextual records. Compared with five representative approaches, PyRec improves the recommendation performance significantly in all cases.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Axillary lymph nodes (ALN) status serves as a crucial prognostic indicator in breast cancer (BC). The aim of this study was to construct a radiogenomic multimodal model, based on machine learning and whole-transcriptome sequencing (WTS), to accurately evaluate the risk of ALN metastasis (ALNM), drug therapeutic response and avoid unnecessary axillary surgery in BC patients. METHODS: In this study, conducted a retrospective analysis of 1078 BC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), and Foshan cohort. These patients were divided into the TCIA cohort ( N =103), TCIA validation cohort ( N =51), Duke cohort ( N =138), Foshan cohort ( N =106), and TCGA cohort ( N =680). Radiological features were extracted from BC radiological images and differentially expressed gene expression was calibrated using technology. A support vector machine model was employed to screen radiological and genetic features, and a multimodal model was established based on radiogenomic and clinical pathological features to predict ALNM. The accuracy of the model predictions was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) and the clinical benefit was measured using decision curve analysis. Risk stratification analysis of BC patients was performed by gene set enrichment analysis, differential comparison of immune checkpoint gene expression, and drug sensitivity testing. RESULTS: For the prediction of ALNM, rad-score was able to significantly differentiate between ALN- and ALN+ patients in both the Duke and Foshan cohorts ( P <0.05). Similarly, the gene-score was able to significantly differentiate between ALN- and ALN+ patients in the TCGA cohort ( P <0.05). The radiogenomic multimodal nomogram demonstrated satisfactory performance in the TCIA cohort (AUC 0.82, 95% CI: 0.74-0.91) and the TCIA validation cohort (AUC 0.77, 95% CI: 0.63-0.91). In the risk sub-stratification analysis, there were significant differences in gene pathway enrichment between high and low-risk groups ( P <0.05). Additionally, different risk groups may exhibit varying treatment responses ( P <0.05). CONCLUSION: Overall, the radiogenomic multimodal model employs multimodal data, including radiological images, genetic, and clinicopathological typing. The radiogenomic multimodal nomogram can precisely predict ALNM and drug therapeutic response in BC patients. Copyright © 2024 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Knowledge Graphs are becoming widely used as a method to capture and integrate diverse sources of data into a unified structure of nodes and links. Cultural heritage is an active domain for Knowledge Graph research, bringing together the metadata of cultural objects with associated information about their use and history. Tools exist for the searching and browsing of Knowledge Graphs but on their own they often do not offer the interpretative support required by a more general audience. This paper describes an approach to creating a layer of interpretation over a Knowledge Graph. Experts in the cultural domain, without expertise in the underlying technology, can curate paths through the Knowledge Graph, selecting and associating cultural objects, which are automatically displayed in the path with relevant content from the Knowledge Graph. Path authors can also provide additional interpretation as well invite responses from followers of the paths. A case study is described in the domain of European pipe organs in which domain experts can curate paths through a Knowledge Graph of currently approximately 2000 objects. The potential of the approach as a way of incrementally formalizing changes or additions to the Knowledge Graph emerged as a theme with domain experts. The applicability of the approach to cultural Knowledge Graphs in general is discussed.  © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - Despite a proliferation of digitally enhanced makerspaces in public libraries, there is an acute need for libraries to explore new strategies to broaden the engagement of diverse groups, especially those who do not see themselves as technology oriented. This qualitative nexus analytical inquiry analyses multimodal data from a Hebocon robot-making activity situated in a Finnish public library makerspace, targeting library and youth workers as participants. The findings illuminate how the Hebocon format helped to promote the democratization of technology and the inclusion of novices in robot-making activities, enhancing practice change by creating a safe space in which the participants felt confident about experimenting and being creative. This study contributes to research on maker practices and formats aligned with public libraries' mission particularly from the perspective of robot-making event organization, showcasing the value of the nexus analysis framework to guide research in this area. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Recently, uncertain knowledge graphs (UKGs), where each relation between entities is associated with a confidence score, have gained much attention. Compared with traditional knowledge graphs, UKGs possess the capability of uncertainty knowledge expression, which facilitates more reliable and precise knowledge graph reasoning by not only completing missing triples but also predicting triple confidences. In this paper, we release unKR, the first open-source python library for uncertain Knowledge graph (UKG) Reasoning by representation learning. We design a unified framework to implement two types of representation learning models for UKG reasoning, i.e., normal and few-shot ones. Besides, we standardize the evaluation tasks and metrics for UKG reasoning to ensure fair comparisons, and report the detailed results of each model under the consistent test setting. With unKR, it is effortless for users to reproduce existing models, as well as efficiently customize their own models. The library, documentation, demo, and re-implementing results are all publicly released at https://github.com/seucoin/unKR. © 2024 ACM.

AB  - Background: The increasing aging population has led to a shortage of geriatric chronic disease caregiver, resulting in inadequate care for elderly people. In this global context, many older people rely on nonprofessional family care. The credibility of existing health websites cannot meet the needs of care. Specialized health knowledge bases such as SNOMED—CT and UMLS are also difficult for nonprofessionals to use. Furthermore, professional caregiver in elderly care institutions also face difficulty caring for multiple elderly people at the same time and working handovers. As a solution, we propose a smart care system for the elderly based on a knowledge graph. Method: First, we worked with professional caregivers to design a structured questionnaire to collect more than 100 pieces of care-related information for the elderly. Then, in the proposed system, personal information, smart device data, medical knowledge, and nursing knowledge are collected and organized into a dynamic knowledge graph. The system offers report generation, question answering, risk identification and data updating services. To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, we use the expert evaluation method to score the user experience. Results: The results of the study showed that compared to existing tools (health websites, archives and expert team consultation), the system achieved a score of 8 or more for basic information, health support and Dietary information. Some secondary evaluation indicators reached 9 and 10 points. This finding suggested that the system is superior to existing tools. We also present a case study to help the reader understand the role of the system. Conclusion: The smart care system provide personalized care guidelines for nonprofessional caregivers. It also makes the job easier for institutional caregivers. In addition, the system provides great convenience for work handover. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - In cognitive neuroscience, the integration of deep neural networks (DNNs) with traditional neuroscientific analyses has significantly advanced our understanding of both biological neural processes and the functioning of DNNs. However, challenges remain in effectively comparing the representational spaces of artificial models and brain data, particularly due to the growing variety of models and the specific demands of neuroimaging research. To address these challenges, we present Net2Brain, a Python-based toolbox that provides an end-to-end pipeline for incorporating DNNs into neuroscience research, encompassing dataset download, a large selection of models, feature extraction, evaluation, and visualization. Net2Brain provides functionalities in four key areas. First, it offers access to over 600 DNNs trained on diverse tasks across multiple modalities, including vision, language, audio, and multimodal data, organized through a carefully structured taxonomy. Second, it provides a streamlined API for downloading and handling popular neuroscience datasets, such as the NSD and THINGS dataset, allowing researchers to easily access corresponding brain data. Third, Net2Brain facilitates a wide range of analysis options, including feature extraction, representational similarity analysis (RSA), and linear encoding, while also supporting advanced techniques like variance partitioning and searchlight analysis. Finally, the toolbox integrates seamlessly with other established open source libraries, enhancing interoperability and promoting collaborative research. By simplifying model selection, data processing, and evaluation, Net2Brain empowers researchers to conduct more robust, flexible, and reproducible investigations of the relationships between artificial and biological neural representations.

AB  - [Purpose/Significance] The generative natural language processing model represented by ChatGPT is beginning to show great application potential in libraries, and its technical advantages coincide with the development needs of knowledge services, greatly improving the quality and efficiency of user services. [Method/Process] Starting with the introduction of ChatGPT's development history, technical advantages and theoretical and practical research achievements of Chinese and foreign academic circles, this paper explains its technical advantages in cross-modal information organization, text generation, and in-depth mining of user behavior. The most direct use of ChatGPT for a library is to connect the library's collection resources to ChatGPTAPI. Using machine transformer, human feedback reinforcement learning and other technologies to create its own open source chat machine model with intelligent interactive question and answer, text and image multi-mode generation, semantic search and discrimination and other functions, the application scenario covers a range of areas from basic library information services to intelligent knowledge services. During the consultation, users can use natural language to communicate directly with the model, and ChatGPT uses semantic analysis and pre-training models to fine-tune the language environment to provide a more accurate question and answer service in different contexts. During a search, the multi-modal technology of ChatGPT can fully realize the multi-source heterogeneous data input of information resources inside and outside the library, so as to effectively solve the problem of multi-dimensional, multi-level and multi-source cross-mode "heterogeneous aggregation" in information retrieval, and help search engines find more comprehensive search results. In addition, ChatGPT automatically generates subject resources such as abstracts or reviews that are highly relevant to the knowledge content of the user's ongoing conversation. By accurately capturing and analyzing the profile characteristics of users' interests and hobbies, ChatGPT can recommend personalized subject guidance services to them based on knowledge graphs, and quickly realize effective collection, refinement and analysis of knowledge related to required subject areas. At the same time, the application focuses on the risks and challenges posed by technical limitations, intellectual property rights, user privacy, harmful information, data sources, academic integrity and other aspects. [Results/Conclusions] In the future, ChatGPT will be embedded in knowledge services with a new quality of productivity, but it is necessary to recognize the limitations and security risks of this technology. At this stage, libraries should take a series of measures in advance to integrate business platforms and resources, strengthen internal system security prevention, improve the risk supervision mechanism and enhance the professional quality of librarians to fully cope with the crisis. It also provides a new research focus for libraries to actively build their own language interaction model in the future. Given the limited practical experience of ChatGPT in the library knowledge service, this paper only provides a risk analysis and prediction in the application, and the specific implementation path and rules in the future need further study. © 2024 Agricultural Information Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

AB  - Background: Target identification and hit identification can be transformed through the application of biomedical knowledge analysis, AI-driven virtual screening and robotic cloud lab systems. However there are few prospective studies that evaluate the efficacy of such integrated approaches. Results: We synergistically integrate our in-house-developed target evaluation (SpectraView) and deep-learning-driven virtual screening (HydraScreen) tools with an automated robotic cloud lab designed explicitly for ultra-high-throughput screening, enabling us to validate these platforms experimentally. By employing our target evaluation tool to select IRAK1 as the focal point of our investigation, we prospectively validate our structure-based deep learning model. We can identify 23.8% of all IRAK1 hits within the top 1% of ranked compounds. The model outperforms traditional virtual screening techniques and offers advanced features such as ligand pose confidence scoring. Simultaneously, we identify three potent (nanomolar) scaffolds from our compound library, 2 of which represent novel candidates for IRAK1 and hold promise for future development. Conclusion: This study provides compelling evidence for SpectraView and HydraScreen to provide a significant acceleration in the processes of target identification and hit discovery. By leveraging Ro5’s HydraScreen and Strateos’ automated labs in hit identification for IRAK1, we show how AI-driven virtual screening with HydraScreen could offer high hit discovery rates and reduce experimental costs. Scientific contribution: We present an innovative platform that leverages Knowledge graph-based biomedical data analytics and AI-driven virtual screening integrated with robotic cloud labs. Through an unbiased, prospective evaluation we show the reliability and robustness of HydraScreen in virtual and high-throughput screening for hit identification in IRAK1. Our platforms and innovative tools can expedite the early stages of drug discovery. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The Heritage Building Information Modeling (HBIM) is a consistent approach to support the multidisciplinary process of knowledge, conservation, and valorization of the historical building heritage, exploiting the combination of advanced 3D modelling and heterogeneous informative data. In the present paper, a highly customized HBIM workflow is developed for the enhancement and conservation of the byzantine Stylite Tower in the Jordan archaeological site of Umm ar-Rasas. The case study is considered a benchmark to test the effectiveness and the scalability of the proposed methodology for the broader set of ancient structures located in archaeological sites. The proposed HBIM process has a dual aim: the organization of heterogeneous and fragmented sources concerning the history and the actual state maintenance of the Tower and the development of a flexible tool to perform fast qualitative and quantitative analysis oriented towards conservation and management projects. The small scale of the structure and an innovative semi-automatic modelling process based on visual coding allowed for a stone-by-stone segmentation of the Tower. The model procedure is based on an information management workflow based on CIDOC-CRM ontology and the interchange format Industry Foundation Classes to ensure interoperability, developing an open-access interactive visualization of the model of the Tower, embedding organized document sources. The proposed HBIM model can also be a valuable tool for enhanced monument fruition and dissemination activities of the structure. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The digital humanities have witnessed a clear development in recent years due partly to their adoption of Semantic Web and linked data technologies and the creation of knowledge bases. In this work, we target the creation of an ontology and knowledge base for literature data representation based on the IFLA Library Reference Model (LRM). IFLA LRM is the main model for book-related data, allowing for a fine representation of the various layers that constitute a book. However, by design, it doesn't deal with some aspects usually available in literature databases, such as information about authors, literary awards or book themes. As a result, LRM requires some extensions to be able to represent ancillary data. Another challenge is the querying of IFLA LRM knowledge bases, with a performance cost that comes with the fine-grained expressivity of the LRM model, which creates longer and therefore typically slower SPARQL queries. In this work, we propose an extension to the IFLA LRM ontology called IFLA LRM∗that targets these limitations including a connection to the vocabulary Schema.org and to the taxonomies Thema and Dewey Decimal, and the representation of literary awards. We also present a practical case study on using our extended model to create a Quebec literature knowledge base, discussing the interest of our extensions.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Abstract: The paper discusses an approach to constructing a knowledge graph based on a digital semantic library. The library ontology defines the data structure of the library content. Each data element loaded into the library can be associated with an ontology vertex, which determines the position of the data element in the ontology. The knowledge graph is built on the basis of ontology connections and connections determined at the stage of creating a semantic description of the subject area in the library. Using the example of the ontology of the Mathematics subject area in the LibMeta library, the technology for generating a knowledge graph of encyclopedic knowledge and modern applications in mathematics is discussed. The problems of filling the graph, embedding data in the graph, and extracting connections and nodes of the graph are discussed. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2024.

AB  - In response to the shortcomings of the SPOC course "Introduction to Computational Thinking"at Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture, the teaching team has transformed and improved the course design and practice based on the existing High quality undergraduate courses in Beijing universities and Beijing Curriculum Ideological and Political Demonstration Course. We aim to maintain consistency and linkage in learning objectives, learning assessments, teaching materials, learning activities, and course technology under the principle of consistent construction. Learning objectives are clearer and more measurable; learning assessment is more scientific, diverse, and reliable; Curriculum resources can meet the needs of students at different levels and majors; learning activities can fully mobilize students' subjective initiative; Curriculum technology helps to achieve learning objectives, and can reflect the characteristics of the discipline, with universality and progressiveness. Through the construction and practice of the FD-QM standard, the course team has established the principles of course standardization, clarified the direction of course material construction, drawn a knowledge graph of course knowledge points, accurately grasped the degree of learning objectives, upgraded the "characteristic"teaching resource library, enhanced student interest, and integrated ideological and political education into the curriculum, ultimately achieving a comprehensive improvement in the quality of course teaching.  © 2024 ACM.

AB  - Studying the preservation and reuse of industrial heritage can improve people's knowledge and understanding of cultural heritage, thus deepening their sense of identity and belonging to the local culture. This study applies the theory of placeness to protect industrial architectural heritage, promote the organic revitalization of urban space, enhance local identity, and realize the visualization of tacit knowledge. Based on the theory of placeness, this study constructs an indicator system for industrial architectural heritage renewal strategy. The indicator system includes four primary indicators, namely State of Matter, Policy System, Behavior and Spirit, and 23 secondary indicators. Exploratory factor analysis is carried out using the post-evaluation (POE) method. This study concludes that (1) there are seven strategy combinations for industrial heritage renewal, including artistic expression, landscape and space, humanistic connotation, industrial building, history and culture, architectural features, and construction skills. The combination of strategies can enhance the locality and architectural originality. (2) The strategy combinations can be used in the design, construction, and operation stages of the whole life cycle and have been empirically demonstrated in typical projects in Guangzhou. Building Construction Atlas, Climatic Suitability, Building History/People, and Industrial Equipment have a higher contribution to the renewal effect of industrial buildings. (3) The 23 renewal strategy elements based on placeness provide new ideas for coding methods of historic buildings and modeling of historic building information model (HBIM). These strategy elements can be used to construct a knowledge graph of historic buildings and visualize tacit knowledge to promote sustainable construction and twin city construction. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigates the evolving trends in cultural heritage tourism experience design and examines how machine learning technologies are being applied to enhance visitor engagement and heritage preservation. Using bibliometric data from the Web of Science (WoS) and visualization tools such as VOSviewer, the research identifies key themes, author collaborations, and keyword clusters from 2016 to 2025. The analysis reveals a shift in focus from traditional conservation and display methods to user-centered experiences supported by advanced technologies. Machine learning techniques—such as deep learning, natural language processing, and multimodal data fusion—are increasingly used to personalize tours, analyze tourist behavior, restore damaged artifacts, and improve decision-making in resource management. Tools like CNNs and BERT models enable smart guiding systems and interactive Q&A features, while sentiment analysis enhances feedback mechanisms. The study also highlights several ongoing challenges, including data privacy issues, algorithmic bias, and unequal access to technological infrastructure, especially in developing regions. Ethical considerations and the need for human-centered design principles are emphasized to ensure that technological innovation aligns with cultural values and sustainability goals. In conclusion, this research provides a comprehensive overview of academic progress in cultural heritage tourism and illustrates the growing importance of AI and machine learning in creating immersive, efficient, and culturally respectful tourism experiences. The findings offer practical insights for scholars, heritage site managers, and policymakers seeking to leverage digital tools for both preservation and enhanced visitor satisfaction. © (2025), (Science and Information Organization).

AB  - Considering challenges such as diverse crop varieties, complex disease types, significant sample data imbalance, varied prescription categories, and multi-modal data, prescription recommendation methods tailored to diverse, extensible, and multi-modal application scenarios were explored by using multi-modal EMR data. To accommodate the varying prescription preferences of agricultural producers, a diversified crop disease prescription recommendation model based on CdsBERT RCNN and diagnostic reasoning was developed, improving diagnostic accuracy and prescription diversity for 32 common diseases. For untrained rare diseases and newly added prescriptions, an extensible crop disease prescription recommendation model based on MC SEM and semantic retrieval was developed, enhancing semantic matching accuracy and case library retrieval speed, and providing prescription recommendations for untrained diseases. For multimodal information collection and input, a multi-modal crop disease prescription recommendation model based on BATNet multi-layer feature fusion was developed, enhancing prescription recommendation performance for multimodal data inputs. Results demonstrated that CdsBERT RCNN achieved an 85. 65% diagnostic accuracy and an F1 score of 85. 63% across the 32 common diseases. In tests with varying input completeness levels, the model achieved 81. 19% accuracy with symptom information alone, and the inclusion of environmental and crop information improved accuracy by 1. 65 percentage points and 3. 61 percentage points, respectively. MC SEM achieved a Pearson correlation coefficient of 86. 34% and a Spearman correlation coefficient of 77. 67% for EMR semantic matching tasks; and achieved accuracy of 88. 20% and 82. 04% in the closed-set and open-set prescription recommendation tests, respectively, demonstrating its capability to expand to untrained diseases. BATNet achieved an accuracy and F1 score of 98. 88% and 98. 83%, respectively, for multi-modal input prescription recommendation tasks. Application scenario analysis and testing validated the model's generalization capability for incomplete modalities (pure text or pure image) and incomplete information input (crop, environment, symptoms). The research result would provide an idea for digitally enabled crop disease control decision-making. © 2025 Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery. All rights reserved.

AB  - To provide a sustainable methodology for documenting the small (and underfunded) but often important university heritage collections. The sequence proposed by the DBLC (Database Life Cycle) (Coronel and Morris, Database Systems: Design, Implementation, & Management. Cengage Learning, Boston, 2018; Oppel Databases a beginner’s guide. McGraw-Hill, New York, 2009) is followed, focusing on the database design phase. The resulting proposals aim at harmonising the different documentation tools developed by GLAM institutions (acronym that aims to highlight the common aspects of Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums), all of which are present in the university environment. The work phases are based mainly on the work of Valle, Fernández Cacho, and Arenillas (Muñoz Cruz et al. Introducción a la documentación del patrimonio cultural. Consejería de Cultura de la Junta de Andalucía, Seville, 2017), combined with the experience acquired from the creation of the virtual museum at our institution. The creation of a working team that includes university staff members is recommended because we believe that universities have sufficient power to manage their own heritage. For documentation, we recommend the use of application profiles that consider the new trends in semantic web and LOD (Linked Open Data) and that are created using structural interchange standards such as Dublin Core, LIDO, or Darwin Core, which should be combined with content and value standards adapted from the GLAM area. The application of the methodology described above will make it possible to obtain quality metadata in a sustainable way given the limited resources of university collections. A proposed metadata schema is provided as an annex. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Introduction: Previous brain studies of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) often used single-modal neuroimaging, missing the complexity captured by multimodal data. Growth hormone affects gut microbiota and metabolism in GHD. However, from a gut-brain axis (GBA) perspective, the relationship between abnormal GHD brain development and microbiota alterations remains unclear. The ultimate goal is to uncover the manifestations underlying GBA abnormalities in GHD and idiopathic short stature (ISS). Methods: Participants included 23 GHD and 25 ISS children. The fusion independent component analysis was applied to integrate multimodal brain data (highresolution structural, diffusion tensor, and resting-state functional MRI) covering regional homogeneity (ReHo), amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF), and white matter fractional anisotropy (FA). Gut microbiome diversity and metabolites were analyzed using 16S sequencing and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR). Associations between multimodal neuroimaging and cognition were assessed using moderation analysis. Results: Six independent components (IC) of ReHo, ALFF, and FA differed significantly between GHD and ISS patients, with three functional components linked to the processing speed index. GHD individuals showed higher levels of acetate, nicotinate, and lysine in microbiota metabolism. Higher alpha diversity in GHD strengthened connections between ReHo-IC1, ReHo-IC5, ALFF-IC1, and the processing speed index, while increasing agathobacter levels in ISS weakened the link between ALFF-IC1 and the speech comprehension index. Conclusions: Our findings uncover differing brain structure and functional fusion in GHD, alongside microbiota metabolism of short-chain fatty acids. Additionally, microbiome influences connections between neuroimaging and cognition, offering insight into diverse GBA patterns in GHD and ISS, enhancing our understanding of the disease's pathophysiology and interventions.  © 2024 S.

AB  - Large parts of museum collections, particularly in the Netherlands, are a legacy of the colonial past, guiding people's societal perceptions of cultures and histories. There have been increasing efforts to ensure that museums acknowledge and reveal to visitors the multiple (e.g., cultural) meanings and contexts attached to objects in these collections. We address this as an effort to increase polyvocality. The present work contributes to the effort to emphasize, but objectively acknowledge, multiple (perhaps conflicting) perspectives attached to cultural resources. We provide a measurement to assess polyvocality amongst individuals and a case study including an adaptive, polyvocal exhibition design. The developed Virtual Reality (VR) exhibition curates the flag of Suriname (1975 - today), in which participants interactively encountered multiple perspectives on the flag's colors and, in three different sceneries, learned how those relate to Suriname's history. Our quantitative findings (obtained among a smaller sample of N 20) revealed that the experience fostered a polyvocal mindset, which is supported by our qualitative analyses highlighting key polyvocal elements in the virtual environment. In sum, the present approach further explicates the polyvocality construct, proposes ways of assessing a polyvocal mindset, and recommends design principles to tailor polyvocality-enhancing VR applications.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Version incompatibility issues are prevalent when reusing or reproducing deep learning (DL) models and applications. Compared with official API documentation, which is often incomplete or out-of-date, Stack Overflow (SO) discussions possess a wealth of version knowledge that has not been explored by previous approaches. To bridge this gap, we present Decide, a web-based visualization of a knowledge graph that contains 2,376 version knowledge extracted from SO discussions. As an interactive tool, Decide allows users to easily check whether two libraries are compatible and explore compatibility knowledge of certain DL stack components with or without the version specified. A video demonstrating the usage of Decide is available at https://youtu.be/wqPxF2ZaZo0. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.

AB  - The knowledge graph question answering algorithm is deeply discussed, which provides strong technical support for improving the accuracy of knowledge graph question answering algorithm. Based on the semantic similarity of the problem and the relation, a problem embedding model combining the two characteristics of words and words is established. Then, in order to improve the inference performance of this method on long links, a convolutional neural network for extracting higher-order vector information with embedded vectors is established. The medical knowledge graph question answering system is taken as a case study. This project intends to use Apache jena storage, RDF triadic representation, Jieba segmentation, Echarte and other methods to build knowledge graph. A pharmacologic knowledge answering system based on Apache jena was established by combining Python Django and Apache fuseki library. The experiment proves that this system can realize the interactive answer between doctors and patients, effectively improve the diagnosis and treatment effect of patients, and also bring great convenience to patients. © 2024 ACM.

AB  - Graph databases are emerging as the leading data management technology for storing large knowledge graphs; significant efforts are ongoing to produce new standards (such as the Graph Query Language, GQL), as well as enrich them with properties, types, schemas, and keys. In this article, we introduce PG-Triggers, a complete proposal for adding triggers to Property Graphs, along the direction marked by the SQL3 Standard. We define the syntax and semantics of PG-Triggers and then illustrate how they can be implemented on top of Neo4j, one of the most popular graph databases. In particular, we introduce a syntax-directed translation from PG-Triggers into Neo4j, which makes use of the so-called APOC triggers; APOC is a community-contributed library for augmenting the Cypher query language supported by Neo4j. We also cover Memgraph, and show that our approach applies to this system in a similar way. We illustrate the use of PG-Triggers through a life science application inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic. The main objective of this article is to introduce an active database standard for graph databases as a first-class citizen at a time when reactive graph management is in its infancy, so as to minimize the conversion efforts towards a full-fledged standard proposal.  © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - [Objective] This paper reviews multimodal named entity recognition research to provide references for future studies. [Coverage] We selected 83 representative papers using“multimodal named entity recognition”, “multimodal information extraction”, and“multimodal knowledge graph”as the search terms for the Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ACM digital library, and CNKI databases. [Methods] We summarized the multimodal named entity recognition research in four aspects: concepts, feature representation, fusion strategies, and pretrained models. We also identified existing problems and future research directions. [Results] Multimodal named entity recognition studies focus on modal feature representation and fusion. It made some progress in the field of social media. They need to improve multimodal fine-grained feature extraction and semantic association mapping methods to enhance the models’generalization and interpretability. [Limitations] There is insufficient literature directly using multimodal named entity recognition as a research topic. [Conclusions] Our study provides new ideas to expand the applications of multimodal learning, break the modal barriers, and bridge the semantic gaps. © 2024 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - In response to the problems of low entity recognition accuracy, low user satisfaction, and weak interactivity in the construction of knowledge graph for digital display of museum cultural relics, this article studied the application of supergroup algorithms and knowledge graph construction in museum digital display platforms to solve the existing problems. By utilizing the K-means algorithm in the supergroup algorithm to conduct a survey of visitors to Museum A and analyze the behavior of 180 selected visitors, the display effect and audience satisfaction can be improved. Various knowledge graph technologies were utilized to construct a knowledge graph of museum cultural relics. Various knowledge resources in museums were associated and integrated, and through the collection and processing of museum cultural relic data, cultural relic ontology construction and relationship extraction were achieved, providing viewers with richer and more in-depth display content. Through experiments, it was found that the visitor satisfaction rate based on the K-means algorithm was above 92.68 %, and the average visitor satisfaction rate after 10 experiments was 94.25 %. The accuracy, recall, and F1 values of the museum cultural relics knowledge graph studied in this article were 90.12 %, 84.69 %, and 82.23 %, respectively, which were much higher than other types of knowledge graphs. By applying these advanced technologies to the digital display platform of museums, not only can the visitor experience be improved, but also the digitalization process of museums can be promoted, contributing to cultural dissemination and development. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - With the advent of the era of big data and artificial intelligence, cultural and research institutions represented by cultural centers are conducting research on cultural digitization and digital library construction. Agricultural culture is a precious asset of China's agriculture and an important component of Chinese culture. However, due to the current concentration of research on agricultural culture in academic literature and cultural museums, there are problems such as a long history, scattered and inconsistent resource information, low completeness and correlation of information data, and severe fragmentation, which are not conducive to the digital preservation, knowledge sharing, and intelligent services of agricultural cultural resources. By analyzing the concepts, objects, and attributes of traditional agricultural tools, a traditional agricultural tool ontology model was created using the open-source knowledge graph tool development platform Prot é g é. Map the ontology model to the graph database, use the Neo4j database to import and organize the traditional agricultural tool data of the Agricultural Culture Museum, and complete the construction of the traditional agricultural tool knowledge graph. Finally, using Power BI tools to build a visualization platform, the association and mining of agricultural tool knowledge can be achieved, thereby promoting the sharing and inheritance of agricultural culture, providing new ideas for the construction of digital agricultural culture museums, and promoting the transformation and upgrading development of agricultural cultural industries.  © 2024 ACM.

AB  - Recently, the revival of the semantic similarity concept has been featured by the rapidly growing artificial intelligence research fueled by advanced deep learning architectures enabling machine intelligence using multimodal data. Thus, semantic similarity in multimodal data has gained substantial attention among researchers. However, the existing surveys on semantic similarity measures are restricted to a single modality, mainly text, which significantly limits the capability to understand the intelligence of real-world application scenarios. This study critically reviews semantic similarity approaches by shortlisting 223 vital articles from the leading databases and digital libraries to offer a comprehensive and systematic literature survey. The notable contribution is to illuminate the evolving landscape of semantic similarity and its crucial role in understanding, interpreting, and extracting meaningful information from multimodal data. Primarily, it highlights the challenges and opportunities inherent in different modalities, emphasizing the significance of advancements in cross-modal and multimodal semantic similarity approaches with potential application scenarios. Finally, the survey concludes by summarizing valuable future research directions. The insights provided in this survey improve the understanding and pave the way for further innovation by guiding researchers in leveraging the strength of semantic similarity for an extensive range of real-world applications. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Due to factors such as suboptimal construction quality and severe environmental disasters, a range of dangerous situations, including landslides, cracks, and flooding, may arise during the operational and maintenance stages of earth—rock dams. At present, a large amount of data related to dangers of earth and rock dam is dispersed and exists in diverse forms, posing challenges for its conversion into experiential knowledge for efficient utilization and swift guidance in hazard mitigation. Consequently, a knowledge graph (KG) construction method is proposed in this study, integrating ontology and Natural Language Processing (NLP). To construct pattern and data layers of the graph, this method employs the top—down and bottom—up methods, respectively. The pattern layer centers on three primary concepts; risk types, risk causes, and risk disposal measures. A domain ontology library is established encompassing four facets of earth-rock dam structure, process, environment, and materials, and a conceptual framework of KG is built. The construction of the data layer encompasses operations such as data preprocessing, knowledge extraction, and semantic alignment. NLP is employed to process the text and formulate extraction rules based on corpus characteristics, facilitating the acquisition of specific knowledge content for the data layer. Ultimately, various types of instances and their relationships are stored in the form of triplets. The Neo4j platform is employed to actualize the visual representation and querying application of the KG within the dangers of earth-rock dam. This transformation of dispersed data in the domain into integrated knowledge offers essential technical and theoretical support for the safety management and hazard mitigation of earth-rock dams. © 2024 International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation and China Water and Power Press.

AB  - The importance of paradata and metadata in fully complying with FAIR data principles is clear, particularly within the context of 3D models that are shared online through platforms such as Sketchfab [1], where it is expected that other users will want to use/reuse the models. Paradata and metadata serve crucial roles in elucidating the decision-making process behind the design and reconstruction of 3D models depicting historical sites or objects. The process of optimizing 3D models significantly impacts the documentary value and authenticity of the final model. Understanding the dynamics is essential for transparency and reliability in representing cultural heritage. At the same time, integrating metadata into an immersive web-based platform presents challenges as it risks disrupting the narrative flow. This paper uses the case study of the UNESCO Dive into Heritage (DIH) project, which combines reused existing 3D models, newly acquired 3D data captured by UNESCO, and original 3D models by UNOSAT to create an immersive experience. This paper aims to start a discussion about best practices on the representation of paradata on websites like the DIH platform that will enrich the user experience while ensuring scholarly rigor and authenticity are maintained throughout the exploration of cultural heritage and their narratives. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - This paper designs a multimodal data mining and learning behavior analysis model for civic education, uses improved clustering and association rule algorithms to analyze the multimodal data obtained from students, mines the basic consumption, learning and life behavior characteristics, and carries out analysis of the students' civic situation in order to take targeted civic education measures. Aiming at the problem that traditional clustering results are greatly affected by the selection of initial clustering centers, Gaussian density function is used to determine the initial clustering centers, and Euclidean distance is replaced by density-sensitive distance to avoid sensitivity to noise and anomalies, which improves the accuracy of the clustering results of students' behaviors. Then we use the FP-Growth association rule algorithm to improve the Apriori construction, recursively and iteratively construct the frequent pattern tree and get the final frequent item set, which improves the efficiency of student behavior data mining. After analyzing the processed student data of a university, it is found that most of the students have low interest in borrowing books, 38.22% of the students borrowed only 2.19 books on average, and the total number of times of book borrowing is only 5.4 times, and the average number of days of single borrowing is 62.3 days, and the school library needs to increase the promotion of students' reading, which can be done through the way of offline book fairs and e-recommendations to improve students' interest in reading books. Reading interest. The study makes a useful exploration for the informatization and intelligentization of ideological education in colleges and universities. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - This research explores the computational empowerment of intangible cultural heritage through interactive generative platforms. Prototypes in TouchDesigner software visualize traditional Kam minority patterns by applying particle system effects to highlight symbolic meanings. Users actively transform heritage visuals through real-time interaction, fostering cultural appreciation. Technical realization involves visual programming to construct specialized generative workflows. Phases of diffusion and dissipation of culturally significant motifs are configured procedurally. Preliminary explorations will inform training generative AI models by discerning cultural logic. The goal is an adaptive living database where tradition evolves algorithmically. This pioneering approach synergizes heritage and technology to maintain intangible culture. It provides a model for participatory digital curation where communities actively shape legacies. Limitations around complexity persist. However, the research pioneers cultural resilience through computational creativity. © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - Digital heritage portal interfaces are generally similar to digital library and search engine interfaces in displaying search results as a list of brief metadata records. The knowledge organization and search result display of these systems are item-centric, with little support for identifying relationships between items. This paper proposes a knowledge graph system and visualization interface as a promising solution for digital heritage systems to support users in browsing related items, understanding the relationships between items, and synthesizing a narrative on an issue. The paper discusses design issues for the knowledge graph, graph database, and graph visualization, and offers recommendations based on the authors’ experience in developing three knowledge graph systems for archive and digital humanities resources: the Zubir Said personal archive collection at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, Singapore; Singapore Pioneers social network; and Polyglot Medicine knowledge graph of Asian traditional and herbal medicine. Lessons learned from a small user study are incorporated in the discussion. © 2024 American Library Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract: Identifying cases of intellectual property violation in multimedia files poses significant challenges for the Internet infrastructure, especially when dealing with extensive document collections. Typically, techniques used to tackle such issues can be categorized into either of two groups: proactive and reactive approaches. This article introduces an approach combining both proactive and reactive solutions to remove illegal uploads on a platform while preventing legal uploads or modified versions of audio tracks, such as parodies, remixes or further types of edits. To achieve this, we have developed a rule-based focused crawler specifically designed to detect copyright infringement on audio files coupled with a visualization environment that maps the retrieved data on a knowledge graph to represent information extracted from audio files. Our system automatically scans multimedia files that are uploaded to a public collection when a user submits a search query, performing an audio information retrieval task only on files deemed legal. We present experimental results obtained from tests conducted by performing user queries on a large music collection, a subset of 25,000 songs and audio snippets obtained from the Free Music Archive library. The returned audio tracks have an associated Similarity Score, a metric we use to determine the quality of the adversarial searches executed by the system. We then proceed with discussing the effectiveness and efficiency of different settings of our proposed system. Graphical abstract: (Figure presented.) © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - In the globalization trend, China’s cultural heritage is in danger of gradually disappearing. The protection and inheritance of these precious cultural resources has become a critical task. This paper focuses on the Miao batik culture in Guizhou Province, China, and explores the application of knowledge graphs, natural language processing, and deep learning techniques in the promotion and protection of batik culture. We propose a dual-channel mechanism that integrates semantic and visual information, aiming to connect batik pattern features with cultural connotations. First, we use natural language processing techniques to automatically extract batik-related entities and relationships from the literature, and construct and visualize a structured batik pattern knowledge graph. Based on this knowledge graph, users can textually search and understand the images, meanings, taboos, and other cultural information of specific patterns. Second, for the batik pattern classification, we propose an improved ResNet34 model. By embedding average pooling and convolutional operations into the residual blocks and introducing long-range residual connections, the classification performance is enhanced. By inputting pattern images into this model, their categories can be accurately identified, and then the underlying cultural connotations can be understood. Experimental results show that our model outperforms other mainstream models in evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, achieving 94.46%, 94.47%, 93.62%, and 93.8%, respectively. This research provides new ideas for the digital protection of batik culture and demonstrates the great potential of artificial intelligence technology in cultural heritage protection. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The vision-and-language navigation (VLN) task necessitates an agent to perceive the surroundings, follow natural language instructions, and act in photo-realistic unseen environments. Most of the existing methods employ the entire image or object features to represent navigable viewpoints. However, these representations are insufficient for proper action prediction, especially for the REVERIE task, which uses concise high-level instructions, such as "Bring me the blue cushion in the master bedroom". To address enhancing representation, we propose an augmented commonsense knowledge model (ACK) to leverage commonsense information as a spatio-temporal knowledge graph for improving agent navigation. Specifically, the proposed approach involves constructing a knowledge base by retrieving commonsense information from ConceptNet, followed by a refinement module to remove noisy and irrelevant knowledge. We further present ACK which consists of knowledge graph-aware cross-modal and concept aggregation modules to enhance visual representation and visual-textual data alignment by integrating visible objects, commonsense knowledge, and concept history, which includes object and knowledge temporal information. Moreover, we add a new pipeline for the commonsensebased decision-making process which leads to more accurate local action prediction. Experimental results demonstrate our proposed model noticeably outperforms the baseline and archives the state-of-the-art on the REVERIE benchmark.

AB  - Tourism knowledge graphs lack cultural content, limiting their usefulness for cultural tourists.This paper presents the development of a cultural perspective-based knowledge graph (CuPe-KG). We evaluated fine-tuning ERNIE 3.0 (FT-ERNIE) and ChatGPT for cultural type recognition to strengthen the relationship between tourism resources and cultures. Our investigation used an annotated cultural tourism resource dataset containing 2,745 items across 16 cultural types. The results showed accuracy scores for FT-ERNIE and ChatGPT of 0.81 and 0.12, respectively, with FT-ERNIE achieving a micro-F1 score of 0.93, a 26 percentage point lead over ChatGPT's score of 0.67. These underscore FT-ERNIE's superior performance (the shortcoming is the need to annotate data) while highlighting ChatGPT's limitations because of insufficient Chinese training data and lower identification accuracy in professional knowledge. A novel ontology was designed to facilitate the construction of CuPe-KG, including elements such as cultural types, historical figures, events, and intangible cultural heritage. CuPe-KG effectively addresses cultural tourism visitors’ information retrieval needs. © 2024

AB  - [Purpose/Significance] The development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has brought huge changes and opportunities to library knowledge services. With the improvement of the multimodal capabilities of large language models, the ability of generative artificial intelligence to generate cultural images, cultural audio, and cultural video will also improve, which will effectively promote the intelligent transformation of library knowledge services and support the innovation of library knowledge services. General AI has stronger generalization ability, which can achieve functions such as complex task understanding, multimodal data learning, zero-sample reasoning, and continuous dialogue, completing the transformation from data-driven AI to natural mechanism-driven AI. By studying the theoretical foundation, system framework and application perspective of knowledge services based on artificial general intelligence, we can get new research ideas and practical references for knowledge services. [Method/ Process] Based on the classification of the development history of AI, this article examines the state of research in AI for library knowledge services from the dynamic perspective of the evolution from generative AI to artificial general intelligence. This article analyzes the system framework of library knowledge services constructed with generative artificial intelligence and artificial general intelligence as technical bases, and explores the future development trend of library knowledge services based on artificial general intelligence from the aspects of space, content, mechanism and talent. [Results/Conclusions] With the continuous development and optimization of large language model technologies, the gradual implementation and widespread application of artificial general intelligence technology is an inevitable trend in the future. With the promotion of artificial general intelligence, library knowledge services will also undergo significant changes, and the traditional knowledge service model based on existing resources will gradually transform into a digital intelligence service model. Although artificial general intelligence has shown great potential in knowledge understanding and content generation, artificial general intelligence is still at an early stage of development, and its prospects for application in library knowledge services are not yet clear. In order to explore the impact of artificial general intelligence on the library knowledge service model, this article summarizes the different stages of AI technology integration in knowledge services, namely the evolution from automation to cognition and then to autonomy, and proposes an AI agent-driven library knowledge service framework. It is believed that artificial general intelligence technology will open up new development space for library knowledge services, promote academic research and practical applications in knowledge services and enter a new era of rapid development. © 2024 Agricultural Information Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

AB  - In the new era of the vigorous development of digitalization and intelligence, digital technology has widely penetrated various fields. International authoritative standardization bodies, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), proposed a timely new standard concept called Standards Machine Applicable, Readable, and Transferable (SMART) in order to meet this development trend. Its core feature is that the standard can be machine-readable, usable, understandable, and resolvable without human labor so as to achieve the goals of standard formulation, promotion, publicity, and implementation more effectively. Simultaneously, China’s standardization industry is responding to the strategic deployment of “new quality productivity” by actively promoting the digital development of standards and establishing standard information databases, standard formulation management systems, etc., which provide data support and a platform basis for applying new technologies. Advanced technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and knowledge graphs can be combined with standardization to improve the efficiency of standard development, application accuracy, and implementation effects. To align with these trends, this study focuses on analyzing the responses of national and international standards in the field of urban sustainable development to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs). This study proposes an innovative approach involving the application of knowledge graph technology to the standardization of urban sustainable development and establishing a response correlation between the indicator library for cities’ sustainable development (ILCSD) and SDGs. It also provides additional functions, such as the intelligent extraction of cities’ sustainable characteristic evaluation indicators and aided decision analysis, which greatly enhance the practicability and efficiency of the ILCSD as a technical tool. Based on knowledge graphs, this study analyzes the different responses of important standards in the field of urban sustainable development to the 17 SDGs, accurately identifies weak trends and gaps in standards, and provides a basis for improving the standardization system of urban sustainable development. Simultaneously, by comparing national and international standards and technologies, this study promotes the mutual recognition of standards, which can help China’s urban sustainable development work align with international standards. In addition, the process of establishing and maintaining knowledge graphs facilitates the continuous adoption of new standards through which the indicator library is automatically updated. Finally, in this study, we propose several inspirations for the standardization of urban sustainable development in China, such as an optimization standard system of benchmarking SDGs and a localization application of the original SDG indicators. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Historical sites are incomplete relics left by human activities and are also valuable resources for human society, with most of them buried deep underground. Because the protection of original historical sites is difficult, very few sites choose this method. Many funerary objects that have been in historical sites are scattered in museums, losing their original context and complicating their utilization. Thus, using digital technology to protect and utilize historical sites and to explore their outstanding value from historical, aesthetic, and anthropological perspectives is a foremost concern. Therefore, this study aims to develop a comprehensive method for the protection and utilization of historical sites, that is, digital protection and utilization based on a digital twin. We constructed a historical site digital twin model using qualitative and vertical methods, including a physical entity, virtual entity, twin data center, digital twin service, and connection. We also established a technical framework of data acquisition and processing, digital protection, and digital utilization, forming a layered management and application of digital resources. In digital protection, information in the real world and the virtual world are connected to monitor risks, collect data, create simulations, and propose protection strategies, quickly and accurately. In digital utilization, the knowledge graph is constructed to associate seemingly unrelated information, explore potential knowledge, and improve information sharing. In addition, the method is validated by means of case studies of historical sites in China. In this paper, the historical sites of the Northern Qi Dynasty in Taiyuan, Shanxi, especially the Xuxianxiu Tomb and Lourui Tomb, are discussed in detail. The results indicate that this method is effective for the protection and utilization of historical sites. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - As the proliferation of video content continues, and many video archives lack suitable metadata, therefore, video retrieval, particularly through example-based search, has become increasingly crucial. Existing metadata often fails to meet the needs of specific types of searches, especially when videos contain elements from different modalities, such as visual and audio. Consequently, developing video retrieval methods that can handle multi-modal content is essential. In designing our novel video retrieval framework named Multi-modal Video Search by Examples (MVSE)1, we focused on accuracy (precision and recall), efficiency (retrieval time in seconds), interactivity, and extensibility, with key components including advanced data processing and a user-friendly interface aimed at enhancing search effectiveness and user experience. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), the interaction between multimodal data, including image and audio has been transformed with a significant leap forward towards a bigger goal of artificial general intelligence. This workshop aims to bring together experts from diverse domains to explore the possibilities of developing novel ways of multimodal data search, understanding and interaction. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - In this work, we present a method for personalizing human-robot interaction by using emotive facial expressions to generate affective robot movements. Movement is an important medium for robots to communicate affective states, but the expertise and time required to craft new robot movements promotes a reliance on fixed preprogrammed behaviors. Enabling robots to respond to multimodal user input with newly generated movements could stave off staleness of interaction and convey a deeper degree of affective understanding than current retrieval-based methods. We use autoencoder neural networks to compress robot movement data and facial expression images into a shared latent embedding space. Then, we use a reconstruction loss to generate movements from these embeddings and triplet loss to align the embeddings by emotion classes rather than data modality. To subjectively evaluate our method, we conducted a user survey and found that generated happy and sad movements could be matched to their source face images. However, angry movements were most often mismatched to sad images. This multimodal data-driven generative method can expand an interactive agent’s behavior library and could be adopted for other multimodal affective applications. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)

AB  - With the growth of the Web3 domain, there has been a significant rise of third-party software packages. These range from basic blockchain interaction tools and contract development aids to front-end development packages for Decentralized Applications (DApps), with the diversity and inter-dependencies of these packages continuing to grow. However, despite these advancements, the security of these packages has not kept pace, highlighted by several significant Web3 supply chain attacks. It underscored the urgent need for a deeper understanding of the Web3 third-party library supply chain. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the Web3 third-party package supply chain using knowledge graphs, which detail the structure, themes, and evolving dynamics within this domain. Further, we analyze the characteristics of vulnerabilities and their propagation through knowledge graphs in the Web3 ecosystem. We also extend our findings to practical applications, providing valuable insights for Web3 community stakeholders and creating an extensive dataset that includes 695,642 versions of Web3 packages and 270,217,326 dependency links. This research is aimed at reinforcing the foundation of Web3 development, promoting enhanced security practices, and supporting informed decision-making within the DApp landscape. © 2024 ACM.

AB  - This paper explores the impact of emerging technologies, with a particular focus on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), within the museum experience. Analysing various case studies highlights the potential of BCIs in visual communication design to personalise the interaction between the visitor and artwork, making experiences more engaging and meaningful. To overcome the limitations of current approaches, the paper proposes a reflection on an integrated model that combines neuroscience, design, and the humanities, centred on the individual and their interaction with the environment. This interdisciplinary approach, which lacks established design traditions in Visual Communication for Cultural Heritage, aims to offer new research perspectives to enhance individual perceptions during multisensory experiences of cultural heritage. © 2024, Universita di Palermo.

AB  - This paper reviews the potential of gamified cultural heritage in immersive virtual exhibitions. A systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines identified 78 relevant papers from ACM and IEEE databases. Gamification and immersive technologies can provide interactive experiences to engage visitors and enhance their understanding of exhibits’ historical and cultural significance. Theoretical frameworks, including gamification theory, heritage interpretation theory, participatory heritage, immersive experience theory, and pedagogy, guide designing compelling experiences. Case studies like “Rome Reborn”, “Sutton House Stories”, and “Assassin's Creed: Origins” demonstrate the efficacy of gamification in disseminating heritage. Key strategies include integrating augmented/virtual reality, multimodal data and 3D reconstruction, interactive narratives and gameplay, personalized experiences, advanced interfaces, balancing education and entertainment, and ensuring cultural sensitivity. Future work can explore AI-adaptive experiences, AR/VR integration, remote collaboration, educational game elements, and digital creativity models. Gamification and immersion provide innovative preservation and inheritance of cultural heritage. This review promotes digitalization and identifies literature gaps, supporting reflection on engagement's past, present, and future. It aims to enable a broader appreciation of cultural heritage through technology. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - In this work, we present a new molecular de novo design approach which utilizes a knowledge graph encoding chemical reactions, extracted from the publicly available USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office) dataset. Our proposed method can be used to expand the chemical space by performing forward synthesis prediction by finding new combinations of reactants in the knowledge graph and can in this way generate libraries of de novo compounds along with a valid synthetic route. The forward synthesis prediction of novel compounds involves two steps. In the first step, a graph neural network-based link prediction model is used to suggest pairs of existing reactant nodes in the graph that are likely to react. In the second step, product prediction is performed using a molecular transformer model to obtain the potential products for the suggested reactant pairs. We achieve a ROC-AUC score of 0.861 for link prediction in the knowledge graph and for the product prediction, a top-1 accuracy of 0.924. The method's utility is demonstrated by generating a set of de novo compounds by predicting high probability reactions in the USPTO. The generated compounds are diverse in nature and many exhibit drug-like properties. A brief comparison with a template-based library design is provided. Furthermore, evaluation of the potential activity using a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model suggested the presence of potential dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) modulators among the proposed compounds. In summary, our results suggest that the proposed method can expand the easily accessible chemical space, by combining known compounds, and identify novel drug-like compounds for a specific targetr. © 2024 RSC.

AB  - In this paper we present TelarKG, a knowledge graph (KG) that consolidates multiple sources of information regarding the Chilean Constitutional process, particularly about the work of the members of the Constitutional Convention. TelarKG contains a wide range of public data, such as the materials from the commissions and information about the members' interventions and votes. In addition, the KG has been enriched with online user-generated content including posts from social networks related to the constitutional process, and transcriptions from the YouTube videos of the plenary sessions. Among other features, TelarKG leverages the semantic similarity search capabilities of the MillenniumDB endpoint to compute text similarity among convention members' Twitter messages. Additionally, we employ Entity Linking techniques to identify references to members of the Convention and Parties within these messages. TelarKG constitutes one of the most comprehensive historical archives on a political event, enabling users to query and navigate through diverse aspects of Chile's constitutional process.

AB  - The heritage science sector is facing a critical need for accessible and comprehensive data resources to facilitate research, preservation efforts, and interdisciplinary collaboration. The concept of FAIR data management involves embracing principles and practices that ensure that data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. This work presents an overview of the latest updates on the INFRA-ART Spectral Library, an open access spectral database of cultural-heritage-related materials that was designed as a digital support tool for heritage research specialists that work with (portable) non- or minimally invasive spectroscopic techniques such as X-ray fluorescence (XRF), attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, or Raman spectroscopy, among others. The database is an ongoing compilation of high-quality curated data that currently incorporates primary ATR-FTIR and XRF spectra and a preliminary dataset of Raman and short-wave infrared (SWIR) reflectance spectra on over 900 different materials typically found in painted works of art. For increased and sustainable accessibility, the database follows the European Commission’s recommendations on access to scientific information, as well as the FAIR guiding principles on research data that result from publicly funded research. The INFRA-ART Spectral Library is registered as a resource within the Open Science Cloud (EOSC) Portal and is among the services offered by the Romanian hub within E-RIHS (European Research Infrastructure for Heritage Science) DIGILAB. © 2024 by the author.

AB  - Archives that house digital collections often struggle with rapidly evolving workflows and the intrinsic difficulties in managing disordered records. Both physical and digital records may have complex relationships with other records such as drafts of the same document or one document that is included in another, but digital records offer the possibility that a computer may analyze the collection and automatically discover such relationships. An analytical tool for digital collections would employ a model that can represent the network of relationships between files instead of the hierarchical model used in traditional archival arrangement and description. A proof-of-concept of such a tool, employing techniques such as fuzzy and perceptual hashes, demonstrates the viability of this approach and suggests avenues for future research and development.  © 2024 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - In response to the problems of over-reliance on manual experience and low defect disposal efficiency of traditional transformer maintenance mode, the paper proposes a risk assessment and auxiliary maintenance decision method based on defect text recognition and knowledge graph for transformer. By establishing the defect text recognition model based on Bert-CNN, the method completes the dynamic word vector extraction and text local feature analysis of the defect records filled in by operation personnel, and automatically evaluates the severity and risk level of equipment defects. Then, based on industrial standards, operation specifications and expert experiences, knowledge graph is used to construct the operation and maintenance strategy library of transformer, which realizes the knowledge fusion and mapping of defect text recognition results and maintenance strategy library. The intelligent operation-inspection auxiliary function of the whole process from equipment defect record to operation and maintenance decision-making is improved. Finally, combined with algorithm comparison and case verification, the accuracy of the method to identify the defect severity, component and risk level is higher than 91%, and decision-making on differentiated maintenance and suggestion based on equipment defect conditions is realized, which helps to improve the intelligence and automation level of transformer operation and maintenance. © 2024 Science Press.

AB  - To improve the efficiency and intelligence level of an archive management system (AMS) in multimodal data processing, this study proposes and designs an intelligent AMS based on deep learning (DL). However, the traditional AMS faces problems, such as inaccurate data classification, low query efficiency, long response delay, and insufficient system expansibility, when dealing with massive multimodal data. To address these issues, mainstream DL models such as Decoding-Enhanced Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers with Disentangled Attention (DeBERTa), Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), and Swin Transformer are compared with the proposed optimized models. The optimized model's performance improvement in multimodal archive management tasks has been validated through multidimensional experimental assessments. In comprehensive performance comparison experiments, the optimized model demonstrates excellent performance across several key metrics, including resource consumption, response time, data processing throughput, query efficiency, and fault recovery capability. For instance, the optimized model's response time in text processing tasks is 98.367 milliseconds (ms), significantly lower than the Swin Transformer's 156.234 ms. Regarding audio processing tasks, the optimized model's resource consumption is only 4.387 GigaByte (GB), markedly lower than DeBERTa's 6.823 GB. Furthermore, in terms of user satisfaction, the proposed model scores as high as 9.238 in text processing, indicating an enhancement in the user experience. Through effectiveness evaluation experiments, this study further confirms the superiority of the optimized model in terms of accuracy, processing delay, self-learning ability, error rate, security assessment, and system scalability. Moreover, the optimized model achieves an accuracy of 94.23% in text processing, nearly 4% higher than DeBERTa, and reduces the error rate in audio processing to 3.78%, showing greater stability and reliability. Therefore, this study provides new solutions for AMS in the fields of multimodal data processing and intelligent management, especially in enhancing system performance, optimizing user experience, and strengthening system security and scalability.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Network security policy is regarded as a guideline for the use and management of the network environment, which usually formulates various requirements in the form of natural language. It can help network managers conduct standardized network attack detection and situation awareness analysis in the overall time and space environment of network security. However, in most cases, due to configuration updates or policy conflicts, there are often differences between the real network environment and network security policies. In this case, the consistency detection of network security policies is necessary. The previous consistency detection methods of security policies have some problems. Firstly, the detection direction is single, only focusing on formal reasoning methods to achieve logical consistency detection and solve problems. Secondly, the detection policy field is not comprehensive, focusing only on a certain type of problem in a certain field. Thirdly, there are numerous forms of data structures used for consistency detection, and it is difficult to unify the structured processing and analysis of rule library carriers and target information carriers. With the development of intelligent graph and data mining technology, the above problems have the possibility of optimization. This article proposes a new consistency detection approach for network security policy, which uses an intelligent graph database as a visual information carrier, which can widely connect detection information and achieve comprehensive detection across knowledge domains, physical devices, and detection methods. At the same time, it can also help users grasp the security associations with the real network environment based on the graph algorithm of the knowledge graph and intelligent reasoning. Furthermore, these actual network situations and knowledge bases can help managers improve policies more tailored to local conditions. This article also introduces the consistency detection process of typical cases of network security policies, demonstrating the practical details and effectiveness of this method. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The Semantic Web had a significant impact on the GLAM domain, where the need to connect knowledge has grown so important that it has sparked numerous crowdsourcing initiatives and collaborative native Linked Open Data cataloguing projects. One of the key challenges in facing these collaborative activities is the heterogeneity of content and levels of expertise among users. While existing solutions can meet several important requirements, developing new features is often affected by the practical use of such platforms in real-world work settings. This article explores novel demands and presents the solution proposed by CLEF 2.0, the native Linked Open Data cataloguing software adopted in various case studies concerning the description of Italian Digital Cultural Heritage. © 2025, The Author(s).

AB  - Nanjing Yunjin, a traditional Chinese silk weaving craft, is celebrated globally for its unique local characteristics and exquisite workmanship, forming an integral part of the world's intangible cultural heritage. However, with the advancement of information technology, the experiential knowledge of the Nanjing Yunjin production process is predominantly stored in text format. As a highly specialized and vertical domain, this information is not readily convert into usable data. Previous studies on a knowledge graph-based Nanjing Yunjin Question-Answering System have partially addressed this issue. However, knowledge graphs need to be constantly updated and rely on predefined entities and relationship types. Faced with ambiguous or complex natural language problems, knowledge graph information retrieval faces some challenges. Therefore, this study proposes a Nanjing Yunjin Question-Answering System that integrates Knowledge Graphs and Retrieval Augmented Generation techniques. In this system, the ROBERTA model is first utilized to vectorize Nanjing Yunjin textual information, delving deep into textual semantics to unveil its profound cultural connotations. Additionally, the FAISS vector database is employed for efficient storage and retrieval of Nanjing Yunjin information, achieving a deep semantic match between questions and answers. Ultimately, related retrieval results are fed into the Large Language Model for enhanced generation, aiming for more accurate text generation outcomes and improving the interpretability and logic of the Question-Answering System. This research merges technologies like text embedding, vectorized retrieval, and natural language generation, aiming to overcome the limitations of knowledge graphs-based Question-Answering System in terms of graph updating, dependency on predefined types, and semantic understanding. System implementation and testing have shown that the Nanjing Yunjin Intelligent Question-Answering System, constructed on the basis of Knowledge Graphs and Retrieval Augmented Generation, possesses a broader knowledge base that considers context, resolving issues of polysemy, vague language, and sentence ambiguity, and efficiently and accurately generates answers to natural language queries. This significantly facilitates the retrieval and utilization of Yunjin knowledge, providing a paradigm for constructing Question-Answering System for other intangible cultural heritages, and holds substantial theoretical and practical significance for the deep exploration and discovery of the knowledge structure of human intangible heritage, promoting cultural inheritance and protection. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Oral historical archive resources are an emerging archive resource with the rapid development of modern technology. Its”bottom-up” approach to historical research has received widespread attention in the fields of history, archives, and libraries. Under the common knowledge discovery mode, oral historical archives resources are showing a dispersed state. Information technology represented by knowledge graphs can break through the data solidification of oral historical archives, reshape the information stack of oral historical archives, and achieve knowledge association and aggregation of oral historical archive resources. The article attempts to construct a knowledge graph of the oral historical archives resources on the theme of”science and art” in the collection of T.D. Lee Library of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. It uses Large Language Model - Retrieval Augmented Generation (LLM-RAG) for knowledge extraction, and then uses a semantic model for knowledge organization and management. The article attempts to empower humanities with technology, exploring the possibility of combining”digital technology” and”humanities research”, extending traditional humanities research methods, breaking down barriers between technology and humanities resources, and providing a new path reference for revealing resource content characteristics, semantic deep correlation, and multi-dimensional knowledge discovery. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Ontologies constitute the semantic model of Knowledge Graphs (KGs). This structural association indicates the potential existence of methodological analogies in the development of ontologies and KGs. The deployment of fully and well-defined methodologies for KG development based on existing ontology engineering methodologies (OEMs) has been suggested and efficiently applied. However, most of the modern/recent OEMs may not include tasks that (i) empower knowledge workers and domain experts to closely collaborate with ontology engineers and KG specialists for the development and maintenance of KGs, (ii) satisfy special requirements of KG development, such as (a) ensuring modularity and agility of KGs, (b) assessing and mitigating bias at schema and data levels. Toward this aim, the paper presents a methodology for the Collaborative and Hybrid Engineering of Knowledge Graphs (CHEKG), which constitutes a hybrid (schema-centric/top-down and data-driven/bottom-up), collaborative, agile, and iterative approach for developing modular and fair domain-specific KGs. CHEKG contributes to all phases of the KG engineering lifecycle: from the specification of a KG to its exploitation, evaluation, and refinement. The CHEKG methodology is based on the main phases of the extended Human-Centered Collaborative Ontology Engineering Methodology (ext-HCOME), while it adjusts and expands the individual processes and tasks of each phase according to the specialized requirements of KG development. Apart from the presentation of the methodology per se, the paper presents recent work regarding the deployment and evaluation of the CHEKG methodology for the engineering of semantic trajectories as KGs generated from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) data during real cultural heritage documentation scenarios. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - In this article, we present our path towards building knowledge graphs automatically from Russian texts. We explore various methodologies and libraries to extract triples, which are the fundamental building blocks of knowledge graphs. Our approach involves the use of libraries for analyzing morphological characteristics of words, such as PyMorphy and Yandex Mystem, to construct triples. We also utilize the NLP library spaCy to analyze text and build triples based on semantic relationships recognized by the library. However, we found that in some cases, we could not extract relationships from the text, leading us to use word2vec to define relationships. Unfortunately, the results obtained from word2vec were unsatisfactory and could not be used as relationships. We also encountered the problem of building triples from text due to the use of pronouns. To address this issue, we explored the use of coreference resolution libraries, but unfortunately, there are no working libraries available for the Russian language at this time. Our results highlight both positive and negative outcomes of applying these methodologies and libraries, providing insights into the challenges and opportunities of building knowledge graphs automatically from Russian texts.  © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

AB  - As the production orders are becoming multi-category and small-batch in the era of product personalization, these require frequent reconfiguration of reconfigurable flexible assembly system for cross-category products (RFAS-CCP). However, there is no suitable theoretical assembly model and systematic implementation framework. We first propose a five-element assembly model (FAM) for RFAS-CCP, i.e. product, process, resource, knowledge, and decision. The product, process, and resource element describe the objects, steps to be assembled, and the tools, fixtures, and other equipment used for assembly, respectively. The knowledge element is a form representation of various heterogeneous data, such as a knowledge graph. The decision element includes various assembly methods to achieve assembly automation, flexibility, and intelligence. Then, in order to standardize and easy the frequent reconfiguration process, we reorganize various decision methods into a three-phase systematic implementation framework according to which stage they are used: design, configuration, and operation phases. The design phase methods primarily design various assembly modules for a product family, forming an assembly resource library. The configuration phase methods primarily configure suitable assembly lines for a specific product in the product family. The operation phase methods monitor the status of the assembly line and ensures its stable operation through health management. Finally, the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed five-element assembly model and three-phase systematic implementation framework are experimented with a pressure reducing valve product. © 2024 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers

AB  - Archival repositories contain vast amounts of historical data within unstructured textual documents, posing significant challenges for extracting coherent insights. This paper presents ongoing work towards an optimised workflow for constructing a knowledge graph from millions of archival records related to the “Wiedergutmachung” process in Germany. These records, documenting compensation and restitution efforts following World War II, offer insights into the aftermath of the National Socialist regime. The proposed workflow involves converting document images to machine-readable formats, ontology design, information extraction, and entity linking. Leveraging both traditional methods and transformer-based technologies, the workflow addresses unique challenges inherent in historical documents. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Dunhuang is a unique art treasure and a world heritage site. In order to organise and manage Dunhuang cultural heritage resources, this article studies the classification of Dunhuang murals in different dynasties, and explores the topic distribution characteristics and evolution rules of them. First, image features are extracted through scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) and Canny and scale-invariant feature transform (CSIFT), a visual dictionary is generated through the k-means clustering algorithm, and the term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) vector is calculated and combined with the colour feature vector extracted via hue, saturation and value (HSV). Second, Dunhuang mural images are collected and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier is built. Finally, the knowledge graph-based topic maps are constructed, and graph theory is introduced to analyse the topic distribution and evolution of Dunhuang murals in different dynasties. The results show that the Dunhuang murals of different dynasties can be effectively classified through the bag of words, HSV and support vector machine (BOW_HSV_SVM) based on their visual features. Through topic maps, the topic distribution characteristics and evolution rules of Dunhuang murals with the dynasties are revealed. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Autobiographical writings are invaluable for research, offering relevant insights into personal experiences and cultural contexts. This is particularly true for Italian actresses, whose autobiographies, while rich with information, have been relatively underexplored in academic research. The Women Writing around the Camera (WOW) project addresses this gap by developing a semantic portal dedicated to these autobiographical texts. The WOW portal will reveal the dynamics between the actresses' writings, their private lives, their artistic careers, and the cultivation of the diva image. As a first step towards this goal, this paper presents the WOW knowledge graph (KG), which maps the personal and professional networks related to the divas' lives. The KG was built starting from the actresses' autobiographies, guided by a taxonomy of themes curated by domain experts. Although still under development and expansion, the KG provides a solid foundation for future enhancements. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - This paper addresses the visualization challenges posed by Mini Challenge 3 of the VAST Challenge 2024, which involves detecting illegal fishing activities within a dynamic network of companies and individuals. The task requires effective anomaly detection in a timedependent knowledge graph, a scenario where conventional graph visualization tools often fall short due to their limited ability to integrate temporal data and the undefined nature of the anomalies. We demonstrate how to overcome these challenges through wellcrafted views implemented in standard software libraries. Our approach involves decomposing the time-dependent knowledge graph into separate time and structure components, as well as providing data-driven guidance for identifying anomalies. These components are then interconnected through extensive interactivity, enabling exploration of anomalies in a complex, temporally evolving network. The source code and a demonstration video are publicly available at github.com/MaAllma/Temporal_Knowledge_Graph_Analysis. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - We demonstrate MedHunter, a system for assisting the early stage of drug development. MedHunter builds a biomedical knowledge graph DDKG by integrating data from eleven biochemical libraries and data banks, and aligning entities from different data sources by means of heterogeneous entity resolution. It identifies drugdisease associations and protein-protein interactions in DDKG by employing graph association rules (GARs). GARs use graph patterns to extract relevant entities and embed ML models as predicates. MedHunter discovers GARs from DDKG and incrementally enriches DDKG with external data; it cleans DDKG with a special form of GARs. We demonstrate MedHunter for its (a) interfaces, (b) data enrichment/cleaning, and (c) applications in target identification, drug-drug interaction and protein-protein interaction. © 2024, VLDB Endowment.

AB  - In order to construct a knowledge graph of Hainan marine intangible cultural heritage, this paper designs the graph database by setting the annotation system and semantic structure of the intangible heritage metadata. For the named entity recognition of the knowledge graph, a model combining long and short-term memory neural networks and Bi-Lstm-CRF with conditional random field is established. The recognized entities are processed based on the Bert pre-training model, and the semantic relations are extracted by combining the cluster search method. Compared with other models, the accuracy rate of the Bs-Spert model for the extraction of semantic relations of the Hainan marine NRM dataset is improved by 0.64%, 0.85% and 0.98% compared with GCNRE, Match Blank and MTDS, respectively. Meanwhile, other metrics of the Bs-Spert model also performed well, with a recall rate of 82.26% and an F1-value of 74.01%. By constructing a knowledge map based on the graph database, we can analyze the current situation of Hainan’s marine NRM more comprehensively and thus propose corresponding countermeasures. © 2023 Qiongfei Deng, published by Sciendo.

AB  - Regional poetry is an important part of Chinese intangible cultural heritage; a characteristic example is the poetry of the Hexi Corridor, an important historical region with a rich poetry tradition located in the modern western Gansu province of China. In this paper, we present our work on an ontology-based model for Hexi regional poetry that captures historical and cultural information including poetic imageries and allusions, based on CIDOC-CRM and other standard Semantic Web ontologies. Our work lays the foundation for transforming digitised poetry into a knowledge graph and facilitating the research of the history and culture of the Hexi region. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Aiming at the shortcomings of traditional system evaluation methods that rely too much on the subjective opinions in the construction of an evaluation indicator system and weight distribution, this article utilizes the similarity between the structure of analytic network process (ANP) and the structure of knowledge graph to proposes a strengthened analytic network process method based on knowledge graph. This method adopts prior knowledge to enhance the completeness and objectivity of the evaluation. Firstly, the text data related to the evaluation task is collected to establish the knowledge graph which is the indicator library of the network layer. Secondly, the control layer of the analytic network process that includes the evaluation objective and the evaluation criteria is determined according to the evaluation task. The network layer is constructed by searching for suitable indicators in the network layer indicator library according to the control layer. Thirdly, the similarity between the indicators and the criteria is adopted as the objective standard to adjust the relative importance of the indicators. Through the analytic network process, the weight of each indicator is calculated to complete the system evaluation based on the scrore of each indicator. Finally, the results of the application cases verify that the proposed method has effectiveness, advanced nature and universality. © 2024 Northeast University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Knowledge graphs (KGs) enable researchers to understand a set of data within a domain of research and how different aspects of the data may connect. The methodology used to design and develop a KG varies depending on the use case. When designing a schema for a KG, also called an ontology, the developers can describe data in a rich or shallow manner. A shallow approach has uses for when there is no significant data to describe with data values, whereas a rich approach more closely mirrors reality by providing layers in the ontology to the data description. In this paper, we examine the impact that the complexity a KG schema has on their corresponding knowledge graph embeddings (KGE), where complexity varies across shallow or rich approaches for entity-to-entity relationships. We utilize the Deep Graph Library on two schemas over the same Wright State University’s CORE Scholar data. Preliminary work has shown that there are indeed differences in performance, but further investigation is needed to determine the causal mechanisms, as well as to perform additional data cleaning. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

AB  - In traditional archive management systems, keyword-based retrieval systems often fail to meet users’ personalized and precise retrieval needs. To solve this problem, a knowledge graph is first constructed using bidirectional long short-term memory networks and conditional random fields and combined with user understanding-based semantic retrieval to obtain an improved personalized retrieval system. The research results show that the improved personalized retrieval system has significantly better retrieval accuracy and recall rate than traditional retrieval systems. The improved personalized retrieval system has retrieval accuracy rates of 90.24%, 89.65%, 87.52%, 96.33%, and 95.18% for students, civil servants, demobilized soldiers, law enforcement personnel, and retirees, respectively, and recall rates of 89.35%, 91.57%, 89.34%, 97.54%, and 96.63%, respectively. Applying it to the smart archive management system, the accuracy of archive retrieval, personalized recommendation accuracy, response time, and user satisfaction are significantly better than conventional management systems. The improvement and introduction of personalized retrieval systems based on user understanding and knowledge graphs have achieved significant results. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

AB  - This chapter constructs an end‐to‐end wireless semantic communication framework suitable for image data, aiming to improve the performance of semantic‐driven wireless networks. The framework uses knowledge graphs instead of feature vectors to represent semantics, not only capturing the meaning of entities and complex relationships but also considering individual preferences and background knowledge, ensuring the accuracy and interpretability of semantic expression. To solve the problem that the neural network structure of traditional source‐channel coding cannot reflect the interference of physical noise on the semantic level, this chapter innovatively proposes the transformation theory of semantic domain to the spatial domain, projecting the knowledge graph onto a three‐dimensional tensor in the spatial domain. By mapping the entity's semantic ambiguity with the intensity of discrete points, the knowledge graph is reconstructed from background knowledge libraries and three‐dimensional tensors at the receiving end. Additionally, this chapter proposes a graph‐to‐graph semantic similarity (GGSS) metric based on graph optimal transport theory to evaluate the similarity of semantic information before and after transmission, as well as a semantic‐level image‐to‐image semantic similarity (IISS) metric that aligns with human perception. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of the framework through simulations. © 2025 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Intangible cultural heritage is a valuable resource of human civilization, history and culture. The use of ontology technology can realize the digital management of intangible cultural heritage resources, which is conducive to the protection, utilization and sharing of intangible cultural heritage resources. The ontology framework based on CIDOC CRM for preservation of cultural relics is firstly used in the intangible cultural heritage of building construction techniques for Chinese traditional wooden structure architecture. CIDOC CRM is extended according to the characteristics of the architectural field to define the ontological concept classes and attributes of intangible cultural heritage knowledge in the field. In the process of instantiation, the algorithm of TextRank is used to process text corpus to expand ontology instances. Finally, the ontology model is mapped and it is stored in Neo4j diagram database to realize the visual display in the form of knowledge graph. The results show that the ontology model of traditional architectural intangible cultural heritage knowledge constructed using the above methods is practicable, which can effectively connect various fragmented knowledge. The constructed ontology can be used for knowledge management and will play an important role in the digital protection and rational utilization of intangible cultural heritage in the architectural field. © 2024 Chinese Journal of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine Co., Ltd..

AB  - The methodologies of Cultural Heritage research and in particular those related to conservation and the analytical study of heritage assets and works of art, recently grouped under the term Heritage Sciences, engage a broad range of disciplines, each with its own characteristic workflows for generating data. Consequently, an emerging challenge is the need to define a digital framework for multi-source data integration, associated with a single heritage asset, but generated by various tools and methods which are often pursued by different research groups and at different times. This digital framework is discussed in this essay as the digital twin of a heritage asset, comprising of the documentation data associated with a heritage asset and its virtual representation. To best describe and define a Heritage Digital Twin ontology and its associated knowledge graph, we use a specific example drawing from art historical and analytical investigation of a 13th century Italian painting masterpiece, the Crucifixion of Christ, by Giovanni Baronzio, one of the leaders of the so-called Rimini School of painting which was greatly influenced by the work of the famous Renaissance master Giotto di Bondone. © 2023 Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR)

AB  - Intelligent stations have adopted optical fibers to transmit digital and analog signals, making the theory of secondary safety measures based on the “short current, off voltage, and split trip” method no longer suitable for such stations. To solve the problems of low efficiency and high error rate in traditional manual ticket preparation methods, an automatic generation technology of secondary safety measures based on a knowledge graph and substation configuration description (SCD) files is proposed. First, the technology builds a configuration database based on SCD files and a knowledge graph, and realizes the semi-automatic association between the virtual loop and the soft pressure plate according to the set rules. Second, from the compilation criteria of secondary safety measures in the intelligent station specifications, a safety measure rule library is constructed and the safety measures execution priority coding field is introduced. Finally, the automatic generation technology of secondary safety measures completes the rule matching of maintenance equipment secondary information based on the configuration database and safety measure rule library. This is used to automatically generate secondary safety measure tickets. The simulation results show that this technology can automatically and correctly generate secondary safety measure tickets based on on-site maintenance tasks, improve the efficiency of technical transformation, defect elimination, and verification in intelligent substations, and reduce the error rate of manual compilation. It provides a reference for achieving intelligent operation and inspection integration. © 2024 Power System Protection and Control Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Docker’s rise in CI/CD and software development has introduced notable security vulnerabilities through the complex software packages within Docker images. The swift emergence of new vulnerabilities complicates the security maintenance of these images, further challenged by the vast array of images hosted on Docker Hub. This situation underscores a critical gap in existing security analysis tools, which lack a holistic approach to monitoring and evaluating Docker images’ security status comprehensively. To address this gap, we proposed DocSecKG, an innovative method for developing security knowledge graphs. These graphs effectively illuminate the connections among Docker images, software packages, and vulnerabilities, thereby facilitating a more profound understanding of the Docker ecosystem’s security dynamics. DocSecKG automates the process of tracking, downloading, examining, and updating Docker Hub images, thereby significantly improving the efficiency of security assessments. By applying DocSecKG to Docker Hub’s library images, we uncover pivotal security insights, providing a foundation for actionable intelligence for developers, maintainers, and users. Ultimately, our findings offer a pathway to fortify the Docker ecosystem’s security mechanisms, serving as a valuable resource for subsequent research endeavors. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

AB  - 1. To avoid confusion, all abbreviations “GQL” throughout the text should be standardized as “GraphQL”, and the word “Graph Query Language” in the first sentence of the abstract should be standardized as “Graph + QL (Query Language)”. Also, it should be emphasized that the “Neo4j GraphQL Library” (with Cypher) is one of the necessary components. 2. Due to a typesetting mistake, the title of Section 4.1.2 Spider Dataset should be “4.1.2 Other Datasets used to Test the Effect of the Model”. The original version has been corrected. © 2022, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Throughout the early modern period, the over sixty islands shaping the Venetian lagoon constituted an integral component of Venice’s urban framework. The ERC Starting Grant project Venice’s Nissology (VeNiss) reconstructs this dilapidated cultural heritage site by examining the urban, architectural, and social patterns connecting the capital with its aquascape through a web-based research infrastructure accessible to the broad public. With the idea of understanding and visually narrating the many transformations of Venice’s lagoon settlements over time, this research employs a cutting-edge methodological approach to effectively capture both the physical and functional changes that have occurred to these built works throughout the centuries. Leveraging on the most advanced digital tools (i.e., digital photogrammetric and laser scanner surveys, HGIS mapping, HBIM modelling, and semantic technologies), researchers and the general public alike can explore the material alterations of the islands’ spaces while interactively discovering their historical, socio-economic and cultural changes. This paper proposes an innovative operational methodology that, through a semantic data model and knowledge graph, develops a 3D geospatial and time-based semantic infrastructure. This platform acts as a comprehensive repository that integrates and renders navigable historical data, research findings and 2D and 3D interoperable models, which allows for a nuanced representation of the articulated and long-term relationships that once bonded the cluster of islands with the historical city centre and states across the Italian Peninsula and the Mediterranean. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The EngageAI Institute focuses on AI-driven narrative-centered learning environments that create engaging story-based problem-solving experiences to support collaborative learning. The institute's research has three complementary strands. First, the institute creates narrative-centered learning environments that generate interactive story-based problem scenarios to elicit rich communication, encourage coordination, and spark collaborative creativity. Second, the institute creates virtual embodied conversational agent technologies with multiple modalities for communication (speech, facial expression, gesture, gaze, and posture) to support student learning. Embodied conversational agents are driven by advances in natural language understanding, natural language generation, and computer vision. Third, the institute is creating an innovative multimodal learning analytics framework that analyzes parallel streams of multimodal data derived from students’ conversations, gaze, facial expressions, gesture, and posture as they interact with each other, with teachers, and with embodied conversational agents. Woven throughout the institute's activities is a strong focus on ethics, with an emphasis on creating AI-augmented learning that is deeply informed by considerations of fairness, accountability, transparency, trust, and privacy. The institute emphasizes broad participation and diverse perspectives to ensure that advances in AI-augmented learning address inequities in STEM. The institute brings together a multistate network of universities, diverse K-12 school systems, science museums, and nonprofit partners. Key to all of these endeavors is an emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion. © 2024 The Authors. Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

AB  - The exponential growth of available data to Digital Humanities (DH) has created an impending need for tools capable of analyzing and extracting information from multi-lingual historical documents. This paper explores the research directions of my PhD project: providing DH scholars with effective, efficient, and explainable tools based on recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs). Two are the main directions of investigation: Self-Improving LLMs applied to Text-to-SQL and Topic Modeling, with a focus on interacting with and augmenting existing DBMS; Knowledge Graph (KG) creation and integration to mitigate hallucination, improve transparency and reasoning in question-answering systems. At the heart of my research lies the Digital Maktaba (DM) project which seeks to create a digital library for assisting in the preservation and analysis of multicultural non-latin heritage documents using, among others, cutting edge techniques for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Data Science. The DM objectives and ideals align with the ultimate goal of the PhD project: the creation of instruments capable of aiding human-data interaction and information extraction while keeping the user at the center of an ever-evolving system. These tools have the potential to revolutionize the way DH scholars interact with historical documents, leading to new insights and discoveries for the field at large. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - This work aims to systematically present the complex relationships between multiple entities of Tibetan medicinal materials for treating liver diseases. Based on the binary association relationships of Tibetan medicinal materials' multiple entities, the multi-element relationships were studied among Tibetan medicinal materials-liver diseases-compound formulas. Ontology modeling was performed using data of Tibetan medicinal materials for treating liver diseases, and a knowledge graph and knowledge hypergraph were constructed. The knowledge graph was constructed based on the Neo4j graph database, while the knowledge hypergraph was constructed in the Python environment using the HyperNetX library functions. Binary relationships of Tibetan medicinal materials-ecological information, Tibetan medicinal materials-collection information, and Tibetan medicinal materials-medicinal information are established. A knowledge graph of the entire path from the growth environment to collection and medicinal use of Tibetan medicinal materials was constructed, providing a rapid search path for relevant professionals. The multi-element relationships among were established in Tibetan medicinal materials-liver diseases-compound formulas, which a knowledge hypergraph was constructed based on Tibetan medicinal materials for treating liver diseases. A knowledge chain is established for a comprehensive from the patient's disease to the required compound formula to the Tibetan medicinal materials needed for the formula. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The Guangdong Provincial Archives stores a large volume of valuable historical original Customs archives which are enormous in number and volume, formal in format, various in types and genres, rich in content, providing precious value for such studies as those of Imperial Chinese and foreign exchanges. It has always been the focus of research in the academic world at home and abroad. This paper, characterized by the inputting and outputting relationship among the entities (proper names of people, places, titles, weights and measures) that are most closely related to the translation of Imperial Guangdong Maritime Customs archives, constructs the knowledge graph of Imperial Guangdong Maritime Customs archival translation. In this paper, representative subgraphs being calculated based on the given node sets, a novel archival translation knowledge graph method is proposed, and the spatial components are integrated into the reinforcement learning framework to help understand the knowledge graph of archival translation. Through establishing the Imperial Guangdong Maritime Customs archival translation theory model, the internal structure and external information of archives are analyzed to obtain a more comprehensive and holistic view of the archival translation tasks. At last, the model proposed in this paper is proved to be reasonable by evaluating the data sets of Imperial Guangdong Maritime Customs archives. © 2024 SPIE.

AB  - Iconography and iconology are fundamental domains when it comes to understanding artifacts of cultural heritage (CH). Iconography deals with the study and interpretation of visual elements depicted in artifacts and their symbolism, while iconology delves deeper, exploring the underlying cultural and historical meanings. Despite the advances in representing CH with Linked Open Data (LOD), recent studies show persistent gaps in the representation of iconographic and iconological statements in current knowledge graphs (KGs). To address them, this paper presents IICONGRAPH, a KG that was created by refining and extending the iconographic and iconological statements of ArCo (the Italian KG of CH) and Wikidata. The development of IICONGRAPH was also driven by a series of requirements emerging from research case studies expressed in competency questions (CQs) that were unattainable in the non-reengineered versions of the KGs. The evaluation results demonstrate that IICONGRAPH not only outperforms ArCo and Wikidata through domain-specific assessments from the literature but also serves as a robust platform for answering the formulated CQs. IICONGRAPH is released and documented in accordance with the FAIR principles to guarantee the resource’s reusability. The algorithms used to create it and assess the CQs have also been made available to ensure transparency and reproducibility. While future work focuses on ingesting more data into the KG, and on implementing it as a backbone of LLM-based question answering systems, the current version of IICONGRAPH still emerges as a valuable asset, contributing to the evolving landscape of CH representation within KGs, the Semantic Web, and beyond. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - In response to cybersecurity issues in intelligent connected vehicles, this paper proposes a security event analysis framework based on the fusion of multidimensional heterogeneous data. Multidimensional security event sample library is first built via the integration of automotive security event data from various sources. Moreover, through the application of correlation analysis techniques, security knowledge graphs, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we have achieved effective identification of complex attack behaviors and anomaly detection in actual vehicle network traffic, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of vehicle network security monitoring. In addition, this paper employs knowledge graph visualization techniques to create an intuitive representation of the vehicle’s security status and offer early risk warnings. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

AB  - IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG) publishes cutting-edge research in the fields of visualization, computer graphics, and virtual and augmented realities. Within the TVCG ecosystem, different stakeholders make decisions based on available information related to TVCG almost on a daily basis. The decisions involve various tasks such as the retrieval of research ideas and trends, the invitation of peer reviewers, and the selection of editorial board members, just to name a few. To make well-informed decisions in these contexts, a data-driven approach is necessary. However, the current IEEE digital library only provides access to individual papers. Transforming this wealth of data into valuable insights is a daunting task, requiring specialized expertise and effort in tasks such as data crawling, cleaning, analysis, and visualizations. To address the needs of the community in facilitating more efficient and transparent decision-making, we construct and publicly release a TVCG knowledge graph (TVCG-KG). TVCG-KG is a structured representation of heterogeneous information, including the metadata of each publication such as author, affiliation, title, and semantic information such as method, task, data. Despite the widespread use of KGs in various downstream applications, a noticeable gap exists in the visualization literature regarding the full exploitation of the rich semantics embedded within KGs. While it might seem intuitive to just employ interactive graph-based visualization for KGs, we propose that knowledge discovery over KG is a series of visual exploratory tasks that can benefit from using multiple visualization techniques and designs. We conducted an evaluation of TVCG-KG quality and demonstrated its practical utility through several real-world cases.

AB  - In the context of Modular High-Rise Residential Buildings (MHRBs), designing floor plans involves intricate complexities due to the need for adherence to numerous domain-specific design rules. To address this issue, our research introduces a novel framework based on a Graph-Constrained Generative Adversarial Network (GC-GAN) specialized for generating MHRB floor plans. This enhanced GC-GAN incorporates knowledge graphs that encapsulate domain-specific constraints and guidelines, thereby generating floor plans that exhibit realism, diversity, and conformity to established design principles. Additionally, the framework integrates a sophisticated image-to-vector conversion algorithm that enables seamless alignment with a predefined flat-design standardization library. A salient feature of this framework is the automated generation of Building Information Modeling (BIM) models, which rigorously conform to the modularity specifications essential for efficient modular construction. The efficacy and practical applicability of our approach have been validated through an exhaustive analysis covering fifteen cases across five diverse scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The development of informatization in education has provided the possibility of using resource libraries to enhance English translation courses. Facing this new demand, this paper adopts an entity-based approach to connect multimodal entities with other structured entities, to construct a multimodal knowledge graph for English translation courses in colleges and universities. On this basis, the recommendation model of collaborative filtering is introduced to provide students with personalized English translation exercise recommendation services according to the mastery of knowledge points processed by the knowledge graph. After the model is designed, the knowledge points of the English translation course in a university are firstly extracted physically, and then two classes are selected in the university for controlled experiments. The number of successes in terms of vertical depth strategy is 264, the success rate is 88%, and the success rate of recommendation based on the centrality of knowledge points and contribution value is 94.66%. The mean score of the experimental class was 72.12 and the control class was 67.48. The significant difference in the scores can be confirmed by the fact that the p-value of the independent square root test for the two classes was less than 0.5. English teachers can benefit from this model's assistance in evaluating English translation resources and providing a variety of teaching methods.  © 2024 Yang Yang, published by Sciendo.

AB  - The development of storage standards for databases of different natures and origins makes it possible to aggregate and interact with different data sources in order to obtain and show complex and thematic information to the end user. This article aims to analyze some possibilities opened up by new applications and hypothesize their possible developments. With this work, using the currently available Web technologies, we would like to verify the potential for the use of Linked Open Data in the world of WebGIS and illustrate an application that allows the user to interact with Linked Open Data through their representation on a map. Italy has an artistic and cultural heritage unique in the world and the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism has created and made freely available a dataset in Linked Open Data format that represents it. With the aim of enhancing and making this heritage more usable, the National Research Council (CNR) has created an application that presents this heritage via WebGIS on a map. Following criteria definable by the user, such as the duration, the subject of interest and the style of the trip, tourist itineraries are created through the places that host this heritage. New possibilities open up where the tools made available by the Web can be used together, according to pre-established sequences, to create completely new applications. This can be compared to the use of words, all known in themselves, which, according to pre-established sequences, allow us to create ever new texts. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in organizing large stores of unstructured information into structured formats. This structured information is then accessible through SPARQL queries or graph libraries based on their structure. KGs enhance search, power AI systems, and facilitate knowledge discovery across domains. In this research, we explore the capabilities of different large language models (LLMs) like CodeLlama, Mistral, and Vicuna, which are recognized for text generation, in handling textual information tasks for constructing knowledge graphs with structured data. Utilizing these LLMs, we generate class descriptions for all the classes of well-known KGs like DBpedia, YAGO, and Google Knowledge Graph. Using these class descriptions, we have extracted RDF triples and used different preprocessing techniques for better refinement and extraction of the graph triples from the generated result. These extracted triples are used for the graph ontology creation. Highlighting the contribution of LLMs to structured graph formation, our study includes a comparison of the constructed KGs using the three LLMs with the existing Knowledge Graphs. Later, these KGs are evaluated using six structural quality metrics encompassing both class and property-related information crucial for KG formation. Our insights prove valuable for researchers exploring these domains, offering guidance on overcoming challenges and maximizing the potential of large language models in knowledge graph construction, text generation, and text extraction. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Finding the underlying schema in knowledge graphs is an imperative operation for various tasks, such as query formulation or exploration. This task becomes even harder, when data are incomplete, noisy or are collected via multiple sources with different schemata that are combined. Several algorithms for extracting an implicit schema from a given knowledge graph have been proposed in the literature. However, the lack of a common framework and evaluation metrics makes it difficult to combine them and compare the results. To fill this gap, we present a modular three-stage framework and we have developed a Python library and web application that performs schema extraction and allows users to visually assess and compare the results. The developed tool, called KGSEC, facilitates experimentation and increases interactivity. Given that the quality of a schema is largely subjective, depending on the user's needs and preferences, KGSEC can make it easier and faster for users to generate a schema that is better tailored to their task.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Overcoming the limitations of the record-based approach to library information by graph-based representations driven by ontologies may enable advanced support by AI and allow to expand the realm of the descriptions from the traditional formal metadata in several directions. An application domain that heavily relies on libraries and may take enormous advantage from this approach is education. In fact, an educational ontology is at the core of the KEPLAIR project aimed at developing a learner-centered educational environment. This paper describes our effort in this direction, and specifically how we seamlessly extended a core ontology based on the conceptual models of library data proposed by the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) so that it is aligned with standard educational data models, such as the IEEE LOM, OERschema, and IntelLEO. The alignment resulted in a cross-fertilization of the two domains, and allowed us to better understand them and to find and resolve subtle issues in the aligned resources. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - In order to improve the efficiency of automatic book classification, the study uses a crawler to crawl book data from regular websites and perform data cleaning and fusion to build a structured knowledge graph. Meanwhile, the processed data is applied to a pre-trained model to improve it, and migration learning is used to improve the results. Fusion of Multiple Attention Mechanisms, Recurrent Neural Network, and Convolutional Neural Network modules into the classification model and feature fusion is used to enhance feature extraction. In addition, the study designed a pre-trained model architecture to help automatically categorise and manage book resources. The results of this study show a significant improvement in the classification of Chinese books on the Chinese Book L2 Subject Classification, iFlytek, and THUCNews datasets with significant performance improvement. The fusion of long and short-term memory and convolutional network Transformer-based bidirectional encoding models improved the accuracy by 0.19%, 1.54% and 0.42% on the two datasets, respectively, while the weighted average F1 scores improved accordingly. Through wireless technology, the automatic classification efficiency of books is realized and the management ability of the library is improved. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

AB  - Context: The quality of software systems has always been a crucial task and has led to the establishment of various reputable software quality models. However, the automation trends in Software Engineering have challenged the traditional notion of quality assurance, motivating the development of a new paradigm with advanced AI-based quality standards. Objective: The goal of this paper is to bridge the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical implementations on the aspects of software quality. Methodology: This study involved an extensive literature review of software quality models, including McCall, Boehm, Dromey, FURPS, and ISO/IEC 25010. The detailed information about quality attributes from each model was systematically synthesized and organized into datasets, data frames, and Python dictionaries. The resulting resources were then shared and made accessible through a public GitHub repository. Results: In brief, this research provides (i) a comprehensive dataset on software quality containing catalogs of quality models and attributes, (ii) a Python dictionary encapsulating the quality models and their associated characteristics for convenient empirical experimentation, (iii) the application of advanced knowledge graph techniques for the analysis and visualization of software quality parameters, and (iv) the complete construction steps and resources for download, ensuring easy integration and accessibility. Conclusion: This study builds a foundational step towards the standardization of automating software quality modeling to enhance not just quality but also efficiency for software development. For our future work, there will be a concentration on the practical utilization of the dataset in real-world software development contexts.  © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Detecting fake news problems has been a topic of research noticed in recent years. However, at present, fake news detection research has only been conducted with English data sets, no research has been conducted with Vietnamese datasets. Therefore, it is essentially important and urgent to do research on fake news detection with the Vietnamese dataset. In this research, we proposed a detecting fake news method using a knowledge graph (KG) combined with a semi-supervised learning Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to predict whether the news is real or fake. Our research is implemented by collecting data including real and fake news from the datasets of online newspapers in Vietnamese including vnexpress, tuoitre, etc., and VFND-vietnamese-fake-news. In addition, we will not label news that has not been verified for authenticity. We build a knowledge graph for the dataset by embedding words into the dataset using the Glove library and building a knowledge graph using the Word Mover’s Distance algorithm (WMD) combined with the K-nearest-neighbor algorithm (KNN). Detecting real or fake news models with input knowledge graph built and GCN algorithm and finally perform the tests with datasets. With our research, we have built a knowledge graph for the Vietnamese data set of real and fake news collected from 2018 to 2023 combined with the VFND-vietnamese-fake-news dataset. Our proposed method can resolve to detect fake news problems by the GCN algorithm. Research’s results have a high precision of up to 85%, in the case of labeled data accounting for 50% of the input dataset. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - The Irish civil war in 1922 resulted in the destruction of Ireland’s central archive containing documents dating back seven centuries. A century later, the Virtual Record Treasury of Ireland (VRTI) created a Knowledge Graph (KG) of the recovered historical documents. However, accessing the information in the KG requires the definition of complex and time-consuming SPARQL queries. It was decided to create an application named the VRTI-KG explorer to facilitate searching of the VRTI-KG. The explorer includes customised views which provide natural language descriptions and visualisations of the underlying data in a format to allow non-technical users to easily interpret the information. In addition, the explorer is configurable to allow straightforward synchronisation of changes in the data model into the visualisations on the interface and queries involved in creating them. A user evaluation was conducted with 20 participants to measure the level of satisfaction, understanding and efficiency provided by the explorer. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - In this paper, we present technical implementation details, describe the virtual world procedural generation pipeline, and discuss potential uses in cultural preservation, museum exhibits, and education of HeritageRoots, an innovative software infrastructure designed for preserving indigenous narratives and oral histories. HeritageRoots consists of two interconnected systems - (1) a web-based knowledge graph (KG) data collection and management system which stores, connects, and presents indigenous traditional knowledge (ITK) in the form of narratives, myths, and testimonies from multiple cultures and languages; (2) a virtual environment rendering pipeline which utilizes large language models (LLM), Unity3D, and Meta Quest software development kit (SDK) to procedurally generate virtual worlds from the KG data. Preliminary system evaluation with Ecuadorian Kichwa narratives showed promising results in (1) academic community interest and support, (2) the possibility of developing an infrastructure capable of connecting indigenous narratives with modern scientific knowledge via KGs and (3) procedurally generating virtual worlds from KG. © 2024 Dechema e.V..

AB  - With the development of social economy and the increase of engineering construction projects, a large number of engineering archives of various industries have been constructed. Archives are often scattered across different units and institutions, making it difficult to achieve centralized management and sharing of archives, resulting in prominent problems such as missing and errors while retrieving cross domain engineering archives. Therefore, we propose the Construction and Retrieval Mechanism for Cross Domain Engineering Archives Based on Knowledge Graph (CRM4CDA) for improving retrieval performance. In order to construct a visual knowledge graph for cross domain engineering archives, we combine Protégé tools with Neo4j graph database and integrate fragmented data to build ontology and extract entities for achieving knowledge fusion and integration. In order to improve retrieval performance, we employ semantic analysis, intelligent retrieval, and inference to improve retrieval efficiency. Knowledge association technology and transfer methods are also utilized to promote cross domain retrieval performance. At the same time, various measures are taken to ensure the privacy protection for archive retrieval. Both theoretical analysis and practice have shown that our CRM4CDA mechanism has the characteristics of high retrieval accuracy, recall rate, and efficiency. Further research will be carried out for exploring the deep integration of artificial intelligence and knowledge graphs to further improve the intelligence level of archive management. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Museums, heritage agencies and other institutions responsible for managing archaeological cultural heritage across Europe are engaged in developing digital platforms to better open their collections to the public as a common resource for the purposes of discovering, learning about, and sharing our common past. This paper explores the potential of new semantic computing technologies in democratizing not only public access to digital cultural heritage records, but also to computational and Linked Open Data -assisted data analysis and knowledge discovery. As a case study, we consider archaeological and numismatic Open Data services in Finland, and discuss the research results obtained during the ongoing development work for the CoinSampo framework for opening Finnish and international numismatic data. Existing digital cultural heritage services are often built with the needs of professional collections management in mind. The presentation of the records is typically structured after the familiar format established for the printed catalogues of yesteryear, with few analytical tools that would take advantage of the potential of digital data to probe and visualize internal relationships and patterns within the full body of the opened material. CoinSampo, however, will provide scientific tools to new audiences among the non-professional public who have not enjoyed such a level of access to numismatic data. The broad range of target audiences we envisage includes collections managers, who will benefit from enhanced access to their own data for updating records and for error detection and correction, as well as academic researchers interested in using the material in scientific analysis. Importantly, it also includes non-professional groups such as coin collectors, educators, local historians, and the archaeological hobby metal-detectorists who produce most of the new coin finds entering the national collections in Finland and in other European countries where detecting is legal. By adopting a citizen science and participatory heritage approach in the development of Open Data services, we aim to promote a technological model for cultural heritage dissemination that addresses the needs of a wide spectrum of different user audiences inside and outside the professional sphere. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - High-quality software applications are built on the knowledge and best practices of software engineering. However, there is a huge gap between the theoretical knowledge of software engineering and its practical implementation for software developers, especially beginners of software development. This paper proposes an innovative recommendation service named Wiki2GH to link Wikipedia software engineering knowledge to GitHub frameworks and libraries, aiming to help software developers systematically learn knowledge and apply it into practice. To implement the Wiki2GH recommendation service, this paper first uses the public data of Wikipedia to build a hierarchy software development knowledge catalog as the entrance of the service. Next, we propose a deep learning method to identify frameworks and libraries and construct a knowledge graph of open source software repositories based on dependency graph. Then, we propose a combined application recommendation service of frameworks and libraries in the development practice. The methods proposed in this paper are all evaluated, including the repository type classification method, the recommendation method, and the knowledge graph construction method. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the recommendation service proposed in this paper. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

AB  - Facing the dynamic complex cyber environments, internal and external “cyber threat intelligence” (CTI), and the snowballing risk of cyberattack, knowledge graphs (KGs) show great applicability potential in “cybersecurity” (CS) because of their knowledge aggregation representation, management, and reasoning capabilities. However, while most research has focused on developing a complete knowledge graph, it remains unclear how to apply KGs to solve real challenges in cyberattack and defense scenarios. This chapter briefly overviews the CSKG basic notions, schema, and construction methodologies. A curated collection of datasets and open-source (OO) libraries on the knowledge construction and information extraction task is necessary to foster future CS research KGs. Most of this text compares works that elaborate on the recent progress in “cybersecurity KG” (CSKG) application scenarios. Still, a comprehensive classification framework is created to describe connected results. Finally, there is a thorough look at several promising research directions by discussing existing research flaws. © 2024 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study utilizes Knowledge Graph Attention Network (KGAT) to embed cultural heritage ontology data, thereby creating a recommender system based on the similarity of the heritages. We build a cultural heritage graph using the ontology data and embed all nodes and edges in the graph as vectors. We then make a recommendation result based on the cosine similarity. Also, we propose a method to embed a new cultural heritage using existing embedding vectors without retraining the model, and hence effectively addressing the cold start problem. Experiments demonstrate that our system creates a list of relevant cultural heritages as recommendation and handle new items efficiently without additional training. This method offers a new perspective on cultural heritage, with potential future research integrating user information for more precise recommendations. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Extracting and formally representing the knowledge embedded in textbooks, such as the concepts explained and the relations between them, can support the provision of advanced knowledge-based services for learning environments and digital libraries. In this paper, we consider a specific type of relation in textbooks referred to as prerequisite relations (PR). PRs represent precedence relations between concepts aimed to provide the reader with the knowledge needed to understand a further concept(s). Their annotation in educational texts produces datasets that can be represented as a graph of concepts connected by PRs. However, building good-quality and reliable datasets of PRs from a textbook is still an open issue, not just for automated annotation methods but even for manual annotation. In turn, the lack of good-quality datasets and well-defined criteria to identify PRs affect the development and validation of automated methods for prerequisite identification. As a contribution to this issue, in this paper, we propose PREAP, a protocol for the annotation of prerequisite relations in textbooks aimed at obtaining reliable annotated data that can be shared, compared, and reused in the research community. PREAP defines a novel textbook-driven annotation method aimed to capture the structure of prerequisites underlying the text. The protocol has been evaluated against baseline methods for manual and automatic annotation. The findings show that PREAP enables the creation of prerequisite knowledge graphs that have higher inter-annotator agreement, accuracy, and alignment with text than the baseline methods. This suggests that the protocol is able to accurately capture the PRs expressed in the text. Furthermore, the findings show that the time required to complete the annotation using PREAP are significantly shorter than with the other manual baseline methods. The paper includes also guidelines for using PREAP in three annotation scenarios, experimentally tested. We also provide example datasets and a user interface that we developed to support prerequisite annotation. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Advancing the identification of emerging technology trends is pivotal for informed design decisions and risk mitigation. Our research introduces a novel methodology, centered on technology subgraphs within a patent knowledge graph, utilising graph neural networks combined with data augmentation techniques. This approach deviates from traditional methods, which primarily focus on individual patent nodes or the entire patent network. Instead, it segments the patent knowledge graph into subgraphs, analyzing them based on structural features to identify emerging technologies. Our method is further strengthened by employing an expert-curated emerging technology tag library, enabling a quantitative, rather than solely qualitative, assessment of the subgraphs’ relevance to emerging technologies. Additionally, we integrate comparative learning to enhance subgraph data quality, thereby boosting the reliability and accuracy of our approach. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in the accurate identification of emerging technologies, underscoring the effectiveness of our proposed model. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Rule mining finds patterns in structured data such as knowledge graphs. Rules can predict facts, help correct errors, and yield explainable insights about the data. However, existing rule mining implementations focus exclusively on mining rules - and not on their application. The PyClause library offers a rich toolkit for the application of the mined rules: from explaining facts to predicting links, scoring rules, and deducing query results. The library is easy to use and can handle substantial data loads. © 2024 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper discusses the efforts to make Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Nachlass (a collection of all manuscripts, notes, and typescripts left by the philosopher) accessible through the Semantic Web technology. Starting in the 1990s, the Wittgenstein Archives at the University of Bergen (WAB) digitised the collection, leading to its availability on CD-ROM and later online. Today, several WAB’s web services that facilitate detailed exploration of Wittgenstein’s works are supported by a dedicated OWL knowledge graph called Wittgenstein Ontology. The primary goal of the graph was to represent the whole structure of the Nachlass but WAB also aimed at modelling the philosophical content of Wittgenstein’s writings. However, the latter task proved to be difficult due to the nature of philosophy itself and has not yet been accomplished. The paper presents certain theoretical solutions, the implementation of which will facilitate the integration of the philosophical content of the Nachlass into the existing Wittgenstein Ontology knowledge graph. Furthermore, the paper discusses a proposal for creating a broader system that will allow for the convenient use of this knowledge graph. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) is a digital library for machine-actionable scholarly knowledge, with a focus on structured research comparisons obtained through expert crowdsourcing. While the ORKG has attracted a community of more than 1,000 users, the curated data has not been subject to an in-depth quality assessment so far. Here, proposed as a first exemplary step, within a team of domain experts, we evaluate the quality of six selected ORKG Comparisons based on three criteria, namely: 1) the quality of semantic modelling, 2) the maturity of the Comparisons in terms of their completeness, syntactic representation, identifier stability, and their linkability mechanisms ensuring the interoperability and discoverability. Finally, 3) the informative usefulness of the Comparisons to expert and lay users. We have found that each criterion addresses a unique and independent aspect of quality. Backed by the observations of our quality evaluations presented in this paper, a fitting model of knowledge graph quality appears one that is indeed multidimensional as ours. © 2024, The Author(s).

AB  - This paper presents AIKoGAM, an innovative AI-driven Knowledge Graph of the Antiquities Market, developed to decipher the complexities of the global antiquities trade, a realm where legal and illicit activities often intertwine. AIKoGAM is designed to tackle the dual challenges of artifact authenticity and legality in a market marked by legislative inconsistencies across countries. The system is structured into four primary modules: Information Retrieval, Data Mapping and Transformation, Event Extraction, and Knowledge Graph Construction. These modules work in tandem to collect, standardize, process, and visualize data from diverse sources like auction houses and galleries. The resultant Knowledge Graph Database (KGDB) forms an intricate network of nodes and relationships, shedding light on the connections between objects, dealers, collectors, and auction houses. This analysis offers unprecedented insights into the antiquities market’s dynamics, highlighting the potential pathways of illicit activities and providing valuable information for market regulators and cultural heritage professionals. AIKoGAM shows the power of combining AI and network science in cultural heritage studies, paving the way for more informed policy-making and ethical practices in the antiquities trade. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Yue opera, as one of the representatives of China’s intangible cultural heritage, embodies a profound regional history and folk art. This paper focuses on utilizing knowledge graphs to promote research and preservation efforts in the field of Yue Opera’s lineage. By mining the characteristics of the lineage domain, designing an ontology model, and employing ChatGPT for knowledge extraction, a knowledge graph specific to Yue Opera’s lineage is constructed to facilitate knowledge integration in the domain. Furthermore, this study also develops an application prototype named YueGraph (A video is shown in https://github.com/Ani-li/YueGraph/blob/main/demo.mp4) that explores the knowledge graph of the Yue Opera lineage through question-answering and visualization. YueGraph has been deployed at the Zhejiang Xiaobaihua Yue Opera Theatre to provide strong support for the preservation of the Yue Opera lineage. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

AB  - Image-text retrieval (ITR) is a fundamental and challenging task, aiming to retrieve semantically relevant images (texts) based on text (image) queries. It finds broad applications in search systems, online shopping, and social networks. Its primary challenge is measuring the similarity between the two modalities of vision and language. Most previous works have relied on extracting instance-level feature representations while overlooking the enhancement effect of external commonsense knowledge on these features. In this paper, we propose a method that leverages Knowledge Graphs and the Faiss library to improve the representation of the two modalities and retrieval efficiency (KGFC). First, we construct a Knowledge Graph Enhanced Embedding (KGEE) module. Following existing approaches, we build a knowledge graph to obtain node concept representations, filtered, weighted, and integrated to enrich instance-level features. Additionally, we utilize the Faiss library to create indices for the retrieval database and store them offline, significantly boosting retrieval efficiency. Extensive experiments on the MSCOCO benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of retrieval accuracy. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Web of Things (WoT) brings web technologies and knowledge graphs to Internet of Things. JSON-LD, with its popularity in representing and exchanging structured data on the web, can be a suitable data format for WoT. However, its verbose nature can pose challenges for constrained IoT devices with limited bandwidth, and memory. In this paper, we study CBOR-LD scheme for encoding JSON-LD to a lightweight binary format CBOR (Compact Binary Object Representation). We also study possible optimisations such as using a custom dictionary. We provide a C library and evaluate it on several examples. Results demonstrate that our approach provides savings up to 94% in terms of network overhead for IoT devices.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The unreliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) owing to Machine Hallucination necessitates a shift towards Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), to ensure the veracity of LLM generated content. Inspired by Knowledge Graph based RAG techniques and their advantages of reduced token cost, improved computational performance and knowledge discovery, we present a 'Knowledge Web' Structure and its associated techniques for Information Storage and Retrieval. We also explore the structure's synergy with a Fact Finding LLM Agent, capable of generating answers for multi-hop questions from challenging datasets such as the MuSiQue dataset. While still in the experimental phase, our initial results are promising, indicating the potential efficacy of our approach compared to existing RAG techniques. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Safeguarding Information Technology (IT) heritage is a matter of general interest. This is the aim of the ITinHeritage project, which takes a heritage-based approach to IT museums in France and around the world. The unprecedented study of this heritage leads us to understand how to perpetuate and mediate contemporary scientific and technical knowledge, of which data is the new heritage. They also constitute the new corpora, which means that terminology work needs to be rethought. The ITinHeritage project aims to develop an innovative approach to digital humanities by creating a corpus from the collections of IT museums, organised in the form of a knowledge graph, and by using methods and tools that combine traditional linguistic approaches and explorations in the computer sciences. Big data, AI and NLP are thus being used to explore, enhance and perpetuate their own heritage. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Purpose: Despite ongoing research into archival metadata standards, digital archives are unable to effectively represent records in their appropriate contexts. This study aims to propose a knowledge graph that depicts the diverse relationships between heterogeneous digital archive entities. Design/methodology/approach: This study introduces and describes a method for applying knowledge graphs to digital archives in a step-by-step manner. It examines archival metadata standards, such as Records in Context Ontology (RiC-O), for characterising digital records; explains the process of data refinement, enrichment and reconciliation with examples; and demonstrates the use of knowledge graphs constructed using semantic queries. Findings: This study introduced the 97imf.kr archive as a knowledge graph, enabling meaningful exploration of relationships within the archive’s records. This approach facilitated comprehensive record descriptions about different record entities. Applying archival ontologies with general-purpose vocabularies to digital records was advised to enhance metadata coherence and semantic search. Originality/value: Most digital archives serviced in Korea are limited in the proper use of archival metadata standards. The contribution of this study is to propose a practical application of knowledge graph technology for linking and exploring digital records. This study details the process of collecting raw data on archives, data preprocessing and data enrichment, and demonstrates how to build a knowledge graph connected to external data. In particular, the knowledge graph of RiC-O vocabulary, Wikidata and Schema.org vocabulary and the semantic query using it can be applied to supplement keyword search in conventional digital archives. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - As digital iconography takes hold in contemporary art history studies and gradually encompasses iconology and disciplines in hermeneutics, the question arises whether existing nomenclatures are suitable for representing different levels of interpretation of the image. One such nomenclature is IconClass, a hierarchical and alphanumeric classification system: we try to understand to what extent it can encode emotional variables that may aid iconological interpretation. In this study, we select a corpus of images from the photographic archive of the Bibliotheca Hertziana, categorized by IconClass terms from Classical mythology. We associated terms from the SenticNet vocabulary to each image, using the keywords that IconClass itself assigns to its categories. We then had the same images annotated by independent, non-expert raters, who were given no information on the scenes being depicted. A comparative study of these two ratings yielded that, although there is less disagreement on the sentiments most commonly associated to tragedy, the variety of emotional content in classical imagery remains largely unexpressed by what is arguably the most widely adopted classification system for visual art. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is a set of files and software tools that brings together many health and biomedical vocabularies and standards to enable interoperability between computer systems. Maintained by the National Library of Medicine, UMLS includes over 3 million concepts and 11 million unique terms from over 200 vocabularies, including SNOMED CT, ICD-10, LOINC, MeSH, and RxNorm. The UMLS aims to facilitate the development of computer-based systems that can effectively understand and use biomedical information from various sources. However, several authors have diagnosed significant problems with the predicate relationships in UMLS, including inconsistencies, ambiguities, redundancies and, in the case of transitive relationships, cycles. This last issue, cycles, became our concern when we attempted to search for clinical codes in transitive closures of narrower UMLS concepts in an NQF (National Quality Forum) 1 query for early-onset diabetes quality metrics. To address the challenges within UMLS, the study leverages a neuro-symbolic knowledge graph framework. This innovative approach integrates logic-based semantic reasoning and Large Language Models (LLMs) to clean the UMLS graph and eliminate cycles effectively. By validating existing hierarchical and equivalence relations through this framework, the project successfully prunes a significant number of cycles (66 %) from UMLS. This outcome demonstrates the potential of Neuro-symbolic AI in enhancing the reliability and precision of biomedical information systems. A cleaned up UMLS saves time for data scientists that can have more trust in the outcome of their queries and might even save lives by being more precise in analytics underlying treatments.  © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The current demand for aircraft panel assembly fixtures necessitates agile manufacturing solutions. Traditional welding fixtures struggle to meet diverse panel types, high quantities, and short manufacturing cycles. Conversely, reconfigurable flexible assembly fixtures offer universality, efficiency and ease of maintenance but heavily rely on designers' experience, hindering knowledge reuse. Existing research on computer-aided fixture design (CAFD) primarily addresses specialized fixtures, neglecting reconfigurable flexible ones, lacking fixture design knowledge systems. Aiming at the above problems, the study proposes an intelligent design method for the reconfigurable flexible assembly fixture for aircraft panels based on the smart composite jig model (SCJM) and knowledge graph (KG). Firstly, based on the SCJM of the aircraft panel type assembly fixture (PSCJM), a configuration design method is proposed to carry out the multi-level design of reconfigurable assembly fixture to instantiate PSCJM containing fixture configuration rules and a module library based on model definition (MBD). Then, a knowledge retrieval method is proposed to search the suitable fixture design knowledge based on KG, assisting designers in achieving the flexible design of aircraft panel reconfigurable assembly fixtures. Finally, practical engineering design validation confirms the method's feasibility and effectiveness in obtaining the reconfigurable flexible assembly fixture design scheme for aircraft panels. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Digital humanities introduces knowledge graph, visual analysis and other technologies into humanities research, which provides a new method for the inheritance and dissemination of traditional Chinese culture. This paper visually analyzes the text of Five Thousand Years of Chinese history from three dimensions: keyword word cloud map, character relationship knowledge graph, and Sankey map of historical events. Firstly, the keyword cloud map was realized by Python and multiple third-party libraries, which was convenient for readers to quickly appreciate the key points expressed in the text. Secondly, entity recognition was performed through hanLP, triple relationships were obtained through the deep learning model, and the knowledge graph of character relationships was stored through Neo4j, which was convenient for readers to understand historical characters and clarify the relationship between characters. Finally, Sankey diagrams are generated according to the characters, events and time order through the ECharts visualization chart library, which is convenient for readers to sort out the relationship between characters and events, and clarify the historical order. It provides a new perspective for the visual analysis of single text and temporal text in the field of digital humanities research, and provides a broader foundation for future research. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper we introduce a conversational robot designed to assist children in searching a museum’s cultural heritage video archive. The robot employs a form of Spoken Conversational Search to facilitate the clarification of children’s interest (their information need) in specific videos from the archive. Children are typically insufficiently supported in this process by common search technologies such as search-bar and keyboard, or one-shot voice interfaces. We present our approach, which leverages a knowledge-graph representation of the museum’s video archive to facilitate conversational search interactions and suggest content based on the interaction, in order to study information-seeking conversations with children. We plan to use the robot test-bed to investigate the effectiveness of conversational designs over one-shot voice interactions for clarifying children’s information needs in a museum context. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - With the advancement of smart grid transformation, the configuration audit of distribution network communication networks faces challenges such as diversified network devices, numerous manufacturers, and multi-source data management. Traditional methods exhibit significant deficiencies in processing efficiency and data consistency, failing to meet the demands of large-scale data management. This paper proposes a standard library construction method for configuration audit of distribution network data networks. By integrating knowledge graph technology with convolutional neural networks, this method establishes dynamic and static audit libraries, achieving accurate, rapid, and comprehensive management of audit data. The specific process includes the collection and preprocessing of multi-source data, construction of the knowledge graph, application of the inference mechanism, and intelligent retrieval and updating of the standard library. This method significantly improves the accuracy and completeness of data security configuration and optimizes the configuration audit process of distribution network communication networks. ©2024 IEEE.

AB  - According to the National Library of Medicine, the anatomical disease section includes 18 major categories with more than 26000 known diseases. Although medical domain knowledge is such an important pillar of modern human society, it still consists of a lot of textual medical knowledge. In a few recent years, knowledge graphs emerged as a solution to represent textual data in the form of graphs. In our work, we aim to develop a knowledge graph dedicated toward the medical domain, which will organize textual knowledge into a format that can be easily queried to produce knowledge both faster and in an efficient manner. The source data-set is chosen from Pub-Med, a subsidiary of National Centre of Biotechnology Information, alongside using Mondo ontology for rich structure of knowledge graph. Our framework consists of data preprocessing, entity extraction, relation extraction, triple construction and constructing a data set of RDF triplet. We then used RDF triplet to represent nodes and edges, which we subsequently deployed to Neo4J. ©2024 IEEE.

AB  - Industry 5.0 emphasises human-centric intelligent manufacturing, posing challenges in integrating human expertise with advanced machine capabilities. To address these challenges, a novel three-layer cognitive digital twin model based on knowledge graphs is proposed, designed to integrate workers’ knowledge and experience into intelligent manufacturing processes. This model comprises three layers: an ontology layer that constructs a foundational process knowledge ontology library; a knowledge layer that maps real-time data to dynamically update digital models; and a cognitive layer that utilises machine learning, knowledge reasoning, and knowledge mining for advanced analysis, state understanding, and model evolution. The model promotes user interaction through intuitive interfaces and a Q&A system, leveraging techniques such as knowledge reasoning and querying to support decision-making and enhance worker engagement. Validated through a system implemented for aero-engine blade production, this cognitive digital twin model leverages human expertise and machine capabilities to enhance process control, quality management, and overall efficiency. The proposed approach demonstrates significant potential for advancing personalised human-machine interaction in manufacturing, truly embodying the value of a human-centric approach and paving the way for future developments in the field. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Consumption of several dynamic media diets in the past few years for gaining information about cryptocurrency has seen a huge growth in the past few years. There is a continuously growing relationship between dynamic media and cryptocurrency markets, where just a small tweet by a crypto-tastemaker, a celebrity, or just a plain influencer could determine the fate of any crypto market. This has been extended to markets of several other domains gradually. Dynamic media now seem to shape the views, opinions, ideas, and sentiments of its consumers. This paper aims to determine the very same sentiment of such consumers with respect to these digital currencies and to convey such sentiment in a graphical manner. Ontological Relational Graphs or otherwise known as Knowledge Graphs, are a group of visual tools presented in UML - style diagram where several entities/ideas/concepts in the form of nodes are linked to each other through means of ontological libraries - that are often in guise as the edges of a Knowledge Graph.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Entity alignment (EA) aims to link entities referring to the same real-world identity from different knowledge graphs (KGs). Most existing EA methods focus on static KGs, while practical graphs are growing and changing over time. Although some EA methods study dynamic settings to suit the changes, they perform suboptimal as they are unaware of knowledge oblivion and the prohibitive model size. To address the above issues, we propose a Parameter-Lite dynamic Entity Alignment model (PLEA), which leverages prior knowledge to embed entities and even represent unseen entities. We design a novel lightweight module that only trains a small number of parameters added by the adapter and keeps the original network fixed, so as to retain knowledge from previous snapshots with low computational cost. As for unseen entities, we design a regularized entity mapping mechanism to inject prior knowledge into unseen entity embeddings to improve representation ability. The experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed PLEA archives up to 4% accuracy with only 50% of the number of parameters, compared with existing state-of-art methods. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have emerged as a valuable tool for supporting humanities scholars and cultural heritage organisations. In this resource paper, we present the Musical Meetups Knowledge Graph (MMKG), a collection of evidence of historical collaborations between personalities relevant to the music history domain. We illustrate how we built the KG with a hybrid methodology that, combining knowledge engineering with natural language processing, including the use of Large Language Models (LLM), machine learning, and other techniques, identifies the constituent elements of a historical meetup. MMKG is a network of historical meetups extracted from ∼33k biographies collected from Wikipedia focused on European musical culture between 1800 and 1945. We discuss how, by providing a structured representation of social interactions, MMKG supports digital humanities applications and music historians’ research, teaching, and learning. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - The research delves into the process of extracting relationships from biomedical literature and building a knowledge graph using those relationships. Information retrieval, knowledge discovery, and data analysis are just a few of the uses for named entity extraction in biomedical research, which includes important entities such as Adverse Drug Effects (ADE), doses, drug names, and more. Using BERT's word contextual comprehension, the report investigates the use of the BioBERT model for named entity recognition and relationship extraction. When calibrated on Electronic Health Records (EHR) data, BioBERT - a biological text-specific model - helps with clinical decision-making and research by recognizing links between elements such as diseases, symptoms, and therapies. The use of Neo4j for knowledge graph generation, which permits a thorough representation of biomedical concepts and their relationships, is also highlighted in the paper. Information retrieval and analysis are made easier by this organized knowledge. This strategy has the potential to revolutionize biomedical research and healthcare by providing fresh perspectives and better results, despite ongoing challenges. More developments in this field are anticipated as a result of ongoing research and development. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Exploration, analysis, and preservation of the rich cultural and historical tapestry of the world are essential for our understanding of humanity’s past and shaping our future. In recent years, there has been increased interest in the creation and application of Ontologies, Knowledge Graphs, and other Semantic Web Technologies within cultural heritage (CH) and digital humanities (DH). However, to date, the distinct areas of expertise, methodologies and traditions across the fields have led to a noticeable gap between tech solutions and humanities’ needs. The aim of the International Workshop of Semantic Digital Humanities (SemDH) was to bridge this division and encourage closer collaboration and networking across diverse fields. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The escalating complexity and dynamism of the cybersecurity landscape necessitates a robust, adaptive framework for the integration, analysis, and dissemination of cybersecurity knowledge. This paper introduces the Cybersecurity Ontology Network (CON), a foundational step towards establishing a comprehensive Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph (CKG). The CON framework is designed to semantically organize and interconnect diverse cybersecurity information, focusing on software components, thus including vulnerabilities, libraries, and projects. By leveraging ontological structures, CON enables a more nuanced, context-aware synthesis of cybersecurity data from disparate sources, facilitating advanced analytical capabilities. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The paper tackles the challenges of modeling the temporal validity of artist-recorded locations documented in exhibition catalogs by proposing three different ontological patterns for recording spatiotemporal-constrained assertions in a Knowledge Graph. Exhibition catalogs often document the address used by an artist participating in exhibitions. The analysis of this information offers significant insights into the spatial and social dimensions of artistic communities. However, the time-bound nature of the information makes its modeling particularly challenging, as it requires a framework that can effectively represent both the spatial and temporal dimensions of the relation. The connection between artist and their address, in fact, is always a fluent, a relationships that only hold within specific time intervals. To overcome this challenge, the study proposes and compares three ontological patterns designed for formalizing the dynamic aspects of spatial, temporal, and conceptual characteristics of an entity. The three approaches, based on RDF-star, CIDOC-CRM, and 4D ontology, are evaluated based on their ability to accurately represent the diachronic nature of addresses, formalizing (whether implicitly or explicitly) the validity of spatiotemporal assertions, and facilitating data integration and analysis. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Purpose: Currently, the Tang tomb mural cultural relic resources are presented in a multi-source and heterogeneous manner, with a lack of effective organization and sharing between resources. Therefore, this study aims to propose a multidimensional knowledge discovery solution for Tang tomb mural cultural relic resources. Design/methodology/approach: Taking the Tang tomb murals collected by the Shaanxi History Museum as an example, based on clarifying the relevant concepts of Tang tomb mural resources and considering both dynamic and static dimensions, a top-down approach was adopted to first construct an ontology model of Tang tomb mural type cultural relics resources. Then, the actual case data was imported into the Neo4J graph database according to the defined pattern hierarchy to complete the static organization of knowledge, and presented in a multimodal form in knowledge reasoning and retrieval. In addition, geographic information system (GIS) technology is used to dynamically display the spatiotemporal distribution of Tang tomb mural resources, and the distribution trend is analysed from a digital humanistic perspective. Findings: The multi-dimensional knowledge discovery of Tang tomb mural cultural relics resources can help establish the correlation and spatiotemporal relationship between resources, providing support for semantic retrieval and navigation, knowledge discovery and visualization and so on. Originality/value: This study takes the murals in the collection of the Shaanxi History Museum as an example, revealing potential knowledge associations in a static and intelligent way, achieving knowledge discovery and management of Tang tomb murals, and dynamically presents the spatial distribution of Tang tomb murals through GIS technology, meeting the knowledge presentation needs of different users and opening up new ideas for the study of Tang tomb murals. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The paper discusses an approach to constructing a personal knowledge graph based on an ontological description of a scientific subject area and its data, presented in the form of a knowledge graph. The presentation is based on concepts related to information and data mining, such as subject domain ontology, scientific subject area, thesaurus, semantic digital library, personal knowledge graph. The procedure for constructing a personal knowledge graph is presented using the example of the mathematics subject area, the ontology of which is based on extensive material from the mathematical encyclopedia edited by academician I.M. Vinogradov within the framework of the semantic library LibMeta. The proposed approach will make it possible to use the content of the Mathematics semantic library for scientific research, minimizing the process of searching for information in the local subject area, without losing more general results contained outside this area. This work refers to the experience of building semantic libraries based on thesauruses and ontological design. Construction of ontologies based on the thesaurus of the subject area is a necessary condition for constructing a personal knowledge graph of the scientific subject area. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - The phenomenon of aimless web navigation, often compared to falling”down the rabbit hole,” brings to light significant aspects of the Internet’s”long tail” concept. This research examines whether longer, non-goal-oriented web sessions genuinely lead users into the long tail of digital libraries, thereby exploring the discoverability of cultural heritage. The focus of this study is on Gallica, the French national library’s online platform. This work aims to identify and characterize such sessions within Gallica, defining rabbit holes as long and diversified navigation sessions. The difÏculty lies in identifying rabbit holes within server logs, which requires a mixed-methods approach involving interviews, qualitative studies, and simple statistical analyses. Despite Gallica’s lack of hypertextual structure, we show that users do engage in rabbit hole-like behavior, navigating through keyword searches and filters. The study’s findings align with user testimonies. A crucial conclusion is that rabbit holes in Gallica do not generally lead users to less-consulted content. This limitation is attributed to the search engine, which users must somewhat”hack” to navigate effectively. Enhancing Gallica’s discoverability tools without compromising the existing user experience is essential for improving content accessibility. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Archival information cannot be efficiently utilized by traditional archival retrieval methods and is difficult to be used for archival retrieval. In order to improve the intelligence of archive retrieval, an archive semantic retrieval method based on knowledge graph is proposed. First, according to the semantic retrieval query behavior of the current user, its semantic query behavior preference is recorded to establish the user's personalized query preference. Then, using the already constructed personalized knowledge graph, the semantic retrieval keywords are analyzed for personalized semantic query preference, and then the user's query intent is understood. Finally, a personalized keyword ranking analysis retrieval algorithm is proposed. The experimental results show that the personalized semantic search engine greatly improves the accuracy of retrieval. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Science enables progress. Software engineering research and its sub-research fields like software architecture have high economic relevance (cf. "software is eating the world") and serve as an enabler for technical innovations in other research fields as well. The ever-increasing amount of research results and insights creates the need for efficient knowledge documentation and search functions to access relevant information. Till now, scientific papers have been published digitally as PDF documents. Researchers and practitioners can access these documents via digital libraries and scientific search engines mostly with a simple keyword-based search. Literature studies in software engineering show that this procedure (a) requires enhanced information literacy skills even for domain experts and (b) is very time-consuming for aggregating evidence in written PDF articles to a specific field of interest. Consequently, we can derive a need for speeding up the information-finding process and effective knowledge representation as well as aggregation for evidence-based literature studies. As a result, we present our approach idea for effective knowledge access and discovery in software architecture research by combining knowledge graphs and large language models, using the complementary advantages of both concepts. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - As libraries manage increasingly vast collections, the task of identifying suitable books for readers has become increasingly time-consuming and complex. Traditional recommendation systems face challenges in effectively handling networks charac-terized by intricate interactions and diverse entity relationships, often struggling with scalability. To address these limitations, this study explores the use of Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCN) to improve book recommendation systems. A knowledge graph is constructed to capture the complex relation-ships between entities such as readers, books, and their various attributes. Through the RGCN architecture, the model learns relation-specific embeddings, enabling accurate link prediction for book recommendations. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach not only surpasses traditional recommendation systems in terms of accuracy and scalability but also offers valuable insights into reader preferences and book relevance, thereby enhancing the recommendation process in large-scale library systems. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The Virtual Record Treasury of Ireland (VRTI), a virtual archive currently in the third phase of its research programme (2023-2025), places a key emphasis on utilising Semantic Web technologies to further construct a comprehensive knowledge graph (KG) of historical Irish biographical data. To do this, computer scientists and historians are collaborating closely to enhance the VRTI Knowledge Graph for Irish History (VRTI-KG) in a multidisciplinary manner. Biographical data was uplifted to RDF format as a result of the collaboration, and the prosopographical graph currently includes 965 women and 8807 notable men from Irish history. Apart from employing the out-of-the-box tools, a new tailored VRTI-KG Editor has been introduced to facilitate the exploration of the VRTI-KG. This paper describes the VRTI-KG’s technical architecture and provides an overview of the tools being used to interact with and explore VRTI-KG, as illustrated by a use case using a notable people whose graph is displayed. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - RDF2Vec has emerged as a popular method for unsupervised feature extraction from RDF graphs. However, RDF2Vec cannot handle large graphs efficiently, due to (i) the size of RDF graphs or intermediate results being prohibitively large, and (ii) the high computational complexity associated with graph walks of increasing breadth and depth, which makes their processing difficult, if not impossible, on a single machine. We address this limitation by introducing SERE, a scalable and distributed framework for unsupervised embeddings computation on large-scale Knowledge Graphs. SERE is open-source, well-documented, and fully integrated into the SparkKG-ML Python library. Our experiments demonstrate that SEREis able to compute embeddings over Knowledge Graphs with millions of edges within hours, and is up to 7 times faster than RDF2Vec even for small Knowledge Graphs, all while achieving comparable accuracy to RDF2Vec in a benchmark classification task. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The advent of generative artificial intelligence, and in particular large language models, has opened up new possibilities for information processing in a multitude of domains. Nevertheless, it is essential to validate their output in order to ensure its validity within the specified context. This is due to their nature as probabilistic models of language, which may lead to the generation of inaccuracies or nonexistent facts commonly known as hallucinations. As a solution, we propose a framework and a prompt structure for the validation of the results of generative artificial intelligence in formats that are more human-comprehensible through the use of conceptual models. We denote this as conceptual model augmented generative artificial intelligence (CMAG). We illustrate the approach through application examples in the domains of data management, knowledge graphs and cultural heritage, and software engineering. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - To enhance the user experience and resource discoverability of Infopedia, the Singapore encyclopedia, the National Library Board of Singapore (NLB) uses Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) for Named Entity Recognition (NER), aiming to automate metadata enrichment of its digital encyclopedia articles. This initiative leverages GPT-4's capabilities in accurately identifying and incorporating relevant Singaporean entities before integrating them into the NLB's Knowledge Graph, improving recommendations of related resources. An evaluation on a subset of 100 articles demonstrates a precision score of 0.975, indicating high entity detection with minimal inaccuracies. The team acknowledges challenges related to GPT-4's black-box nature and the potential for non-reproducibility. This effort illustrates the potential of generative AI to streamline metadata enrichment processes, offering a promising avenue for enhancing metadata of digital libraries.  © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - With the increase in the prevalence of Security Information and Event Management Systems (SIEMs) in today's organizations, there is a growing interest in data-driven threat detection. In this research, we formulate malware detection as a large-scale graph mining and inference problem using host-level system events/logs. Our approach is built on two basic principles: guilt-by-association and exempt-by-reputation, with the intuition, that an adversary's resources are limited; hence, reusing infrastructures and techniques is inevitable. We present MalLink, a system that models all host-level process activities as a Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN). The HIN emphasizes shared characteristics of processes/files across the enterprise, e.g., parent/sub-processes, written/read files, loaded libraries, registry entries, and network connections. MalLink then propagates maliciousness from a set of previously known malicious entities to obtain a set of previously unknowns. MalLink was deployed in a real-world setting, next to the SIEM system of a large international enterprise, and evaluated using 8 days (20 TB) of EDR logs collected from all endpoints within the organization. The results demonstrate high detection performance (F1-score of 0.83), particularly when manually investigating the 50 highest scored files with no prior, 37 are found malicious. This demonstrates MalLink's capability to detect previously unknown malicious files. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Embodied interaction is a significant direction within the realm of interaction design. Interaction design does not only enhance efficiency in people's lives; it focuses on how humans and computer systems interact efficiently and effectively. In embodied interaction, natural interactive behaviors can be employed to enhance experiences. Interaction is now omnipresent; it serves as an intermediary to establish connections and provide reflection, and not just consolidated within products like smartphones and computers. The incorporation of interaction design into physical life, intertwining with human behaviors and spatial environments, poses our contemplation. Thus, under the backdrop of sustainable development goals (SDGs), we adopted the direction of embodied interaction and utilized metaphors to create a tangible installation. We aspire for urban explorers to establish connections with the city in terms of time and space dimensions through interactive experiences, thereby comprehending the multifaceted nature of the city. Throughout the design process, we validated and iterated our designs via prototyping and user testing.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.

AB  - This paper describes the Integration of Archives and Cultural Places (IaCuP) project, which aims to integrate information about a historical cemetery, including its map and grave inventory, with genealogical and documentary knowledge extracted from relevant historical archives. The integrated data are accessible to cemetery visitors through an interactive mobile application, enabling them to navigate a graphical representation of the cemetery while exploring comprehensive visualizations of genealogical data. The basic idea stems from the desire to provide people with access to the rich context of cultural sites, which have often lost their original references over the centuries, making it challenging for individuals today to interpret the meanings embedded within them. The proposed approach leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract information from relevant documents and Web technologies to represent such information as interactive visualizations. As a practical case study, this paper focuses on the Jewish Cemetery in Pisa and the Historical Archives of the Jewish Community in Pisa, working on the genealogical tree of one of the most representative families resting in the cemetery. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Large language models are rapidly advancing the field of artificial intelligence, with current research focusing primarily on traditional natural language understanding tasks, such as question answering and information extraction. However, in knowledge-intensive domains, such as intangible cultural heritage, hallucination problems due to insufficient domain knowledge persist. To address this, we present ChatTf, a knowledge graph-enhanced intelligent Q&A system, exemplified by Chinese traditional folklore, aimed at reducing factuality hallucinations in this domain. Specifically, we constructed the Traditional Folklore Ontology (TFOnto) and proposed the Zero-shot Traditional Folklore Triplet Extraction (ZFTE) framework. Driven by TFOnto, ZFTE builds a Traditional Folklore Knowledge Graph (TFKG). We then proposed a dual-stage Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework (TFKG-RAG) based on TFKG to provide traditional folklore knowledge to large language models, mitigating factuality hallucinations in folklore Q&A tasks. In the experimental phase, ChatTf achieved an accuracy of 96.7% on a self-built TFCQD test set, outperforming several state-of-the-art baseline methods. This demonstrates the accuracy and reliability of folklore domain question answering.  © 2024 The Authors.

Conventional SPARQL querying systems require the users to be familiar with the data schema and SPARQL syntax. However, this is often very difficult for many users in industrial production, who have mostly an engineering background, instead of a semantic web. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) make it possible for non-semantic experts to use natural language to query knowledge graphs (KG). In this work, we present a framework and preliminary results of integrating Industry 4.0 KGs with LLMs to improve how data is represented, reasoned, and processed in manufacturing contexts, facilitating user interaction with KGs and contributing to operational efficiency. Our technique enhances Language Models (LLMs) by utilising the semantic complexity and interdependence of Knowledge Graphs (KGs). This allows us to incorporate domain-specific knowledge. We used the FAISS library and LLaMA2 to optimise the storage and retrieval of vectors, which improved the system’s performance and scalability. This integration allows for advanced fault detection, proactive maintenance, and process optimisation, resulting in decreased periods of inactivity and improved productivity. We introduce the framework’s architecture, implementation strategy, and possible advantages while also discussing the difficulties associated with data integration and scalability. The results of our study show that the integration of KG-LLM surpasses traditional approaches in terms of operational efficiency, as evidenced by enhanced fault detection, proactive maintenance, and process optimisation, thereby opening up possibilities for the advancement of more intelligent and resilient production systems. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Converting mineral deposit data with diverse heterogeneity and complex semantics into structured data is a vital challenge faced by the mineral resources exploration big data field today. Traditional machine learning methods have been proven insufficient in accurately describing the semantic information on entity concepts, properties, and their property values, resulting in the poor interpretability of heterogeneous and diverse data. As a result, the development of explainable knowledge graphs has become a current research hotspot. Despite this, the research on ontology construction in the ore deposit field remains relatively scarce, impeding the study progress of ore deposit knowledge graph. This article emphasizes the description of concepts, relationships, and properties of ore deposits. With the combination of knowledge engineering, lexicons, reused precedents, and expert knowledge, by applying the ontology construction method based on knowledge engineering and top-level ontology and using the ontology development tool Protégé, we have built the ontology database of ore deposit domain based on spatiotemporal mineral deposit text. This approach results in systematic, standardized, and formalized expressions for concepts and relationships of mineral deposit knowledges. Subsequently, we used the Neo4j program to establish a knowledge graph of the ontology library and utilized the Pangxidong polymetallic mineral deposit as a case study to connect the ore deposit ontology with mineral deposit data, demonstrating the important significance of the ore deposit ontology as the framework of knowledge graph. The research in this paper provides a certain guiding significance for the subsequent reasoning analysis of ore deposit knowledge graph. © 2024 China Association for Science and Technology.

AB  - The longstanding illicit trafficking of archaeological artefacts has persistently presented a global issue, posing a substantial threat to cultural heritage. This paper introduces an innovative automated system that utilises Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Social Network Analysis (SNA) to construct a Knowledge Graph for antiquities. The objective is to offer insights into the provenance of artefacts and identify potential instances of illicit trafficking. The paper delineates a comprehensive methodology, from the ontology to the Knowledge Graph. The methodology comprises four distinct phases: the initial phase involves tailoring existing ontologies to match project-specific needs; the second phase centres on selecting appropriate technologies, and scraping and text-mining tools are designed to extract pertinent data from textual sources; the third phase centres in the creation of a robust and accurate Knowledge Graph that captures artefact provenance. The paper suggests employing NLP models, specifically utilising Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques. These models automatically extract relevant information from the unstructured provenance texts, organising them as events to which both objects and actors participated with their locations and dates. The final phase is concerned with defining and building the Knowledge Graph. The authors explore a property graph model that distinctively represents nodes and relationships, each augmented by associated properties. Employing an SNA approach, the model is projected in multiple network levels of ownership histories (actor-object network) or actor relationships (actor-actor network). This approach reveals patterns within the antiquities market. When integrated with the authors' recommended strategies such as crowdsourced ontology definition, collaboration with reputable organisations for quality sources, and the application of transfer learning techniques, the suggested approach holds promising implications for the protection of cultural heritage.  © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Historical tourism documentation includes guidebooks, pamphlets, and digital resources, which are collections of materials that promote the exploration of historical sites, events, and cultural heritage. These materials aim to offer insights into the history and importance of particular locations, people, and items. Within these documents, nominal historical terminologies possess valuable information, serving as significant entities that can contribute to our understanding of history. This study introduces a method for knowledge graph (KG) generation through Thai co-occurrence network analysis, called ThaiCoGen. This work improves KG generation by using three important methods: (1) term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) to find important terms and entities; (2) Thai co-occurrence network text analysis (ThaiCoNet) to connect semantic relationships; and (3) adding to KGs using linked open data from encyclopedias. Our contributions are the generation of KGs using extracted high-n-gram entities and the highlighting of semantic enrichment. Our contributions include (1) generating KGs by identifying the extracted height n-gram entities and (2) highlighting semantic enrichment. A case study was conducted on the Thai encyclopedia LST.org in the domain of the Suvarnabhumi Silk Road and demonstrated the efficacy of the ThaiCoGen methodology. Despite the substantial temporal gap between historical records from the Suvarnabhumi Silk Road era (100-700 BE) and contemporary tourist documentation from the modern era (2500 BE), ThaiCoGen successfully integrates these sources into enriched KGs. The discussion of this paper intends to elaborate on the historically accurate portrayal of the Suvarnabhumi Silk Road from the enriched KG, especially Thailand's tourism industry. Finally, this research provides the open KGs for Thailand's cultural heritage in order to build the robustness of semantic application development.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - As the number and complexity of live-line operations increase, so does the associated risk, making risk analysis and prevention of live-line operations an important aspect of safety research. This study focuses on typical live-line operation scenarios, such as climbing distribution line poles. Based on the professional knowledge involved in live-line operations, it analyzes the necessary key operational actions and related transition actions, establishes standardized actions and norms for live-line workers, and constructs a standardized action sample library for live-line operation scenarios. By employing knowledge graph and action recognition technology, the study proposes a comprehensive live-line operation safety management solution. This solution not only enhances the safety awareness and professional skills of the operators but also significantly reduces the accident rate and improves work efficiency.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Image-based retrieval in large Earth observation archives is challenging because one needs to navigate across thousands of candidate matches only with the query image as a guide. By using text as information supporting the visual query, the retrieval system gains in usability, but at the same time faces difficulties due to the diversity of visual signals that cannot be summarized by a short caption only. For this reason, as a matching-based task, cross-modal text-image retrieval often suffers from information asymmetry between text and images. To address this challenge, we propose a Knowledge-aware Text-Image Retrieval (KTIR) method for remote sensing images. By mining relevant information from an external knowledge graph, KTIR enriches the text scope available in the search query and alleviates the information gaps between text and images for better matching. Moreover, by integrating domain-specific knowledge, KTIR also enhances the adaptation of pretrained vision-language models to remote sensing applications. Experimental results on three commonly used remote sensing text-image retrieval benchmarks show that the proposed knowledge-aware method leads to varied and consistent retrievals, outperforming state-of-the-art retrieval methods. © 1980-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Digital Libraries containing metadata of diverse cultural heritage objects are meant to be accessible not only to domain experts but also to the general population. This calls for information services that can provide ease and efficiency to search, retrieval and exploration. Knowledge graphs (KGs) are essential for representation, organization, integration, and analysis of hierarchical and heterogeneous information. However, most KGs suffer from incompleteness and inaccuracies. This work intends to address various challenges arising from construction and refinement of a KG populated with historical objects, by defining domain- and application-appropriate ontologies and leveraging approaches in information extraction (IE) for improving metadata quality. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - With the burgeoning use of digital technologies in safeguarding intangible and living heritage, memory institutions have produced a significant body of material yet to be made accessible for public transmission. The quest for new ways to unlock these massive collections has intensified, especially in the case of embodied knowledge embedded in complex formats, such as audiovisual and motion capture data. This study examines a computational workflow that combines posture recognition and movement computing to bridge the gap in accessing digital archives that capture living knowledge and embodied experiences. By reflecting on how embodied knowledge is sustained and potentially valorised through human interaction, we devise a series of methods utilising vision-based feature extraction, pose estimation, movement analysis, and machine learning. The goal is to augment the archival experience with new modes of exploration, representation, and embodiment. This article reports the computational procedures and algorithmic tools inspected through two use cases. In the first example, we visualise the archives of the Prix de Lausanne, a collection of 50 years of video recordings of dance performances, for archival exploration through the dancers' poses. In another experiment, movement encoding is employed to allow multimodal data search via embodied cues in the Hong Kong Martial Arts Living Archive, a comprehensive documentation of the living heritage of martial arts that is chiefly comprised of motion-captured performances by masters. Though holding different application purposes, both projects operate on the proposed framework and extract archive-specific features to create a meaningful representation of human bodies, which reveals the versatile applications that computational capacities can achieve for embodied knowledge archives. The practices also represent a model of interdisciplinary involvement where the archivists, computists, artists, and knowledge holders join hands to renew strategies for archival exploration and heritage interpretation in a new light. © 2024, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

AB  - Story components, namely, events, time, participants, and their relations are present in narrative texts from different domains such as journalism, medicine, finance, and law. The automatic extraction of narrative elements encompasses several NLP tasks such as Named Entity Recognition, Semantic Role Labeling, Event Extraction, and Temporal Inference. The text2story Python, an easy-to-use modular library, supports the narrative extraction and visualization pipeline. The package contains an array of narrative extraction tools that can be used separately or in sequence. With this toolkit, end users can process free text in English or Portuguese and obtain formal representations, like standard annotation files or a formal logical representation. The toolkit also enables narrative visualization as Message Sequence Charts (MSC), Knowledge Graphs, and Bubble Diagrams, making it useful to visualize and transform human-annotated narratives. The package combines the use of off-the-shelf and custom tools and is easily patched (replacing existing components) and extended (e.g. with new visualizations). It includes an experimental module for narrative element effectiveness assessment and being is therefore also a valuable asset for researchers developing solutions for narrative extraction. To evaluate the baseline components, we present some results of the main annotators embedded in our package for datasets in English and Portuguese. We also compare the results with the extraction of narrative elements by GPT-3, a robust LLM model. © 2024 ELRA Language Resource Association: CC BY-NC 4.0.

AB  - The paper introduces the Cultural Leaf Semantic Portal whose aim is to provide a consolidated user-friendly solution for exploring the 36,132 Romanian artifacts and the 1,086 cultural entities that house them. Using the eCHO framework, the data collected from official sources are subjected to a transformation process through which they are sanitized, temporal expressions are normalized, thus reducing the number of forms in which the centuries and millennia are expressed from 1,733 to only 67, and then they are transformed into semantic structures. Finally, the resulting data is accessible via both a SPARQL endpoint and a semantic portal. © 2024, Politechnica University of Bucharest. All rights reserved.

AB  - The steep increase in the number of scholarly publications has given rise to various digital repositories, libraries and knowledge graphs aimed to capture, manage, and preserve scientific data. Efficiently navigating such databases requires a system able to classify scholarly documents according to the respective research (sub-)field. However, not every digital repository possesses a relevant classification schema for categorising publications. For instance, one of the largest digital archives in Computational Linguistics (CL) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), the ACL Anthology, lacks a system for classifying papers into topics and sub-topics. This paper addresses this gap by constructing a corpus of 1,500 ACL Anthology publications annotated with their main contributions using a novel hierarchical taxonomy of core CL/NLP topics and sub-topics. The corpus is used in a shared task with the goal of classifying CL/NLP papers into their respective sub-topics. © 2024 ELRA Language Resource Association: CC BY-NC 4.0.

AB  - This study aims to explore how to achieve innovative design for intangible cultural heritage (ICH) tourism products through User-Centered Design (UCD) theory and the cultural gene approach. Using the national ICH of Mianzhu New Year Pictures as a case study, the research, guided by UCD theory, conducts an in-depth analysis of user needs, with a detailed investigation into users' aesthetic preferences and functional requirements to ensure that the design meets modern market demands. Additionally, the cultural gene approach provides theoretical support for extracting and transforming the core cultural symbols of Mianzhu New Year Pictures, allowing these symbols to be effectively integrated into contemporary products through symbolic design. This approach ensures that the design retains the cultural characteristics of Mianzhu New Year Pictures while enhancing users' cultural identity and overall experience. This study employs a mixed research methodology, with a primary focus on design experimentation, supported by KANO-AHP, ethnographic fieldwork, and iterative testing to analyze user needs and optimize the product. Initially, KANO-AHP is used to conduct a quantitative analysis of user requirements, identifying priorities in functionality, aesthetics, and emotional appeal to provide precise guidelines for product design. Next, ethnographic fieldwork is conducted through observation and interviews to gain deep insights into the cultural background, artistic features, and user contexts of intangible cultural heritage, enabling the extraction of representative cultural gene elements. Finally, the study employs design experimentation for multiple rounds of user testing and product iteration, incorporating feedback from focus groups to progressively enhance the product’s functionality and aesthetic appeal, thereby increasing practicality and user satisfaction. This comprehensive experimental approach allows the researcher to dynamically adjust the product based on real-time feedback, ensuring continuous improvement in actual applications while effectively integrating cultural heritage with modern user needs. The results of the study show that the combination of UCD and cultural genetics methodology can effectively enhance the market attractiveness and cultural heritage value of NRM products. This study not only promotes the application of UCD and cultural gene method in the design of non-heritage products and provides practical guidance for the modernisation and innovation of non-heritage products, but also opens up a new way of thinking for the inheritance and development of non-heritage culture in modern society. © 2024 by the authors; licensee Learning Gate.

AB  - The Sound Wave Scribe Voice Assistant paper is, about how people interact with computers. It uses the advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to incorporate voice commands. Inorder to rely on the intelligence when a user talks to the system, the assistant picks up the sound through a microphone or other input tools. The raw sound goes through steps like reducing noise breaking it into segments and extracting features. Then the system changes the sound into text using speech recognition (ASR). Different NLP components like tokenization part of speech tagging and named entity recognition break down the text into parts. After that the system figures out what users want by analyzing the text. Natural language understanding (NLU) figures out what users are saying while context management ensures transitions in conversations. Depending on what users want the system creates responses that sound human like using natural language generation (NLG) techniques. Dialog management keeps track of context and knowledge graphs offer data for answers. Finally computer generated speech-made using text to speech (TTS) libraries-turns the responses back, into sounding spoken words. The systems flexibility goes beyond setting reminders and scraping the web. You can do it all with voice commands. With connections, to databases and online platforms the Sound Wave Scribe Voice Assistant steps up user ease becoming a resource, for voice activated tech. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Over the past few years, the deployment of Linked Open Data (LOD) technologies has witnessed significant advancements across a myriad of sectors, linguistics included. This progression is characterized by an exponential increase in the conversion of resources to adhere to contemporary encoding standards. Such transformations are driven by the objectives outlined in "ecological" methodologies, notably the FAIR data principles, which advocate for the reuse and interoperability of resources. This paper introduces the solutions devised within a nationwide collaborative research project aimed at integrating techniques and methodologies from the conventional study of epigraphic materials, computational lexicography, semantic web, and other digital humanities subfields. It details its services, utilities, and data types and shows how it manages to produce, exploit, and interlink LLOD and non-LLOD datasets in ways that are meaningful to its intended target disciplinary context, i.e. historical linguistics over epigraphic data. The paper also introduces how DigItAnt services and functionalities will contribute to the empowerment of a recently started Italian infrastructure cluster project devoted to the construction of a nationwide federation of research infrastructures for the humanities and cultural heritage, and in particular to its pilot project towards establishing an authoritative LLOD platform. © 2024 ELRA Language Resource Association.

AB  - Architecture, classification, and major applications of Generative AI interfaces, specifically chatbots, are presented in this paper. Research paper details how the Generative AI interfaces work with various Generative AI approaches and show the architecture and their working. On the other hand, the generative model is built using advanced machine learning techniques to build dynamic, contextually relevant responses automatically. On the other hand, the retrieval-based model builds up with dependency on a predefined response library. The paper also discusses the use of Generative AI to populate Multimedia Knowledge Graphs (KGs), presenting technologies based on the semantic analysis of deep learning and NoSQL to more effectively integrate and retrieve data. The social and ethical challenges that come with the deployment of generative models are critically reviewed. These dialogues bring forward the balance that has to be maintained between progress and necessity in technological advancements, for which the call for ethical responsibility in developing AI is made. The paper presents a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art Generative AI with special focus on the promises and pitfalls in Generative AI research related to both natural language processing and knowledge management. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The core programming language of the Semantic Web is SPARQL. To increase the productivity of Semantic Web programming, reusability of the SPARQL queries is key. Here, we aim to implement a formatter that fully supports SPARQL 1.1 to enhance the reusability of SPARQL. First, SPARQL 1.1 grammar defined in EBNF was transformed into Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG) to generate a SPARQL 1.1 parser. The parser accepts a valid SPARQL query and constructs the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the input SPARQL query. Next, a formatter was implemented to output a SPARQL query from this AST. The SPARQL formatter is available on the command line and also available as a JavaScript library for developing websites. SPARQL ASTs are represented internally in JSON, and can be reused for purposes other than formatting. Furthermore, the PEG expression developed here can be readily modified for similar subgraph matching problems on knowledge graphs. The source code and a website of the SPARQL formatter are available at https://github.com/sparqling/sparql-formatter. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Explanatory processes are at the core of scientific investigation, legal reasoning, and education. However, effectively explaining complex or large amounts of information, such as that contained in a textbook or library, in an intuitive, user-centered way is still an open challenge. Indeed, different people may search for and request different types of information, even though texts typically have a predefined exposition and content. With this paper, we investigate how explanatory AI can better exploit the full potential of the vast and rich content library at our disposal. Based on a recent theory of explanations from Ordinary Language Philosophy, which frames the explanation process as illocutionary question-answering, we have developed a new type of interactive and adaptive textbook. Using the latest question-answering technology, our e-book software (YAI4Edu, for short) generates on-demand, expandable explanations that can help readers effectively explore teaching materials in a pedagogically productive way. It does this by extracting a specialized knowledge graph from a collection of books or other resources that helps identify the most relevant questions to be answered for a satisfactory explanation. We tested our technology with excerpts from a textbook that teaches how to write legal memoranda in the U.S. legal system. Then, to see whether YAI4Edu-enhanced textbooks are better than random and existing, general-purpose explanatory tools, we conducted a within-subjects user study with more than 100 English-speaking students. The students rated YAI4Edu’s explanations the highest. According to the students, the explanatory content generated by YAI4Edu is, on average, statistically better than two baseline alternatives (P values below.005). © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Nanjing Yunjin, a highly representative Chinese silk weaving handicraft, was included in the Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2009. However, due to modern silk weaving technology advancements, aesthetic style evolution, and inadequate public recognition of Yunjin culture, the art faces a decline in market recognition and practitioners, posing a risk to its preservation. Addressing this issue necessitates product innovation, efficient knowledge storage, management, and utilization, and enhancing public cultural identity for Yunjin. Following the government’s “productive conservation” concept for intangible cultural heritage (ICH) projects in the handicraft category, this study uses Yunjin video resources as the primary data source. It constructs a domain knowledge graph (DKG) using an ontological approach to effectively and systematically preserve Yunjin knowledge. Furthermore, the study leverages Neo4j network topology to reveal intricate and diverse relationships within Yunjin knowledge, uncovering rich cultural connotations. Lastly, Cypher is employed for semantic queries, graph visualization, and domain expert evaluation. Evaluation results indicate that the constructed Yunjin DKG meets quality standards, supporting the development of products that align with market aesthetics while preserving Yunjin’s intrinsic cultural values. This approach fosters a complementary relationship between economic benefits and ICH. Additionally, the Yunjin DKG application presents a technical path for knowledge interconnection, integration, and discovery within ICH projects in the handicraft category. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Ontologies are valuable tools for structuring and organizing knowledge, improving communication and data integration, enhancing information retrieval and search, and supporting various applications in different fields. They play a crucial role in promoting shared understanding and knowledge management in complex and information-rich domains. An examination of the initiatives conducted over the past decade in the field of cultural heritage has clearly highlighted the lack of an established framework in the conceptual modeling of information resources, despite the numerous ontologies created as a function of the many projects for the publication of linked open data. As a result, it is far from easy to know exhaustively all the ontologies available in relation to one’s field of interest and to obtain in an easy and systematic way a reliable assessment about their representative capacity and their degree of semantic interoperability. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Digital archives of memory institutions are typically concerned with the cataloguing of artefacts of artistic, historical, and cultural value. However, experiencing cultural heritage requires engaging with the so-called cultural background (historical, social) but also, and possi-bly more importantly, relating the objects (artefacts, artworks, …) to our own experiences and, eventually, the experiences of others, which cannot be forced into a unique, objective meaning. Recently, new forms of citizen participation in cultural heritage have emerged, producing a wealth of material spanning from visitors’ experiential feedback on exhibitions and cultural artefacts to digitally mediated interactions like those on social media platforms. Citizen curation promotes the adoption of intelligent, extended technologies for cultural heritage engagement that mediate the production, collection, interpretation, and archiving of people’s responses to cultural objects, favouring the emergence of multiple, sometimes conflicting viewpoints and motivating the users and memory institutions to reflect upon them. There are good reasons for institutions to archive people’s responses to cultural objects. Therefore, here we focus on the impact of integrating citizen experiences in cultural heritage archives. As we rely on complex systems to support the management of cultural heritage collections and digitally mediated systems to enable innovative engagement applications, it becomes vital to equip underlying infrastructures with means for monitoring, capturing, and explaining what users do with those systems. By analysing the case studies of the EU-funded SPICE project, we argue that a knowledge organ-isation system for “data journeys” can help disentangle problems that include distribution, sense-making, ownership, sensitivity, privacy, and rights management. © 2024, International Society for Knowledge Organization.

AB  - Historic buildings face multi-faceted fire risks that threaten their conservation. A comprehensive fire risk assessment is essential to prevent fires and protect cultural heritage. Conventional practices rely on surveys and site visits, which are inefficient in capturing up-to-date information digitally and analyzing the risk levels quantitatively. This paper proposes a framework integrating Historic Building Information Models (HBIM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to enable automated, data-driven fire risk assessment of historic buildings. The framework consists of two key phases: quantitative fire risk modeling and automated risk assessment. The risk modeling defines unified indicators in accordance with fire safety regulations to quantify the risks exposed to the heritage buildings internally and externally. Both inherent building characteristics (e.g. fire resistance rating) and external spatial characteristics (e.g. adjacent access and spatial separation) were assessed. Next, the automated assessment utilizes HBIM and GIS to extract building and surrounding area information, compute the quantitative risks, and develop an interactive visualization platform to facilitate stakeholders in decision-making. The feasibility of this framework is verified through a case study of Mandarin’s House in Macau. The results indicated the framework is capable of quantifying the risk related to fire-resistant materials (0.66), external access (0.75) and separation (0.76). The results demonstrate that the proposed framework could contribute a unified fire risk model quantification method and a BIM and GIS-combined mechanism for automated risk assessment to support the proactive conservation of valuable cultural heritage assets. © 2024 ISARC.

AB  - [Objective] This paper combines the knowledge graph and reader profiling technology to address the data sparseness and cold start issues of book recommendation. [Context] We examined the proposed model with the library management system of Zhejiang University of Technology, including 220,636 circulation records from May 2020 to May 2022. A total of 60,162 books and 15,916 readers were included in this study. [Methods] First, we constructed a reader-book knowledge graph. Then, we modeled semantic associations between books and reader preferences utilizing book theme modeling and reader profiling. Finally, we explored semantic connections among reader-reader, reader-book, and book-book relationships, strategically addressing data sparsity and cold start challenges. [Results] The proposed method based on GraphSAGE improved the precision by 0.151 compared to the existing collaborative filtering algorithm. Its recall rate reached 51.44% in the cold start environment. [Conclusions] The book recommendation method based on knowledge graph and reader portraits can effectively improve the data sparseness and cold start problem. © 2023 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - With the rapid development of online education, video-based learning has become a significant mode of learning. However, existing video learning tools often fail to fully meet learners' needs for in-depth learning and interactive communication, thereby hindering learning outcomes. To address this challenge, this study proposes and implements an innovative intel-ligent video learning tool named VidBot, which is based on large language models for deep content mining and playback traffic analysis of videos. VidBot integrates Whisper and ChatGLM3-6B language models as well as the Pyltp library to build seven major functional modules, including Video Playback Visualization, Mind Mapping, Knowledge Graph, Cross-referencing of Knowledge Points, Automatic Video Segmentation, Intelligent Tutor, and Shared Notes. These modules aim to provide learners with deeper and more interactive learning experiences. The client of VidBot is released in the form of a plugin, and the server is integrated into the online education platform developed independently by our university.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) witnesses human creativity and wisdom in long histories, composed of a variety of immaterial manifestations. The rapid development of digital technologies accelerates the record of ICH, generating a sheer number of heterogenous data but in a state of fragmentation. To resolve that, existing studies mainly adopt approaches of knowledge graphs (KGs) which can provide rich knowledge representation. However, most KGs are text-based and text-derived, and incapable to give related images and empower downstream multimodal tasks, which is also unbeneficial for the public to establish the visual perception and comprehend ICH completely especially when they do not have the related ICH knowledge. Hence, aimed at that, we propose to, taking the Chinese nation-level ICH list as an example, construct a large-scale and comprehensive Multimodal Knowledge Graph (CICHMKG) combining text and image entities from multiple data sources and give a practical construction framework. Additionally, in this paper, to select representative images for ICH entities, we propose a method composed of the denoising algorithm (CNIFA) and a series of criteria, utilizing global and local visual features of images and textual features of captions. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness. Lastly, we construct the CICHMKG, consisting of 1,774,005 triples, and visualize it to facilitate the interactions and help the public dive into ICH deeply. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Third-party libraries play a crucial role, offering pre-built functionalities and saving developers from starting from scratch. Experienced developers rely on their knowledge, but decision-making can be challenging for others, leading to potential mismatches between selected libraries and project requirements. To address this, an Artificial I ntelligence (AI) approach is proposed, leveraging technologies like Topic Modeling and Knowledge Graph to provide intelligent library rec-ommendations based on user-project ideas. The approach aims to empower developers with data-driven selections, serving as a supportive partner in the software development journey. The evaluation of the AI approach, based on criteria encompassing user satisfaction, accuracy, recommendation comprehensiveness, and alignment with project requirements, serves as a pivotal step in understanding its real-world impact.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Data sharing is becoming ubiquitous and can be advantageous for most biomedical research. However, some data are inherently more amenable to sharing than others. For example, human intracranial neurophysiology recordings and associated multimodal data have unique features that warrant special considerations. The associated data are heterogeneous, difficult to compare, highly specific, and collected from small cohorts with treatment resistant conditions, posing additional complications when attempting to perform generalizable analyses across projects. We present the Data Archive for the BRAIN Initiative (DABI) and describe features of the platform that are designed to overcome these and other challenges. DABI is a data repository and portal for BRAIN Initiative projects that collect human and animal intracranial recordings, and it allows users to search, visualize, and analyze multimodal data from these projects. The data providers maintain full control of data sharing privileges and can organize and manage their data with a user-friendly and intuitive interface. We discuss data privacy and security concerns, example analyses from two DABI datasets, and future goals for DABI. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The Party Central Committee has placed a high priority on the preservation and transfer of cultural heritage in recent years. To this end the Committee has released several significant documents including Opinions on the Implementation of the Project for the Inheritance and Development of Excellent Traditional Chinese Culture which clearly outline the goals and objectives of the preservation of intangible cultural heritage and are extremely significant both historically and practically. The national intangible cultural heritage list has gradually added many areas of the blue calico printing and dyeing procedures. It is discovered that there is some literature on blue calico but there are not many in-depth discussions of the topic. The research angle on blue calico is primarily concentrated on its creative design and application as well as its use in a particular area. The term "comprehensive discussion refers to the fact that all blue calico is included in the summary rather than being restricted to a specific area and there is a dearth of literature that analyzes the data and text that have been transformed into pictures graphs charts and diagrams from the standpoint of visualization. Therefore it is very crucial to create a knowledge map and visualization analysis of the blue calico to comprehend the development state identify research hotspots and forecast the future development trend of the blue calico. Professor Chen Chaomei of the Drexel University in the United States created CiteSpace a Java application for information visualization that has been widely used in a variety of fields. It features a good visualization effect a large amount of information provided simple operation etc. To analyze the literature in the field of blue calico in terms of publications authors and collaboration source journals and institutions keyword clustering mapping and bursts the paper chose journal articles and dissertations from the CNKI database. The paper then used CiteSpace visualization software to analyze the literature and provide a summary of the research content on China' s blue calico over the previous 23 years. Data support for the development of new research directions can be obtained through data visualization and analysis of the existing blue calico research literature from multiple dimensions scientifically and systematically and understanding the current status and hot trends of blue calico research from a macroscopic point of view. It is discovered that there are very few complete works on blue calico and the research varies greatly by location colleges and universities are the primary sources of literature research institutions with the majority of them being collaborations between the same institution and department the design of patterns or motifs protection and inheritance and innovation and development are the keywords that are concentrated in these areas the literature research has undergone three phases the period of exploration the period of development and the period of innovation and inheritance and improving product design cultural and creative products printing and dyeing direction is going to be a major trend in the future. The legacy of blue calico must adapt to the current circumstances while providing effective protection. Achieving a balance between inventive progress and inheritance requires the integration of current technology and digital communication while maintaining the use of natural raw materials traditional techniques and inherited pattern styles. © 2024 China Silk Association.

AB  - In the context of the rapid development of digital academic resources, it is a great challenge to effectively provide researchers and students with appropriate academic resources. In this paper, we intend to build a graph network for academic resources based on GraphSAGE (Graph Sample and Aggregated), and use it as a basis to study the node-based feature learning method improve the accuracy and relevance of the recommendation system. First, the graph network structure is initially established the basis of analyzing the existing electronic information resources such as books and theses in the library. Secondly, based on the null domain-based algorithms such as GraphSAGE, the corresponding feature vectors are extracted from the information such as the association relationship and similarity between data sources. Meanwhile, this paper will also improve the node expression in the graph network by combining the behavioral data such as user habits and online interactions, so as to achieve more personalized and accurate recommendations. Users with ser_ID (Identification) of 2 demonstrated 80 engagement on a resource with Resource_ID of 2, although the popularity of the resource was only 19. The research results in this paper not improve the efficiency of library recommendation of academic literature, but also provide deep mining of literature The research results of this paper will realize more efficient and accurate academic support for university libraries in the of digital transformation. © The Institution of Engineering & Technology 2024.

AB  - Data processing pipelines are a crucial component of any data-centric system today. Machine learning, data integration, and knowledge graph publishing are examples where data processing pipelines are needed. Furthermore, most production systems require data pipelines that support continuous operation and streaming-based capabilities for low-latency computations over large volumes of data. However, creation and maintenance of data processing pipelines is challenging and a lot of effort is usually spent on ad-hoc scripting, which limits reusability across systems. Existing solutions are not interoperable out-of-the-box and do not allow for easy integration of different execution environments (e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript, Rust, etc), while maintaining a streaming operation. For example, combining Python, JavaScript and Java-based libraries natively in a single pipeline is not straightforward. An interoperable and declarative mechanism could allow for continuous communication and integrated execution of data processing functions across different execution environments. We introduce RDF-Connect, a declarative framework based on semantic standards that enables instantiating pipelines with data processing functions across execution environments communicating through well-known communication protocols. We describe its architecture and demonstrate its use for an RDF knowledge graph creation, validation and publishing use case. The declarative nature of our approach facilitates reusability and maintainability of data processing pipelines. We currently support JavaScript and JVM-based environments but we aim to extend RDF-Connect support to other rich ecosystems such as Python and to lower-level languages such as Rust, to take advantage of system-level performance gains. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Risk management and control of on-site power operations is an important link in the power production process. Traditional methods that rely on manual execution of safety rules lack proactive prevention and control capabilities, and insufficient efficiency leads to an increasing frequency of safety issues in power production. Therefore, it is urgent to adopt intelligent methods to improve the level of safety risk management and control. In response to this issue, this paper proposes a multimodal causal knowledge graph based auxiliary decision-making method for safety risk management in power field operations. Based on the characteristics and requirements of safety risk management for on-site power operations, first obtain multimodal data related to safety risk management for on-site power operations, including video, photo, and text information collected by end devices, as well as historical archive data in various system databases. Then, based on historical risk management rules, the causal relationships of the core elements of on-site work safety issues are sorted out, and the data involved in the multiple types of antecedent influencing factors of historical faults and safety accidents are taken as the causes, and the faults and safety issues are taken as the results, forming a complete causal knowledge sample and constructing a causal effect estimation learning model. This model can output the safety risks of on-site power operations, forming a causal knowledge graph to provide auxiliary support for early warning and pre control decision-making of safety risks in on-site power operations.  © 2023 ACM.

AB  - Several recent efforts have been devoted to enhancing pretrained language models (PLMs) by utilizing extra heterogeneous knowledge in knowledge graphs (KGs) and have achieved consistent improvements on various knowledge-driven natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, most of these knowledge-enhanced PLMs, regardless of the domain-specific knowledge required by PLMs, lack a Chinese corpus to support large-scale PLMs, especially in domain-specific PLMs. Herein, we harvest and process public geological reports (mainly various reports from the National Geological Archives of China), abstracts of papers from 34 geological journals, and abstracts of geological dissertations from 161 universities or scientific institutions. This paper introduces a large-scale Chinese geological corpus (GeoCorpus) containing approximately 232 MB of training data with a total of 243 million characters. Based on GeoCorpus, we also introduce a Chinese pretrained language representation model in the geological domain (CnGeoPLM). The model utilizes the generic BERT to complete parameter initialization and combines the GeoCorpus for the second stage of training. We evaluate and test CnGeoPLM and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) on three tasks of geological named entity recognition (GeoNER), geological entity relationship extraction (GeoRE), and geological entity clustering (GeoClu). In the results of both the GeoNER and GeoRE experiments, CnGeoPLM has different degrees of improvement in evaluation metrics compared to BERT. In the GeoClu experiment, CnGeoPLM is significantly more effective and discriminative in entity clustering effect compared to BERT. These results show that CnGeoPLM has a stronger representation ability in geological NLP tasks than BERT. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper evaluates the performance of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms in Neo4j using the Graph Data Science (GDS) and the Awesome Procedures on Cypher (APOC) libraries. We benchmark these algorithms on feature models of varying complexity to assess their efficiency and scalability. Our findings indicate that GDS significantly outperforms APOC in terms of traversal times, particularly for large and complex graphs. This study underscores the importance of algorithm optimization in graph databases and provides insights into practical applications and future directions for improving feature model management in software product lines. © 2024 Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School.

AB  - Background: Question answering (QA) systems for patient-related data can assist both clinicians and patients. They can, for example, assist clinicians in decision-making and enable patients to have a better understanding of their medical history. Substantial amounts of patient data are stored in electronic health records (EHRs), making EHR QA an important research area. Because of the differences in data format and modality, this differs greatly from other medical QA tasks that use medical websites or scientific papers to retrieve answers, making it critical to research EHR QA. Objective: This study aims to provide a methodological review of existing works on QA for EHRs. The objectives of this study were to identify the existing EHR QA datasets and analyze them, study the state-of-the-art methodologies used in this task, compare the different evaluation metrics used by these state-of-the-art models, and finally elicit the various challenges and the ongoing issues in EHR QA. Methods: We searched for articles from January 1, 2005, to September 30, 2023, in 4 digital sources, including Google Scholar, ACL Anthology, ACM Digital Library, and PubMed, to collect relevant publications on EHR QA. Our systematic screening process followed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. A total of 4111 papers were identified for our study, and after screening based on our inclusion criteria, we obtained 47 papers for further study. The selected studies were then classified into 2 non–mutually exclusive categories depending on their scope: “EHR QA datasets” and “EHR QA models.” Results: A systematic screening process obtained 47 papers on EHR QA for final review. Out of the 47 papers, 53% (n=25) were about EHR QA datasets, and 79% (n=37) papers were about EHR QA models. It was observed that QA on EHRs is relatively new and unexplored. Most of the works are fairly recent. In addition, it was observed that emrQA is by far the most popular EHR QA dataset, both in terms of citations and usage in other papers. We have classified the EHR QA datasets based on their modality, and we have inferred that Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) and the National Natural Language Processing Clinical Challenges datasets (ie, n2c2 datasets) are the most popular EHR databases and corpuses used in EHR QA. Furthermore, we identified the different models used in EHR QA along with the evaluation metrics used for these models. Conclusions: EHR QA research faces multiple challenges, such as the limited availability of clinical annotations, concept normalization in EHR QA, and challenges faced in generating realistic EHR QA datasets. There are still many gaps in research that motivate further work. This study will assist future researchers in focusing on areas of EHR QA that have possible future research directions. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Unexplained recurrent implantation failure and the high cost of assisted reproductive techniques for those experiencing infertility have increasingly resulted in the use of acupuncture. However, the trends and research status of acupuncture on infertility resulting in natural conception have not been systematically summarized. This scoping review and knowledge graph analysis aimed to summarize existing clinical studies on acupuncture for infertility that resulted in natural conception. Methods: Seven databases, namely, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang Data, and SinoMed, were searched up to August 2023 (updated on 1 April). Two authors independently identified related clinical studies and systematic reviews, and extracted data from included studies on acupuncture for infertility; any discrepancies were resolved by discussion or judged by a third author. A meta-analysis was conducted based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and data were synthesized using risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Results: Of the 310 articles meeting the inclusion criteria, 274 were primary studies, 7 were systematic reviews, and 29 were case reports. Reported adverse events included mild ovarian irritation and early signs of miscarriage. Out of the 274 primary studies, there were 40 (14.60%) cases of male infertility and 234 (85.40%) cases of female infertility. Current research highlights on acupuncture for infertility focused on female infertility caused by polycystic ovary syndrome, ovulation disorder, and luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome (LUFS), while acupuncture for male infertility was a hotspot in the early research stage. The meta-analysis also suggested that acupuncture was more effective than human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) [RR = 1.89, 95% CI (1.47, 2.42), 11 RCTs, 662 participants]. Acupuncture combined with HCG was comparable to HCG [RR = 2.33, 95% CI (1.53, 3.55), four RCTs, 259 participants]. Compared with no treatment, acupuncture resulted in a higher pregnancy rate [RR = 22.12, 95% CI (1.39, 353.09), one RCT, 47 participants]. There was no statistical difference between acupuncture combined with HCG plus letrozole and HCG plus letrozole [RR = 1.56, 95% CI (0.84, 2.89), one RCT, 84 participants]. Conclusion: Current research highlights on acupuncture for infertility resulting in natural conception focused on female infertility caused by polycystic ovary syndrome, ovulation disorder, and LUFS, while studies on male infertility and female infertility caused by blockage in the fallopian tube, thin endometrium, and other factors were insufficient. Well-designed confirmatory clinical studies are still needed as the research hypotheses of most studies were unclear.

AB  - 3D imaging methods are increasingly employed in cultural heritage research to analyse and document objects in museum collections. In this work, we provide an interactive visualisation plugin for the open-source software Blender, to combine and inspect two complementary 3D imaging modalities: CT images, which capture the interior; and surface scans, which capture the exterior. 3D CT scan data can be visualised, both as volumetric representation and as orthogonal slices, and a 3D surface scan can be registered onto the CT data. It allows users to simultaneously and interactively inspect these modalities and to virtually cut through an object. It also provides tools for generating output images and videos for research and public outreach purposes. The plugin workflow was applied to four case studies from the collections of the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, and the British Museum, London. The plugin is published open-source together with detailed guidelines and a practice dataset. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - There has been a notable increase in research focusing on dynamic selection (DS) techniques within the field of ensemble learning. This leads to the development of various techniques for ensembling multiple classifiers for a specific instance or set of instances during the prediction phase. Despite this progress, the design and development of DS approaches with late fusion settings and their explainability remain unexplored. This work proposes an open-source Python library, Infodeslib, to address this gap. The library provides an implementation of several DS techniques, including four dynamic classifier selections and seven dynamic ensemble selection techniques, all of which are integrated with late data fusion settings and novel explainability features. Infodeslib offers flexibility and customization options, making it a versatile tool for various complex applications that require the fusion of multimodal data and various explainability features. Multimodal data, which integrates information from diverse sources or sensor modalities, is a common and essential setting for real-world problems, enhancing the robustness and depth of data analysis. These data can be fused in two main ways: early fusion, where different modalities are combined at the feature level before model training, and late fusion, where each modality is processed separately and the results are combined at the decision level. The library is fully documented following the Read the Docs standards. The documentation, code, and examples are available anonymously on GitHub at https://github.com/InfoLab-SKKU/infodeslib. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN) is a Swiss research infrastructure initiative that aims to facilitate the exchange of health-related data in a FAIR manner. The SPHN Dataset and SPHN RDF Schema form an essential part of the SPHN Semantic Interoperability Framework, which currently covers mostly clinical routine data. To facilitate the integration of omics data produced by the SPHN National Data Streams, a genomics extension was developed. This was done in close collaboration with clinicians, researchers, bioinformaticians, and data managers, from Swiss university hospitals, academic research groups and the omics platforms. Here, we present the genomics extension of the SPHN RDF Schema, which can be used to semantically describe genomics experiments and covers both clinical and research domains. The schema centers around the general omics process flow, with concepts that denote the individual steps, such as sample processing, assay, and data processing. Genomics-specific specializations are provided, such as library preparation, sequencing assay, and sequencing analysis. The schema also facilitates in capturing other important omics metadata, such as information about the sequencing instrument, standard operating procedure, and quality control metrics. The extension aligns with existing semantic data models and reuses common biomedical vocabularies, such as EDAM, OBI and FAIR genomes, as value sets, thereby facilitating semantic interoperability. It will be used to FAIRify data that is produced within the Swiss network and to facilitate sharing this data as one knowledge graph for reuse among its participants. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Institutional Change for Museums: A Practical Guide to Creating Polyvocal Spaces is an edited volume borne of two questions: (1) What do we want from museums? (2) Why do we (still) care to fight for these visions? Rooted in the concept of polyvocality—the blending of multiple perspectives, experiences, and ideas, where differences and conflicting truths are welcome—this co-written introduction explores these questions and the future potential of museums. The authors begin with their personal “museum journeys.” Representing individuals who grew up going to museums and those who stepped into museums later in life, the journeys challenge singular, universal, homogenous museum practice. The narratives reflect the burgeoning potentials of museums and the authors’ complicated experiences with these institutions while modeling a polyvocal practice and mirror the book’s tone: one that honors multiple truths in various written styles. Following the museum journeys is a theoretical review of polyvocality. The introduction concludes by summarizing the three sections in the volume: Part I, “Interrogating and Redressing Colonial Legacies”; Part II, “Rethinking Structures and Operations”; and Part III, “Agency and Ethics of Care.” Collectively, these sections argue for polyvocality as a necessary concept vital to the future of museums. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Marianna Pegno and Kantara Souffrant; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - This research paper presents the development of a linked open data (LOD) platform that aims to organize and facilitate access to valuable knowledge about folktales and ethnic groups in the Greater Mekong Subregion countries. The study’s methodology involved the creation of a linked open data platform, structuring folktales’ knowledge, and evaluating its performance through expert assessment. The LOD platform was constructed through Google OpenRefine to establish connections with external data sources, and the RDF files (N-Triples) were deployed on Fuseki Server (Apache Jena) to serve as the SPARQL endpoint for querying the linked open data. The Pubby web app was chosen for further development to provide a user-friendly interface, which customized with the Bootstrap framework, featuring an intuitive homepage and a search box function for simplified data retrieval. For the expert evaluation, the study confirmed that the platform performs a high suitability in terms of congruence, reliability, integrity, understandability, collaboration, accessibility, and connectedness. The developed LOD platform exhibits significant potential for expanding its application to various content domains, offering a valuable resource for accessing and exploring the rich cultural heritage of folktales in the Greater Mekong Subregion countries. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Establishing a teaching resource base for English in higher vocational education is one of the effective informatization reform measures. In this paper, the basic framework of English teaching resource base based on a knowledge graph is firstly designed to semantically describe and organize the existing teaching resource organization structure and storage method in the form of a graph based on text semantic coding. Using entity linking technology and knowledge point automated association method, the entity vocabulary in the text is identified and linked to the corresponding entities in the knowledge base to realize the association between teaching resources and knowledge points. Then, the cosine similarity between historical learning resources and teaching resources in terms of semantic features is calculated, and resource recommendation is carried out based on the knowledge connectivity between user interests and resources. The evaluation of the teaching resource library’s performance and its effect on students’ English learning and teachers’ teaching ability is concluded. The results show that users’ evaluations of the indicators of the teaching resource library are concentrated between (3.9-4.4), the p-values of the dimensions of students’ English knowledge in the two cases of yes/no use of the resource library are 0.010, 0.047, 0.038, 0.035, 0.018, and 0.026, and there is a significant variability of the teacher’s teaching ability at the level of 5 percent. This study offers guidance on how to promote the reform of English curriculum construction, optimize teaching resources, and enhance teachers’ overall teaching ability. © 2023 Xiaohua Liang, published by Sciendo.

AB  - The purpose of this entry is to provide an overview of the concept of Linked Open Data (LOD) and to explore its application, advantages, and developments in the cultural heritage domain. It examines the challenges that prevent GLAMs from participating in LOD movements and puts forward suggested measures to overcome such issues. It is apparent that many of the organizations in the cultural heritage domain are involved in implementing LOD. However, GLAMs need to have CH aggregators and experts in the field of LOD to handle and implement them successfully. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Cultural heritage management poses significant challenges for museums due to fragmented data, limited intelligent frameworks, and insufficient applications. In response, a digital cultural heritage management approach based on knowledge graphs and deep learning algorithms is proposed to address the above challenges. A joint entity-relation triple extraction model is proposed to automatically identify entities and relations from fragmented data for knowledge graph construction. Additionally, a knowledge completion model is presented to predict missing information and improve knowledge graph completeness. Comparative simulations have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach for both the knowledge extraction model and the knowledge completion model. The efficacy of the knowledge graph application is corroborated through a case study utilizing ceramic data from the Palace Museum in China. This method may benefit users since it provides automated, interconnected, visually appealing, and easily accessible information about cultural heritage. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This article introduces an innovative digital modelling method tailored for ICH using the functionality of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In order to further improve the performance of CNN, we seamlessly integrated a genetic algorithm (GA) into the system, thus establishing an immersive interactive visual learning environment. This integration utilizes GA's proficiency in conducting comprehensive global searches and its ability to optimize through genetic operations such as crossover and mutation iteratively. The parameters of CNN are fine-tuned based on the fitness value, which represents the most accurate solution with the smallest deviation. This study has achieved remarkable results. Compared with traditional modelling techniques, CAD technology has shown significant advantages in modelling accuracy. In terms of visual teaching, CAD technology enables students to intuitively understand the structure and characteristics of intangible cultural heritage by creating realistic 3D models. This intuitive teaching method not only stimulates students' interest in learning but also helps them gain higher cultural and material value. This method helps to promote a deeper appreciation and understanding of our rich cultural heritage among the younger generation. © 2024 U-turn Press LLC.

AB  - Benefiting from the extensive availability of large-scale knowledge graphs and the improvements in structural methods of question-answering systems, knowledge-based question answering (KBQA) has attracted much attention in the application field of knowledge base. Semantic-parsing-based KBQA methods perform question-answering tasks by executing constructed query graphs on the graph database. However, current semantic-parsing-based KBQA methods still face two non-negligible drawbacks: (1) The semantic-parsing-based methods are usually composed of independent structure prediction and content filling phases, where the structure prediction step lacks effective analysis and utilization of the filled contents. (2) It is still manpower-intensive to convert complex question query labels into equivalent schema structures. To address the challenges above, we propose a structure-and-content dual-driven KBQA method, Mutual Optimization of comBining detaIled and strUctural graphS (MOBIUS), which effectively couples structure prediction with content filling and supports each other to predict the SPARQL trees deconstructed by the official library. The newly generated structure fills in the new data, and the newly added data assists in the generation of the new structure. Then SPARQL trees are used to predict SPARQL queries. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate that our model has achieved good results totally. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

AB  - There is a presumption by some that the removal of certain materials from online repositories can increase 'security through obscurity.' This potentially specious reasoning (as snapshots of these materials may still be available via various digital preservation archives on the surface web as well as the dark web) tends to also be coupled with an underestimation regarding the State-of-the-Art (SOTA) for Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion (STKGC) (i.e., the positing of missing nodes, links, etc.) and the possibility of effectively computing the minimum/optimal Control Energy Cost (CEC) for controlling a Large-Scale Complex Network (LSCN). Prospective vulnerable Real World Scenario (RWS) LSCN include power grids and Artificial Intelligence (AI) compute clusters. This paper discusses a prototype Key Node Identification/Assessment (KNIA) module, which successfully undertook STKGC for a power grid and computed the optimal number of Control Signals (CSopt) operating on an optimal number of Key Control Driver Nodes (KCDNopt) at an optimal CEC (CECopt) over an optimal Elongated Temporal Span (ETSopt) so as to constitute prospective meaningful control over the involved digital rendition LSCN. A bespoke architectural construct, in the form of a Hypergraph-Induced Infimal Convolutional Manifold Neural Network (H-IICMNN), was utilized to resolve the aforementioned KNIA-related CS-KCDN-CEC-ETS optimality problems. By discerning these key pathways, defensive bulwarks for mitigation against certain prospective threat vectors can be formulated and instantiated.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Knowledge sharing practices in academic libraries is increasingly recognised as a tool for competitive advantage and has become a buzz word for enhancing service delivery in academic libraries in Africa. African scholars are increasing conducting research to establish knowledge sharing strategies in libraries. The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions reiterates the value of knowledge sharing techniques in academic libraries. Notwithstanding, knowledge sharing practices are still ad hoc and informal. and academic librarians are still grappling with integrating the different knowledge sharing techniques. This article investigates the perceptions of knowledge sharing among university of Namibia library staff to establish the techniques of knowledge sharing. The overall findings reveal that library staff are aware of the various knowledge sharing techniques in academic libraries but are yet to adopt and integrate these techniques. The findings further revealed a preference to technological-based knowledge sharing techniques over human-based or interpersonal knowledge sharing techniques. This article resonates with the findings of most academic libraries in Africa and therefore adds to the body of knowledge on knowledge sharing in academic libraries from an African perspective. Unlike most studies on knowledge sharing that seeks to establish strategies, this article focuses on establishing perceptions of librarians and the different ways by which techniques for knowledge sharing may be enhanced. © 2024 Academic Conferences Limited.

AB  - With innovative technologies emerging and undergoing rapid iterative updates, the landscape of AI is constantly evolving, encompassing a multifaceted ecosystem that is beyond natural language-based processing and data-generating. Based on the smart data construction scenarios of cultural memory institutions such as galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAMs), this article explores the possibilities, challenges, and paths of the activation, utilization, and innovative inheritance of cultural heritage through generating smart data which has now entered a new phase characterized by high efficiency, in-depth analysis, and multi-modal integration in the new era of AI. The paper first revisits the concept of smart data for cultural heritage. To consider the diverse features of cultural heritage data, the paper introduces the CARE principles (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics) which complement the existing FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) by encouraging open, sustainable, and ethical data movements. Smart data can be efficiently processed using AI technology while also being used by AI to generate intelligent applications and produce high-quality data. Such advancement makes applications for promoting cultural heritage more abundant and practical. The diversity of cultural heritage presents complexities in data processing. This paper sorts five generative patterns for diverse and heterogeneous cultural heritage resources: 1) machine-readable text data, including born-digital or turned-to-digital, unstructured and semi-structured; 2) non-textual data, such as images, sound, scents, objects, etc.; 3) hybrid data contributed by the community; 4) specialized knowledge integration and association; and 5) national level knowledge networks embracing all types of resources. The generation of smart data for GLAMs involves the processes with data structuring, ontology generating, and linked data-driven semantic association and enrichment, culminating in Al-enabled semantic computing. The paper also emphasizes that human intelligence remains crucial in the data modeling and encoding of cultural heritage resources. Human oversight is essential to ensure the credibility, trustiness, and interpretability of the results. Intangible cultural heritage reflects the passion and commitment of this paper. AI has the potential to enhance the efficiency and depth of salvage record-keeping while assisting in the protection of digital archives the creation of knowledge graphs and the innovative dissemination and creative transformation of intangible cultural heritage. Balancing technological advancements with cultural sensitivity will be the key to shaping a future where technology and heritage coexist harmoniously. To overcome the challenges and unlock the full potential of AI in cultural heritage preservation and dissemination generate trustworthy smart data and advance innovative AI-powered applications continuous investment in cross-disciplinary research in digital humanities will be essential. © 2024, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

AB  - Historically, the ability to reproduce visual works in print for comparison and detailed illustration has been crucial for art historical research and its dissemination. While this has always been possible, the study of big monolithic visual heritage can be greatly streamlined by an interactive digital research environment. The goal of our research is to develop an annotation platform that leverages linked open data to facilitate a thorough and scholarly description of big monolithic visual heritage. We will deploy our platform to craft a scholarly edition of the Murten Panorama (1894), offering high-quality, well-provenanced knowledge graph to both the public and scholars, giving them a window into the historical context of the creation of the 19th c. panoramic masterpiece. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Domain-specific data face the long-standing challenge of expressing granular knowledge in a structured way, which is fundamental for fostering information retrieval in the context of domain-specific semantic digital libraries. In the art history field, the ICON ontology strives to face such a challenge by providing a model for describing complex iconographical and iconological interpretations of visual artworks with a high level of granularity. Nevertheless, such a detailed model has drawbacks when applied to extensive real-world data. The need for an extension of the ICON ontology emerged during the creation of 1) the Iconology Dataset, a manually curated dataset representing a selection of the interpretations by the art historian Erwin Panofsky, and 2) IICONGRAPH, a knowledge graph (KG) created by re-engineering the iconographic statements of Wikidata and ArCo. In this work, we present the ontology extension made after the experience of creating such diverse resources. The updates cover two distinct aspects. Whereas some features needed a more thorough description, other interventions sought to simplify the ontology to optimize queries. To this end, we present the motivation for such modeling that emerged from the creation of the Iconology Dataset and IICONGRAPH. We evaluate the newly added features through competency questions and in terms of their efficiency. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - While most previous research focused only on the textual content of documents, advanced support for document management in digital libraries, for open science, requires handling all aspects of a document: from structure, to content, to context. These different but inter-related aspects cannot be handled separately and were traditionally ignored in digital libraries. We propose a graph-based unifying representation and handling model based on the definition of an ontology that integrates all the different perspectives and drives the document description in order to boost the effectiveness of document management. We also show how even simple algorithms can profitably use our proposed approach to return relevant and personalized outcomes in different document management tasks. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Version incompatibility issues are rampant when reusing or reproducing deep learning models and applications. Existing techniques are limited to library dependency specifications declared in PyPI. Therefore, these techniques cannot detect version issues due to undocumented version constraints or issues involving hardware drivers or OS. To address this challenge, we propose to leverage the abundant discussions of DL version issues from Stack Overflow to facilitate version incompatibility detection. We reformulate the problem of knowledge extraction as a Question-Answering (QA) problem and use a pre-trained QA model to extract version compatibility knowledge from online discussions. The extracted knowledge is further consolidated into a weighted knowledge graph to detect potential version incompatibilities when reusing a DL project. Our evaluation results show that (1) our approach can accurately extract version knowledge with 84% accuracy, and (2) our approach can accurately identify 65% of known version issues in 10 popular DL projects with a high precision (92%), while two state-of-the-art approaches can only detect 29% and 6% of these issues with 33% and 17% precision respectively. © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - Nanjing Yunjin, one of China's traditional silk weaving techniques, is renowned for its unique local characteristics and exquisite craftsmanship, and was included in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2009. However, with rapid development in weaving technology, ever-changing market demands, and shifting public aesthetics, Nanjing Yunjin, as an intangible cultural heritage, faces the challenge of survival and inheritance. Addressing this issue requires efficient storage, management, and utilization of Yunjin knowledge to enhance public understanding and recognition of Yunjin culture. In this study, we have constructed an intelligent question-answering system for Nanjing Yunjin digital resources based on knowledge graph, utilizing the Neo4j graph database for efficient organization, storage, and protection of Nanjing Yunjin knowledge, thereby revealing its profound cultural connotations. Furthermore, we adopted deep learning algorithms for natural language parsing. Specifically, we adopted BERT-based intent recognition technology to categorize user queries by intent, and we employed the BERT + BiGRU + CRF model for entity recognition. By comparing with BERT + BILSTM + CRF, BERT + CRF and BILSTM + CRF models, our model demonstrated superior performance in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score, substantiating the superiority and effectiveness of this model. Finally, based on the parsed results of the question, we constructed knowledge graph query statements, executed by the Cypher language, and the processed query results were fed back to the users in natural language. Through system implementation and testing, multiple indices including system response time, stability, load condition, accuracy, and scalability were evaluated. The experimental results indicated that the Nanjing Yunjin intelligent question-answering system, built on the knowledge graph, is able to efficiently and accurately generate answers to user’s natural language queries, greatly facilitating the retrieval and utilization of Yunjin knowledge. This not only reinforces the transmission, promotion, and application of Yunjin culture but also provides a paradigm for constructing other intangible cultural heritage question-answering systems based on knowledge graphs. This has substantial theoretical and practical significance for deeply exploring and uncovering the knowledge structure of human intangible heritage, promoting cultural inheritance and protection. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Objective: The Europeana Digital Library was developed by the countries of the European Union with the aim of providing free online access to cultural heritage from institutions such as museums, libraries, and archives. To this end, Europeana developed the Europeana Data Model (EDM) — an interoperable model for collecting, connecting, and enriching metadata of cultural heritage — and adopted Linked Data practices in its catalog, ensuring interoperability.To discuss the importance of metadata in assisting the construction and curation of thematic collections. Method: This is a bibliographic review aimed at understanding the concepts of data, metadata, Linked data, and Linked open data, as well as the technical and qualitative documentations of Europeana, with the goal of exploring and identifying the relationship between these themes within a collection of artworks by female artists. Results: In general, the metadata from the institutions are reused by Europeana. Conclusions: However, reusing them is not always straightforward, as creating interoperable metadata with quality and consistency is a task that requires investment, specialization, and appropriate tools. Moreover, the absence of gender metadata hinders the creation and curation of special collections, such as grouping artworks by female artists as in the case presented, because the absence of these metadata prevents the separation of artists by gender, thereby reducing diversity in collections in cultural institutions. © 2024, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

AB  - Extracting book-related information from length texts is of great importance as the basis for downstream tasks in the field of graphical intelligence. Book texts are characterized by prominent information features and simple sentences, but few studies have been conducted on the information extraction of book texts. Based on this, this paper proposes an information extraction model that combines entity extraction and rule matching using a BERT pretrained model. The BERT-wwm-ext+CRF model is used as the basis for extracting entities and formulating specific rules for book texts to match the relationships between entities so that the book information can be output as a result of a triplet. Through this method, there are 5 types of entities that can be finally recognized and 4 types of information extracted, which can match the common basic information of books and meet the basic requirements of book information processing. After experimental comparison, the method has good performance in extracting book information and can extract entities and identify entity relationships and attributes from text data more accurately. The final triplets obtained by the model can pave the way for tasks such as building knowledge graphs, thus serving smart libraries. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - The force driving the implementation of Linked Data (LD) technologies in libraries is the aspiration for widespread interoperability of library data and for advanced information services. Toward these goals, libraries change their data models, update their communication formats, and develop prototype applications that use new models and formats and enable entity-based cataloguing. The National Library of Greece (NLG) has been actively adapting its policies, workflows, and tools to make its data LD-ready. Within this context, NLG has developed -in cooperation with Open Knowledge Greece- an entity management prototype using RDA/RDF in a Wikibase instance. The vision is to build a shared entity management system used by all memory institutions in Greece to describe entities of Greek interest. Data is to be stored as a knowledge graph that can be exported in RDF serializations, and in legacy MARC format. This paper first examines related efforts from other National Libraries, and then outlines the steps involved in the publication of the NLG Authority File as linked data; namely dataset selection, modeling, data curation, mapping, and publication. The development of the NLG entity management prototype is also presented. The paper concludes with challenges, lessons learned, and next steps. © 2024 Sofia Zapounidou, Lazaros Ioannidis, Michalis Gerolimos, Eftychia Koufakou and Charalampos Bratsas.

AB  - Nowadays, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are important and developing in different areas. However, there is a lack of genuinely interoperable datasets representing mathematics that allow for information exchange between datasets in the Web ecosystem. In this paper, we address this matter based on the Mizar Mathematical Library (MML), a collection of articles written in the Mizar language. MML includes definitions and theorems with proofs to which authors can easily refer from newly written Mizar articles. However, extracting information directly from Mizar scripts by external projects is not very straightforward. Therefore, we propose a new data storage and retrieval approach based on the Knowledge Organization System (KOS) model and the KG concept that provides a way to organize and access knowledge. We present Mizar Mathematical Library Knowledge Graph (MMLKG), a thesaurus for describing mathematical objects. MMLKG supports semantic interoperability and allows linking data from different sources, e.g., Wikidata. Moreover, it satisfies the FAIR data principles. The data is publicly available via a Cypher endpoint. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The silk culture in modern China from 1949 to 1988 is a cultural and economic microcosm of China' s transition from the nascent democracy to the exploration of socialism and later to the historical process of reform and opening up. Although the silk culture of this period is preserved by different types of media, such as literature, archives, and objects, which reconstruct the cultural memory under the historical context and social framework, it also faces problems such as the inevitable fading of individual memories, the dispersed yet diluted media attention, and the inefficient passing of generational memories. Activating the memory of silk culture in modern China has the practical importance of protecting and inheriting the illustrious traditional Chinese culture, strengthening national cultural identity, and establishing national cultural confidence. With the continuous development of technology and its successful application in the cultural field, the integration of digital design and digital media has become a new topic for activating the memory of silk culture in modern China.The methods used in this study include literature research, interdisciplinary research, and practical research. To meet the needs of the research direction, the article extensively collected and organized domestic and foreign literature related to cultural memory theory and conducted longitudinal and horizontal comparisons to extract content that has enlightening significance and value for constructing the memory of silk culture in modern China. The article also analyzed successful cases of cultural digital design in China. Guided by the core theory of cultural memory, the article proposed a framework to reconstruct the memory of silk culture in modern China. The transformation from traditional memory media (such as texts, images, and places) to digital media (such as knowledge graphs, apps, and virtual exhibition halls) is one of the focal points of the study. This article documents the digital design practice for the memory of silk culture in modern China while exploring the organic connection among silk culture, design, and cultural memory.By combing and reconstructing the memory connotation and memory media of the silk culture in modern China, using digital design methods such as information visualization design, APP interactive design, and 3D virtual scene design, this article constructs an organic whole of culture and memory, encompassing both individual and collectivity, virtuality and reality. It guides the audience to establish cultural memory and awaken cultural identity based on the cultural information conveyed by design, thus realizing the replication, reproduction, and resurrection of the memory of silk culture in modern China and exploring new ideas and paths for activating its memory.This article expands the application field of cultural memory theory, provides a theoretical basis for the inheritance and dissemination of silk culture in modern China, and reorganizes its internal structure from the dimensions of memory connotation and memory media. It reconstructs the memory of silk culture in modern China and highlights its cultural memory value. In the future, the in-depth exploration and application of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality will bestow digital design with more possibilities of integration with Chinese silk culture. © 2024 China Silk Association.

AB  - Introduction: Modern forestry increasingly relies on the management of large datasets, such as forest inventories and land cover maps. Governments are typically in charge of publishing these datasets, but they typically employ disparate data formats (sometimes proprietary ones) and published datasets are commonly disconnected from other sources, including previous versions of such datasets. As a result, the usage of forestry data is very challenging, especially if we need to combine multiple datasets. Methods and results: Semantic Web technologies, standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), have emerged in the last decades as a solution to publish heterogeneous data in an interoperable way. They enable the publication of self-describing data that can easily interlink with other sources. The concepts and relationships between them are described using ontologies, and the data can be published as Linked Data on the Web, which can be downloaded or queried online. National and international agencies promote the publication of governmental data as Linked Open Data, and research fields such as biosciences or cultural heritage make an extensive use of Semantic Web technologies. In this study, we present the result of the European Cross-Forest project, addressing the integration and publication of national forest inventories and land cover maps from Spain and Portugal using Semantic Web technologies. We used a bottom-up methodology to design the ontologies, with the goal of being generalizable to other countries and forestry datasets. First, we created an ontology for each dataset to describe the concepts (plots, trees, positions, measures, and so on) and relationships between the data in detail. We converted the source data into Linked Open Data by using the ontology to annotate the data such as species taxonomies. As a result, all the datasets are integrated into one place this is the Cross-Forest dataset and are available for querying and analysis through a SPARQL endpoint. These data have been used in real-world use cases such as (1) providing a graphical representation of all the data, (2) combining it with spatial planning data to reveal the forestry resources under the management of Spanish municipalities, and (3) facilitating data selection and ingestion to predict the evolution of forest inventories and simulate how different actions and conditions impact this evolution. Discussion: The work started in the Cross-Forest project continues in current lines of research, including the addition of the temporal dimension to the data, aligning the ontologies and data with additional well-known vocabularies and datasets, and incorporating additional forestry resources.

AB  - The research uses the FAIR principle from the perspective of libraries to construct a reliable data selection and evaluation model for the study of the relationship between science and technology, in order to solve the problems of insufficient utilization of other data and unclear application logic, which mainly rely on paper and patent data in current research. Three issues are discussing in the paper: the format and interaction methods of multimodal data, the construction of indicator system, and the evaluation process. The result shows that the index construction method based on metadata interoperability is beneficial for the fusion of metadata layer, and use ontology to achieve semantic fusion, and identified scientific and technological relationships by multimodal data jointly. © 2024 Dublin Core metadata initiative.

AB  - Cultural gems is a web application conceived by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (DG JRC), which aims at engaging people and organizations across Europe to create a unique repository of cultural and creative places. The main goal is to provide a vision of European culture in order to strengthen a sense of identity within a single European cultural realm. Cultural gems maps more than 130,000 physical places in over 300 European cities and towns, and since 2020 it also lists online cultural initiatives. The new release aims, among other, to increase the interoperability of the application. At this purpose, we provide an overview on the current development of an ontology for Cultural gems used to map cultural heritage in European cities by using Linked Open Data (LOD) standards and making the data FAIR, that is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. We provide an overview of the methodology, presenting the structure of the ontology, and the services and tools we are currently building on top. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - The integration of 3D geometric models with semantic information significantly improves the applicability and comprehensibility of cultural heritage. The semantic 3D modeling of Chinese grottoes poses challenges for individuals without expertise in cultural heritage due to gaps in domain knowledge and discrepancies in understanding. However, the existing domain ontology and knowledge graph provide an insufficient representation of the knowledge of Chinese grottoes. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a knowledge graph representation method to provide explicit knowledge for participants at different stages of semantic 3D modeling of Chinese grottoes, which includes schema layer construction and data layer construction. On the schema layer, we design a domain ontology named ChgOnto (Chinese Grottoes Ontology) that consists of four high-level concept classes: spatial object, informational object, digital device, and temporal object. Among the classes in the ChgOnto, the components (e.g., cliff wall, cave roof, cliff wall footing), elements (e.g., primary Buddha statue, pedestal, decoration), the properties (e.g., length, width, depth) of caves and niches in Chinese grottoes as well as the spatial relationships between them are all precisely defined. ChgOnto also reuse the classes from the renowned CIDOC CRM ontology in the cultural heritage field and GeoSPARQL in the geospatial domain, facilitating integration between the two subjects. Considering the schema layer as the conceptual data model, the data layer extracts knowledge from unstructured text through natural language processing tools to instantiate the abstract classes and fill the properties of the schema layer. Finally, the knowledge required for semantic 3D modeling of Chinese grottoes is expressed in the data layer by a knowledge graph in a fixed expression form. Dazu Rock Carvings, a World Heritage site in China, is selected as a case study to validate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results reveal that our method offers a robust knowledge-sharing platform for the semantic 3D modeling of Chinese grottoes and demonstrates excellent scalability. The method proposed in this paper can also serve as an informative reference for other types of cultural heritage. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Based on various measurements, the condition assessment of power transformers ensures transformer reliability for achieving a stable power supply and improves economic benefits. However, the existing methods suffer from artificially summarized rules, heavy data dependence, incomprehensive measurement analysis, superficial information fusion, or unexplainable assessment results. Therefore, an interpretable joint inference method based on subsystem measurements is proposed to automatically extract the knowledge and data features, enabling profound information fusion and reducing the impact of poor-quality data. First, the sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) extract features from the subsystem condition data and the archive knowledge graph (KG) representing the maintenance histories, respectively. Next, the method assigns weights to the features according to the mask vectors. Then, a Bayesian neural network (BNN) analyzes uncertainties to recognize the condition grade, and the health index (HI) is calculated through fitting distributions and Monte Carlo sampling. Finally, a local interpretable model is designed to interpret the decisions made by the proposed method. Verified by experiments, the proposed method achieves an F-measure of 97.28% on grade recognition, which is 20.94% higher than contrast models. Moreover, the method is also proven to outperform the other models in dealing with disturbed and incomplete data.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Institutional Change for Museums: A Practical Guide to Creating Polyvocal Spaces defines polyvocality as 'the blending of multiple perspectives, experiences, and ideas, where differences and conflicting truths are welcome. A polyvocal museum is thus 'co-informed by museum workers, visitors, and communities. Fittingly, the conclusion to this volume is a collective guide to building a polyvocal museum culled from the knowledge gathered from the volume contributors. The expertise of the artists, community members, curators, scholars, and cultural workers featured in this book are compiled to provide actionable steps that can be extended, adapted, and played with to build polyvocal museums that embrace dialogues and difficult conversations in the pursuit of museums that will outlast us all: one expansive enough to dream, to remain curious, and to gather us in the service of collective transformation. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Marianna Pegno and Kantara Souffrant; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Datasets of reported damaged properties are vital for resilience efforts during and after wars. They are essential for the statistical analysis of damages and the distribution of funds and resources. This paper concentrates on these datasets to enhance the resilience of Ukraine's damaged cultural heritage sites and infrastructures as a result of the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war. More specifically, we use a semiautomatic approach to enrich such datasets and a linked data approach to improve the quality of published datasets and facilitate their integration. We demonstrate our approach by using a well cited dataset published by the UNESCO for damaged cultural properties and the ScienceAtRisk project for damaged educational and research infrastructures. Our final datasets consist of 2,910 and 389 triples respectively. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our datasets with three use cases. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Vulnerable third-party libraries pose significant threats to software applications that reuse these libraries. At an industry scale of reuse, manual analysis of third-party library vulnerabilities can be easily overwhelmed by the sheer number of vulnerabilities continually collected from diverse sources for thousands of reused libraries. Our study of four large-scale, actively maintained vulnerability databases (NVD, IBM X-Force, ExploitDB, and Openwall) reveals the wide presence of information discrepancies, in terms of seven vulnerability aspects, i.e., product, version, component, vulnerability type, root cause, attack vector, and impact, between the reports for the same vulnerability from heterogeneous sources. It would be beneficial to integrate and cross-validate multi-source vulnerability information, but it demands automatic aspect extraction and aspect discrepancy detection. In this work, we experimented with a wide range of NLP methods to extract named entities (e.g., product) and free-form phrases (e.g., root cause) from textual vulnerability reports and to detect semantically different aspect mentions between the reports. Our experiments confirm the feasibility of applying NLP methods to automate aspect-level vulnerability analysis and identify the need for domain customization of general NLP methods. Based on our findings, we propose a discrepancy-aware, aspect-level vulnerability knowledge graph and a KG-based web portal that integrates diversified vulnerability key aspect information from heterogeneous vulnerability databases. Our conducted user study proves the usefulness of our web portal. Our study opens the door to new types of vulnerability integration and management, such as vulnerability portraits of a product and explainable prediction of silent vulnerabilities.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) organisations host extensive digital collections that have been made available to the public for over three decades. Advances in technology have facilitated the reuse of digital collections as rich data sources. In this context, Wikidata has emerged as a leading, innovative, and collaborative platform that enriches the digital collections provided by GLAM institutions. However, a comprehensive analysis of the current status, potential and challenges of its use in the GLAM sector is still lacking. This paper presents a systematic review of Wikidata use in GLAM institutions within the context of the work of the International GLAM Labs Community (glamlabs.io). The results summarise academic literature on Wikidata projects. The paper argues that Wikidata’s potential in the domain of reuse, an important component of the FAIR principles, can be better integrated into the practices of GLAM institutions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - When designing data-driven web applications, users’ informative needs are aligned to knowledge organization (KO) requirements, which are secondly mapped to user interfaces (UI) components, and finally to user experience (UX) journeys. Particularly, when data are served as Linked Open Data, data and user requirements can be associated with competency questions that an ontology should address. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no full-fledged methodology that systematically adopts ontology requirements to design UI components and UX journeys. In this article we propose a methodology to design web applications for information seeking purposes that leverages well-known ontology design methodologies and UI/UX approaches. We present a case study based on music heritage and we evaluate it via a user study. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - The significant business requirement for organizations utilizing technology-based services is the production of appropriate services and applications according to business needs, and the sustainable operation of the infrastructures providing these services. Even as organizations increasingly procure services externally due to new technological advancements, there remains a need to monitor Information Technology structures, configuration, and version requirements. The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and its subset, the Configuration Management Database (CMDB), provide a roadmap for these approaches. However, as technologies advance, this management need can become even more complex. Recently, with the increasing use of graph-based perspectives, both in artificial intelligence studies and in relational complex systems such as social networks and network structures, managing definitions in multidimensional space systems, such as objects in knowledge management systems using graph algorithms, has become easier. Within these studies, well-known artificial intelligence tasks such as prediction, classification, or anomaly detection can be more controllable. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Threat modeling for systems relying on Artificial In-telligence is not well explored. While conventional threat modeling methods and tools do not address AI-related threats, research on this amalgamation still lacks solutions capable of guiding and automating the process, as well as providing evidence that the methods hold up in practice. Consequently, this paper presents ThreatFinderAI, an approach and tool providing guidance and automation to model AI-related assets, threats, countermeasures, and quantify residual risks. To do so, ThreatFinderAI presents a novel AI-based stencil library for automated asset extraction, a threat knowledge graph spanning several community initiatives, and a novel method to identify business impacts of AI threats and an approach to quantify them. To evaluate the practicality of the approach, participants were tasked to recreate a threat model developed by cybersecurity experts of an AI-based healthcare platform. Secondly, the approach was used to identify and discuss strategic risks in an LLM-based application through a case study. Overall, the solution's usability was well-perceived and effectively supports threat identification and risk discussion. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Traditional Wooden Carving in Quanzhou, China is a National Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH), which was established in Tang Dynasty (AD 686), and has a history of more than a thousand years. It is a narrative presentation of the life, culture and other daily respects of the people in southern Fujian province. The project focuses on the Wooden Carving Window Decoration in Southern Fujian Ancient Building, by using AI technology to extract features of the landscape, figures and various types of rare, exotic creatures in wooden carvings, their digital 3D models can be generated and presented, a comprehensive database of elements of wooden window carving can also be built. Furthermore, the human–computer interaction is supported by hand gesture recognition technology, allowing participants creatively design their own contemporary digitalized wood window carving. This project expects the interactive and narrative features of the digital wooden window carving model can trigger a deeper sense of identification with the traditional southern Fujian culture among the young generation and erase the distant feeling towards traditional ICH culture spatially and temporally. Moreover, it could also provide a new way of thinking for the innovative inheritance of ICH. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Advances in high-throughput genome sequencing have enabled large-scale genome sequencing in clinical practice and research studies. By analyzing genomic variants of humans, scientists can gain better understanding of the risk factors of complex diseases such as cancer and COVID-19. To model and analyze the rich genomic data, knowledge graphs (KGs) and graph machine learning (GML) can be regarded as enabling technologies. In this article, we present a scalable tool called VariantKG for analyzing genomic variants of humans modeled using KGs and GML. Specifically, we used publicly available genome sequencing data from patients with COVID-19. VariantKG extracts variant-level genetic information output by a variant calling pipeline, annotates the variant data with additional metadata, and converts the annotated variant information into a KG represented using the Resource Description Framework (RDF). The resulting KG is further enhanced with patient metadata and stored in a scalable graph database that enables efficient RDF indexing and query processing. VariantKG employs the Deep Graph Library (DGL) to perform GML tasks such as node classification. A user can extract a subset of the KG and perform inference tasks using DGL. The user can monitor the training and testing performance and hardware utilization. We tested VariantKG for KG construction by using 1,508 genome sequences, leading to 4 billion RDF statements. We evaluated GML tasks using VariantKG by selecting a subset of 500 sequences from the KG and performing node classification using well-known GML techniques such as GraphSAGE, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Graph Transformer. VariantKG has intuitive user interfaces and features enabling a low barrier to entry for KG construction, model inference, and model interpretation on genomic variants of humans.

AB  - Background: The PubMed archive contains more than 34 million articles; consequently, it is becoming increasingly difficult for a biomedical researcher to keep up-to-date with different knowledge domains. Computationally efficient and interpretable tools are needed to help researchers find and understand associations between biomedical concepts. The goal of literature-based discovery (LBD) is to connect concepts in isolated literature domains that would normally go undiscovered. This usually takes the form of an A–B–C relationship, where A and C terms are linked through a B term intermediate. Here we describe Serial KinderMiner (SKiM), an LBD algorithm for finding statistically significant links between an A term and one or more C terms through some B term intermediate(s). The development of SKiM is motivated by the observation that there are only a few LBD tools that provide a functional web interface, and that the available tools are limited in one or more of the following ways: (1) they identify a relationship but not the type of relationship, (2) they do not allow the user to provide their own lists of B or C terms, hindering flexibility, (3) they do not allow for querying thousands of C terms (which is crucial if, for instance, the user wants to query connections between a disease and the thousands of available drugs), or (4) they are specific for a particular biomedical domain (such as cancer). We provide an open-source tool and web interface that improves on all of these issues. Results: We demonstrate SKiM’s ability to discover useful A–B–C linkages in three control experiments: classic LBD discoveries, drug repurposing, and finding associations related to cancer. Furthermore, we supplement SKiM with a knowledge graph built with transformer machine-learning models to aid in interpreting the relationships between terms found by SKiM. Finally, we provide a simple and intuitive open-source web interface (https://skim.morgridge.org) with comprehensive lists of drugs, diseases, phenotypes, and symptoms so that anyone can easily perform SKiM searches. Conclusions: SKiM is a simple algorithm that can perform LBD searches to discover relationships between arbitrary user-defined concepts. SKiM is generalized for any domain, can perform searches with many thousands of C term concepts, and moves beyond the simple identification of an existence of a relationship; many relationships are given relationship type labels from our knowledge graph. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The paper presents a new multimodal approach to analyzing the psycho-emotional state of a person using nonlinear classifiers. The main modalities are the subject’s speech data and video data of facial expressions. Speech is digitized and transcribed using the Scribe library, and then mood cues are extracted using the Titanis sentiment analyzer from the FRC CSC RAS. For visual analysis, two different approaches were implemented: a pre-trained ResNet model for direct sentiment classification from facial expressions, and a deep learning model that integrates ResNet with a graph-based deep neural network for facial recognition. Both approaches have faced challenges related to environmental factors affecting the stability of results. The second approach demonstrated greater flexibility with adjustable classification vocabularies, which facilitated post-deployment calibration. Integration of text and visual data has significantly improved the accuracy and reliability of the analysis of a person’s psycho-emotional state. © 2024 Kiselev, G. A., Lubysheva, Y.

AB  - Complex demands in the field of cultural heritage preservation often require a multidisciplinary approach and substantial volumes of multimodal data integration and management. The conventional approach to tackling these issues revolves around using different H-BIM (historical building information model) solutions. This paper presents a prototype for a web platform that moves closer to the idea of a digital twin for physical cultural assets. Based on a light development framework, it is designed for online open access and features a versatile custom 3D viewer for intuitive interaction with the presented data. The concept requires a workflow similar to the video-game industry’s 3D asset optimization to generate highly detailed 3D models and to facilitate the display of multilayered imaging data. The technological stack features a minimal MVC architecture framework and front-end stylesheets. It is designed to be independent of specific databases, enhancing portability for potential future open-source releases. Moreover, the platform employs WebGL libraries to create a dynamic 3D environment interaction. The capabilities of the web platform were tested in a case study regarding the documentation of an important 17th-century church in Romania. Further developments and current limitations of the platform are also discussed. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This paper offers an overview of the first step in the data alignment and joint research efforts between the Japanese Visual Media Graph (JVMG) and the Graphs and Ontologies for Literary Evolution Models (GOLEM) projects. Focusing on fully or in-part anime based fandoms in the Archive of Our Own (AO3) data in the GOLEM knowledge graph we connected 534 fandoms with 1,734 anime works from the JVMG knowledge graph. The fanfiction publication numbers and dates for these fandoms were then analyzed in conjunction with the various metadata available on the corresponding anime works, such as release date, genre, content rating and user rating. Fixed effects modeling was employed to identify a positive effect of anime releases on fanfiction publication numbers. Furthermore, individual graphs of the top four hundred fandoms’ fanfiction publication numbers over time overlayed with the corresponding anime release dates were also analyzed manually to identify a number of distinct patterns, as well as groups of fandoms for which the invigorating effect of anime releases on fanfiction publication numbers could be clearly identified. © 2024, University of Akron Press.

AB  - Silk holds significant historical importance in European history, fostering economic growth, innovation in weaving techniques, and the creation of exceptional artifacts. Despite the conservation efforts of numerous institutions, silk heritage remains at risk due to its fragile nature. This paper outlines the methodology employed by the Horizon 2020 SILKNOW project aimed at enhancing the promotion and preservation of silk-related cultural heritage collections. We present the development of a CIDOC CRM-based data model for the creation of a comprehensive knowledge graph. We also introduce the SILKNOW extension, designed to encapsulate the intricate semantics associated with the production processes of silk fabrics. Our results demonstrate the potential of Semantic Web technologies in safeguarding and enriching the visibility of silk heritage through improved data interoperability and accessibility. © 2024, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

AB  - Institutional Change for Museums: A Practical Guide to Creating Polyvocal Spaces is an edited volume borne of two questions: (1) What do we want from museums? (2) Why do we (still) care to fight for these visions? Rooted in the concept of polyvocality—the blending of multiple perspectives, experiences, and ideas, where differences and conflicting truths are welcome—this co-written introduction explores these questions and the future potential of museums. The authors begin with their personal “museum journeys.” Representing individuals who grew up going to museums and those who stepped into museums later in life, the journeys challenge singular, universal, homogenous museum practice. The narratives reflect the burgeoning potentials of museums and the authors’ complicated experiences with these institutions while modeling a polyvocal practice and mirror the book’s tone: one that honors multiple truths in various written styles. Following the museum journeys is a theoretical review of polyvocality. The introduction concludes by summarizing the three sections in the volume: Part I, “Interrogating and Redressing Colonial Legacies”; Part II, “Rethinking Structures and Operations”; and Part III, “Agency and Ethics of Care.” Collectively, these sections argue for polyvocality as a necessary concept vital to the future of museums. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Marianna Pegno and Kantara Souffrant; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) accurately at an early stage is critical for planning and implementing disease-modifying treatments that can help prevent the progression to severe stages of the disease. In the existing literature, diagnostic test scores and clinical status have been provided for specific time points, and predicting the disease progression poses a significant challenge. However, few studies focus on longitudinal data to build deep-learning models for AD detection. These models are not stable to be relied upon in real medical settings due to a lack of adaptive training and testing. We aim to predict the individual's diagnostic status for the next six years in an adaptive manner where prediction performance improves with the number of patient visits. This study presents a Sequence-Length Adaptive Encoder-Decoder Long Short-Term Memory (SLA-ED LSTM) deep-learning model on longitudinal data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative archive. In the suggested approach, decoder LSTM dynamically adjusts to accommodate variations in training sequence length and inference length rather than being constrained to a fixed length. We evaluated the model performance for various sequence lengths and found that for inference length one, sequence length nine gives the highest average test accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.920 and 0.982, respectively. This insight suggests that data from nine visits effectively captures meaningful cognitive status changes and is adequate for accurate model training. We conducted a comparative analysis of the proposed model against state-of-the-art methods, revealing a significant improvement in disease progression prediction over the previous methods.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The Locarno Film Festival (LFF) archives represent a valuable collection of cinematic history, providing essential resources for research, education, and the promotion of international film culture. To ensure these resources are easily accessible, it is crucial to develop advanced methods for managing and linking the information they contain. This work focuses on creating a shared way for organizing information, transforming the LFF archives into dynamic, interconnected resources. This transformation is essential for preserving cinematic heritage, improving discoverability, promoting digital transformation, and efficiently managing archives. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we developed the OntoFest following the Linked Open Terms (LOT) Methodology. Significant outcomes of this project include the successful reuse of existing ontologies to manage heterogeneous information, which has improved our ability to understand and retrieve relevant data. This work demonstrates the potential of digital archives in the cinematic field and provides a foundation for future initiatives in digitizing cinematic heritage archives. OntoFest not only contributes to preserving the cinematic cultural heritage of the LFF but also lays the groundwork for new research and creative applications in the digital transformation of film festival archives. © 2024 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - In the last two decades, Cultural Heritage institutions have been revisiting the way they publish their data. Due to the rise of Semantic Web technologies and graph-based search engines, the shift in the technology stack has required many to reconsider the way their data is organised. The appreciable byproduct of this phenomenon has been the development of data literacy skills among cataloguers, archivists, and collection managers, who were in turn promised a revamp of the archival institution’s image in terms of authoritativeness (due to the improved data quality) and attractiveness towards patrons (due to the enhanced search capabilities). In this article we describe how photo archives have embraced such a new paradigm, and we discuss benefits and limitations, moving from a representative example, i.e., ZERI & LODe, a project devoted to the publication of the catalogue of the Federico Zeri Photo Archive into Linked Open Data. The focus of the analysis is the added value promised by Semantic Web technologies and the Open Data business model to cataloguers, scholars, and arts enthusiasts.

AB  - Library migration, which replaces the current library with a different one to retain the same software behavior, is common in software evolution. An essential part of this is finding an analogous API for the desired functionality. However, due to the multitude of libraries/APIs, manually finding such an API is time-consuming and error-prone. Researchers created automated analogical API recommendation techniques, notably documentation-based methods. Despite potential, these methods have limitations, e.g., incomplete semantic understanding in documentation and scalability issues. In this study, we present KGE4AR, a novel documentation-based approach using knowledge graph (KG) embedding for recommending analogical APIs during library migration. KGE4AR introduces a unified API KG to comprehensively represent documentation knowledge, capturing high-level semantics. It further embeds this unified API KG into vectors for efficient, scalable similarity calculation. We assess KGE4AR with 35,773 Java libraries in two scenarios, with and without target libraries. KGE4AR notably outperforms state-of-the-art techniques (e.g., 47.1%-143.0% and 11.7%-80.6% MRR improvements), showcasing scalability with growing library counts. © 2023 ACM.

AB  - The ImageCLEF evaluation campaign was integrated with CLEF (Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum) for more than 20 years and represents a Multimedia Retrieval challenge aimed at evaluating the technologies for annotation, indexing, and retrieval of multimodal data. Thus, it provides information access to large data collections in usage scenarios and domains such as medicine, argumentation and content recommendation. ImageCLEF 2024 has four main tasks: (i) a Medical task targeting automatic image captioning for radiology images, synthetic medical images created with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Visual Question Answering and medical image generation based on text input, and multimodal dermatology response generation; (ii) a joint ImageCLEF-Touché task Image Retrieval/Generation for Arguments to convey the premise of an argument, (iii) a Recommending task addressing cultural heritage content-recommendation, and (iv) a joint ImageCLEF-ToPicto task aiming to provide a translation in pictograms from natural language. In 2023, participation increased by 67% with respect to 2022 which reveals its impact on the community. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - This paper presents the proposed ontology for the project “Computational Approaches for Addressing Problematic Terminology” (CAAPT). This schema seeks to represent contents and structure of language guideline documents produced by cultural heritage institutions seeking to engage with critical cataloguing or reparative description work, known as terminology guidance documents. It takes the Victoria and Albert Museum Terminology Guidance Document as a source for the initial modelling work. Ultimately, CAAPT seeks to expand the knowledge graph beyond the context of the Victoria and Albert Museum to incorporate additional terminology guidance documents and linked open data vocabularies. The ontology seeks to bring together scholarly communities in areas relevant to this project, most notably those in cultural heritage and linguistics linked open data, by leveraging existing linked data resources in these areas: as such, OntoLex, CIDOC CRM, and SKOS are used as a foundation for this work, along with a proposed schema from a related project, CULCO. As the CAAPT project is in early stages, this paper presents the preliminary results of work undertaken thus far in order to seek feedback from the linguistics linked open data community. © 2024 ELRA Language Resource Association.

AB  - Automatic storytelling is a broad challenge in research contexts such as Natural Language Processing and Contend Based Image Analysis. Despite the considerable achievements of machine learning techniques in these research fields, combining different approaches to fill the gap between an automatic generated story and human handwriting is hard. This work proposes a novel storytelling framework in the Cultural Heritage domain. We developed our framework based on a Multimedia Knowledge Graph (MKG), a crucial point of our work. Furthermore, we populated our Multimedia Knowledge Graph with a focused crawler that employs deep learning techniques to recognise a multimedia object from web resources. Furthermore, we used a combined approach of deep learning techniques and Linked Open Data (LOD) to retrieve information about images and depicted figures using Instance Segmentation. The system has a dynamic, user-friendly interface that guides the user during the storytelling process. Finally, we evaluated the system from a qualitative and quantitative point of view. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Collaborative data collection initiatives are increasingly becoming pivotal to cultural institutions and scholars, to boost the population of born-digital archives. For over a decade, organisations have been leveraging Semantic Web technologies to design their workflows, ensure data quality, and a means for sharing and reusing (Linked Data). Crucially, scholarly projects that leverage cultural heritage data to collaboratively develop new resources would benefit from agile solutions to simplify the Linked Data production workflow via user-friendly interfaces. To date, only a few pioneers have abandoned legacy cataloguing and archiving systems to fully embrace the Linked Open Data (LOD) paradigm and manage their catalogues or research products through LOD-native management systems. In this article we present Crowdsourcing Linked Entities via web Form (CLEF), an agile LOD-native platform for collaborative data collection, peer-review, and publication. We detail design choices as motivated by two case studies, from the Cultural Heritage and scholarly domains respectively, and we discuss benefits of our solution in the light of prior works. In particular, the strong focus on user-friendly interfaces for producing FAIR data, the provenance-aware editorial process, and the integration with consolidated data management workflows, distinguish CLEF as a novel attempt to develop Linked Data platforms for cultural heritage.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Geographic information and the mapping analysis of scientific knowledge have proven to be effective for the management and monitoring of built heritage. To understand built heritage and the urban cultural space, this study incorporates the following integrated data: public surveys, researchers’ knowledge graphs, and urban map information. Firstly, the urban map of Quanzhou is used to analyze the spatial distribution of cultural heritage points. Secondly, Citespace literature co-citation analysis technology is used to establish a preliminary evaluation index of urban culture governance. Thirdly, a questionnaire survey was conducted on the creative economy and urban culture space, and a theoretical model of the urban culture ecosystem was established using Amos software, which includes six dimensions of “cultural inclusiveness, cultural sustainability, cultural integrity, cultural creativity, and cultural vitality”. Finally, a comparative analysis is conducted on the number of visitors to different types of cultural public spaces in Quanzhou City. The results show that exemplary local knowledge and deep historical memory are core elements for building an ideal cultural ecosystem and are necessary to promote cities toward a sustainable future. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - One of the key AI tools for textual corpora exploration is natural language question-answering (QA). Unlike keyword-based search engines, QA algorithms receive and process natural language questions and produce precise answers to these questions, rather than long lists of documents that need to be manually scanned by the users. State-of-the-art QA algorithms based on DNNs were successfully employed in various domains. However, QA in the genealogical domain is still underexplored, and researchers in this field (and other fields in humanities and social sciences) can highly benefit from the ability to ask questions in natural language, receive concrete answers, and gain insights hidden within large corpora. While some research has been recently conducted for factual QA in the genealogical domain, to the best of our knowledge, there is no previous research on the more challenging task of numerical aggregation QA (i.e., answering questions combining aggregation functions, e.g., count, average, max). Numerical aggregation QA is critical for distant reading and analysis for researchers (and the general public) interested in investigating cultural heritage domains. Therefore, in this study, we present a new end-to-end methodology for numerical aggregation QA for genealogical trees that includes (1) an automatic method for training dataset generation, (2) a transformer-based table selection method, and (3) an optimized transformer-based numerical aggregation QA model. The findings indicate that the proposed architecture, GLOBE, outperforms the state-of-the-art models and pipelines by achieving 87% accuracy for this task compared to only 21% by current state-of-the-art models. This study may have practical implications for genealogical information centers and museums, making genealogical data research easy and scalable for experts as well as the general public. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Abstract: The paper considers an approach to a knowledge graph construction based on the ontological representation of scientific subject areas. The presentation is based on concepts related to information and data mining, such as knowledge, knowledge extraction, domain ontology, scientific domain, thesaurus, semantic digital library, user information need, ontological design method and, in fact, the knowledge graph. The digital semantic library LibMeta is presented as a repository of various structured data with the possibility of their integration with other data sources. Assumes the possibility of specifying personal content by describing a local subject area within LibMeta. The ontology of the content of the semantic library acts as a means of formalization. This paper addresses the experience of building semantic libraries based on thesauri and ontological design. Building ontologies based on the thesaurus of the subject area LibMeta allows us to say that the presence of internal semantic links ensures the consistency and reliability of search results, which is a necessary condition for extracting scientific knowledge. The digital library ontology defines the data structure of the library content. Each data element loaded into the library can be associated with an ontology vertex (top) that determines the position of the data element in the ontology. Based on the ontology links and the links defined at the design stage, you can build a data graph. On the example of the ontology of the LibMeta semantic library, the technology of forming the knowledge graph of modern applications in mathematics is discussed. The problems of filling a graph, embedding in a graph, extracting links and nodes of a graph are discussed. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - iWareBatik is two digital tools (a website and a mobile app) designed and developed to communicate the value of Indonesian Batik, a UNESCO intangible cultural heritage in 2009. Such tools have been evaluated through a panel of 997 bachelor students recruited in 33 Indonesian universities. They have been involved in a process that encompassed user testing activities, filling in a survey related to them, participating in a focus group, and writing a short essay. 156 of them later on took part in hackathon type of competition, aimed at suggesting possible improvements to the iWareBatik set of tools. This paper outlines the overall design of the evaluation activities, and presents in detail the results of the user testing and the related survey, highlighting positive elements and dimensions to be improved. Such evaluation exercise is not only for the set of digital tools at stake, but can provide a relevant model for all those projects aiming at using digital media in the field of intangible cultural heritage, helping to fill-in the gap between design, development, and evaluation. © 2023, IGI Global.

AB  - Historic cemeteries face ravages of time, weather, and vandalism. We first captured hundreds of images for each of several unindexed historic cemeteries. We then used a high performance computing system to orthorectify these images into ultraresolution (billions of pixels), georeferenced, tiled images. Here, we describe the interactive visualization we developed using these tiled images to enable volunteers to collaboratively map graves and identify burials. Our ongoing work tests the capacity of this visualization to enable coordination between volunteers with distinct and often asynchronous assignments, including photography, mapping, research, and restoration.  © 2023 ACM.

AB  - Within any scientific disciplines, a large amount of data are buried within various literature depositories and archives, making it difficult to manually extract useful information from the datum swamps. The machine-learning extraction of data therefore is necessary for the big-data-based studies. Here, we develop a new text-mining technique to reconstruct the global database of the Precambrian to Recent stromatolites, providing better understanding of secular changes of stromatolites though geological time. The step-by-step data extraction process is described as below. First, the PDF documents of stromatolite-containing literatures were collected, and converted into text formation. Second, a glossary and tag-labeling system using NLP (Natural Language Processing) software was employed to search for all possible candidate pairs from each sentence within the papers collected here. Third, each candidate pair and features were represented as a factor graph model using a series of heuristic procedures to score the weights of each pair feature. Occurrence data of stromatolites versus stratigraphical units (abbreviated as Strata), facies types, locations, and age worldwide were extracted from literatures, respectively, and their extraction accuracies are 92%/464, 87%/778, 92%/846, and 93%/405 from 3 750 scientific abstracts, respectively, and are 90%/1 734, 86%/2 869, 90%/2 055 and 91%/857 from 11 932 papers, respectively. A total of 10 072 unique datum items were identified. The newly obtained stromatolite dataset demonstrates that their stratigraphical occurrences reached a pronounced peak during the Proterozoic (2 500–541 Ma), followed by a distinct fall during the Early Phanerozoic, and overall fluctuations through the Phanerozoic (541–0 Ma). Globally, seven stromatolite hotspots were identified from the new dataset, including western United States, eastern United States, western Europe, India, South Africa, northern China, and southern China. The proportional occurrences of inland aquatic stromatolites remain rather low (∼ 20%) in comparison to marine stromatolites from the Precambrian to Jurassic, and then display a significant increase (30%–70%) from the Cretaceous to the present. © 2023, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, Part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The aim of this article is to present and study how a digital archive can shape and create new ways of producing, publishing, and studying historical sources. Based on our analysis of the COURAGE (Cultural Opposition—Understanding the CultuRal HeritAGE of Dissent in the Former Socialist Countries) Registry about cultural dissent under state socialism in Eastern Europe in the second half of the twentieth century (and focusing on collections about environmental issues in this registry), we seek to understand how different private, amateur, and professional archivists have shaped the scientific and public legacy of cultural dissent under state socialism. The COURAGE Registry conveys a unique view of the history of the Soviet Bloc, providing an assemblage of documents concerning people, groups, institutions, events, and pieces from the time. Together, they tell an alternative story of cultural opposition under socialism, shedding light on important—but until now marginalized—problems, topics, and actors. Our results have shown that cultural opposition in the Registry is understood and constructed as a wide range of forms of engagement and activities, and it is not limited to specific high-cultural or direct political products. The structure of the COURAGE Registry creates a balance among collections that are very diverse in form, and its linked data structure helps connect the information and stories compiled in it. The COURAGE Registry enables researchers to use it as a tool with which to build their own scientific narratives about dissent under socialism. © 2022 Sage Publications.

AB  - Digital preservation will never be a solved problem: it needs constant reinvention, and is going to become harder over time. Scholarship is changing and this is affecting what needs to be preserved and what preservation means to the future of knowledge discovery. The diversification of outputs means that knowledge exists in a network of contextual metadata, data, software, standards and publications—requiring multilateral management of this complex knowledge graph. Preservation demands new skills, technologies and resources from librarians, publishers, funders and institutions—and more joined-up thinking about archiving. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose: This study analyzed the interdisciplinary characteristics of Chinese research studies in library and information science (LIS) measured by knowledge elements extracted through the Lexicon-LSTM model. Design/methodology/approach: Eight research themes were selected for experiment, with a large-scale (N = 11,625) dataset of research papers from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database constructed. And it is complemented with multiple corpora. Knowledge elements were extracted through a Lexicon-LSTM model. A subject knowledge graph is constructed to support the searching and classification of knowledge elements. An interdisciplinary-weighted average citation index space was constructed for measuring the interdisciplinary characteristics and contributions based on knowledge elements. Findings: The empirical research shows that the Lexicon-LSTM model has superiority in the accuracy of extracting knowledge elements. In the field of LIS, the interdisciplinary diversity indicator showed an upward trend from 2011 to 2021, while the disciplinary balance and difference indicators showed a downward trend. The knowledge elements of theory and methodology could be used to detect and measure the interdisciplinary characteristics and contributions. Originality/value: The extraction of knowledge elements facilitates the discovery of semantic information embedded in academic papers. The knowledge elements were proved feasible for measuring the interdisciplinary characteristics and exploring the changes in the time sequence, which helps for overview the state of the arts and future development trend of the interdisciplinary of research theme in LIS. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - LINKS stands for 'LINKing System for historical family reconstruction' and is a software system to link nominal data from the Dutch archives and ultimately reconstruct historical individuals and families. We present the background and philosophy of this matching system and explain its data structure and functioning. Currently the core data of the LINKS system consists of indexed civil certificates. These certificates are available from 1812 — the start of the Dutch Vital Registration — until the year they are confidential based on privacy laws. For more than 20 years, thousands of volunteers have been working to build this index, which contains not only the names of newborn, married and deceased persons, but also the names of their parents, places of birth, ages and sometimes their occupational titles. The software system LINKS includes the standardization of all input before linking, nominal record linkage procedures and identification of all unique persons involved in the system. All processes are repeatable and a strict distinction is maintained between source data, standardized, linked and enriched data and released data. Moreover, LINKS also informs archives about all kinds of errors and inconsistencies found during the cleaning and matching process. We will discuss two matching systems, the first is the original querying system that runs within a MySQL database environment and the second is a newly developed system, called burgerLinker, which is based on knowledge graphs and which is designed as a system that can be used independently from LINKS and is made available as open source software. Finally, we present the most important releases of LINKS data so far: two national releases that link birth and parental marriage certificates, creating families and pedigrees and an integrated dataset of persons, families and family trees in four provinces. © 2023, Mandemakers, Bloothooft, Laan, Raad, Mourits, Zijdeman.

AB  - The cultural world offers a staggering amount of rich and varied metadata on cultural heritage, accumulated by governmental, academic, and commercial players. However, the variety of involved institutions means that the data are stored in as many complex and often incompatible models and standards, which limits its availability and explorability by the greater public. The adoption of Linked Open Data technologies allows a strong interlinking of these various databases as well as external connections with existing knowledge bases. However, as they often contain references to the same entities, the delicate issue of entity alignment becomes the central challenge, especially in the absence or scarcity of unique global identifiers. To tackle this issue, we explored two approaches, one based on a set of heuristic rules and one based on masked language models, or masked language models (MLMs). We compare these two approaches, as well as different variations of MLMs, including some models trained on a different language, and various levels of data cleaning and labeling. Our results show that heuristics are a solid approach but also that MLM-based entity alignment obtains better performance coupled with the fact that it is robust to the data format and does not require any form of data preprocessing, which was not the case of the heuristic approach in our experiments. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a promising tool in healthcare applications. However, the reproducibility of many studies in this field is limited by the lack of accessible code implementations and standard benchmarks. To address the issue, we create PyHealth, a comprehensive library to build, deploy, and validate DL pipelines for healthcare applications. PyHealth supports various data modalities, including electronic health records (EHRs), physiological signals, medical images, and clinical text. It offers various advanced DL models and maintains comprehensive medical knowledge systems. The library is designed to support both DL researchers and clinical data scientists. Upon the time of writing, PyHealth has received 633 stars, 130 forks, and 15k+ downloads in total on GitHub. This tutorial will provide an overview of PyHealth, present different modules, and showcase their functionality through hands-on demos. Participants can follow along and gain hands-on experience on the Google Colab platform during the session.  © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - The popularity of Mobile has led to the rapid development of mobile learning. Especially for applications in Intangible Cultural Heritage education, many mobile learning systems have been produced. However, few systems have been evaluated for usability. In this paper, we evaluated the Intangible Cultural Heritage Based Augmented Reality Mobile Learning Application developed, using heuristic evaluation conducted by five evaluators to examine 10 heuristics. The results show that the minimalist design is more accessible for users. Finally, we have the system for our users' testing. They all think that this system can increase their knowledge of Intangible Cultural Heritage.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - In order to improve the ability of knowledge expression, management and mining in CAM numerial control programming field, a method to construct CAM numerial control programming knowledge graph was proposed. The information expression form of CAM numerial control programming stage was analyzed and the CAM information model was constructed. The ontology construction mode from concept to relation and from part to whole was adopted and semantic rules were introduced to realize the construction of knowledge graph pattern layer. Taking the historical CAM programming case base of a marine diesel engine enterprise as the data source, the feature-operation information unit model library was constructed, and the knowledge graph data layer was constructed by ontology mapping. By means of knowledge fusion and knowledge reasoning, the scale and quality of knowledge were enlarged and improved. Finally, a CAM knowledge graph Web platform was developed to verify the effectiveness of this method. © 2023 China Mechanical Engineering Magazine Office. All rights reserved.

AB  - Leveraging digital technologies, museums now have the opportunity to embrace innovative approaches such as knowledge graphs, virtual reality, and virtual assistants to enhance the preservation and interactive presentation of cultural information. However, despite these advancements, personalizing the museum experience remains a significant challenge. Thus, this paper aims to investigate the necessary elements for offering personalized access to cultural heritage within a VR exhibition. To accomplish this, a user study was conducted to identify user preferences for tailored content descriptions, track user viewing behavior to gauge their interest in a VR exhibition, and determine preferred methods of information gathering. The study involved 31 participants, and the findings are expected to provide valuable insights for designing effective and engaging VR exhibitions that cater to diverse visitor interests.  © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - With the rise in initiatives such as software ecosystems and Internet of Things (IoT), developing robust web Application Programming Interfaces (web APIs) has become an increasingly important practice. One main concern in developing web APIs is that they expose back-end systems and data toward clients. This exposure threatens critical non-functional requirements, such as the security of back-end systems, the performance of provided services, and the privacy of communications with clients. Although dealing with non-functional requirements during software design has been long studied, there is still little guide on addressing these requirements in web APIs. In this paper, we present WEBAPIK, a body of structured knowledge on addressing non-functional requirements in the design of web APIs. WEBAPIK is comprised of 27 distinct non-functional requirements, 37 distinct design techniques to address some of the identified requirements, and the trade-offs of 22 design techniques, presented in two forms of natural language and knowledge graphs. The design knowledge compiled in WEBAPIK is systematically extracted and aggregated from 80 heterogeneous online literature resources, including 7 books, 15 weblogs and tutorial, 5 vendor white papers, 6 design standards, and 47 research papers. These resources are systematically retrieved from two search engines of Google and Google Scholar and five research databases of Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, SpringerLink, and ScienceDirect in two periods of March to August 2018 and August 2022. WEBAPIK gathers and structures expert and scholarly discussions to provide insight about addressing non-functional requirements in the design of web APIs. The structure brought to the design knowledge makes it amenable towards extension and creates the potential for employing it in the database of knowledge-based systems that aid software developers in design decision-making. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and cervical spinal cord is often performed in diagnostic evaluation of suspected motor neuron disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MND/ALS). Analysis of MRI-derived tissue damage metrics in a common domain facilitates group-level inferences on pathophysiology. This approach was applied to address competing hypotheses of directionality of neurodegeneration, whether anterograde, cranio-caudal dying-forward from precentral gyrus or retrograde, dying-back. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, MRI was performed on 75 MND patients and 13 healthy controls. Precentral gyral thickness was estimated from volumetric T1-weighted images using FreeSurfer, corticospinal tract fractional anisotropy (FA) from diffusion tensor imaging using FSL, and cross-sectional cervical cord area between C1-C8 levels using Spinal Cord Toolbox. To analyse these multimodal data within a common domain, individual parameter estimates representing tissue damage at each corticospinal tract level were first converted to z-scores, referenced to healthy control norms. Mixed-effects linear regression models were then fitted to these z-scores, with gradients hypothesised to represent directionality of neurodegeneration. Results: At group-level, z-scores did not differ significantly between precentral gyral and intracranial corticospinal tract tissue damage estimates (regression coefficient − 0.24, [95% CI − 0.62, 0.14], p = 0.222), but step-changes were evident between intracranial corticospinal tract and C1 (1.14, [95% CI 0.74, 1.53], p < 0.001), and between C5 and C6 cord levels (0.98, [95% CI 0.58, 1.38], p < 0.001). Discussion: Analysis of brain and cervical spinal MRI data in a common domain enabled investigation of pathophysiological hypotheses in vivo. A cranio-caudal step-change in MND patients was observed, and requires further investigation in larger cohorts. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - In view of the decisive role played by knowledge ontologies and their linked data in knowledge organization, an effective initiative involving both is necessary for research on stele inscriptions. The absence of this will not only hinder the acquisition of stele inscription knowledge but also affect the further exploration of its value. In response to the research demand of scholars in the field of stele inscriptions, a knowledge organization initiative designed for the digital resources of ancient Chinese stele inscriptions is developed in this paper. The adoption of a bottom-up method makes it possible to abstract the knowledge ontology model from the existing mature metadata of stele inscriptions, improving the quality of the ontology itself as well as guaranteeing its compatibility with the existing digital resources of stele inscriptions. On this basis, this paper deals with the process and key steps involved in the knowledge organization of stele inscriptions and the construction of linked data. The knowledge organization initiative discussed in this paper will serve as dedicated support for digital academic research in the field of stele inscriptions and will provide a valuable reference for the design of a knowledge organization initiative in the field of cultural heritage in China and beyond. © 2024 The Board of Trustees, University of Illinois.

AB  - MORDigital project aims to encode the selected editions of Diccionario de Lingua Portugueza by António de Morais Silva, first published in 1789. Our ultimate goals are, on the one hand, to promote accessibility to cultural heritage while fostering reusability and, on the other hand, to contribute towards a more significant presence of lexicographic digital content in Portuguese through open tools and standards. The Morais dictionary represents a significant legacy, since it marks the beginning of Portuguese dictionaries, having served as a model for all subsequent lexicographic production. The team follows a new paradigm in lexicography, which results from the convergence between lexicography, terminology, computational linguistics, and ontologies as an integral part of digital humanities and linked (open) data. In the Portuguese context, this research fills a gap concerning searchable online retrodigitized dictionaries, built on current standards and methodologies which promote data sharing and harmonization, namely TEI Lex-0. The team will further ensure the connection to other existing systems and lexical resources, particularly in the Portuguese-speaking world.  © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have proven to be a reliable way of structuring data. They can provide a rich source of contextual information about cultural heritage collections. However, cultural heritage KGs are far from being complete. They are often missing important attributes such as geographical location, especially for sculptures and mobile or indoor entities such as paintings. In this paper, we first present a framework for ingesting knowledge about tangible cultural heritage entities from various data sources and their connected multi-hop knowledge into a geolocalized KG. Secondly, we propose a multi-view learning model for estimating the relative distance between a given pair of cultural heritage entities, based on the geographical as well as the knowledge connections of the entities. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Data analytical pipelines routinely involve various domain-specific data science models. Such models require expensive manual or training effort and often incur expensive validation costs (e.g., via scientific simulation analysis). Meanwhile, high-value models remain to be ad-hocly created, isolated, and underutilized for a broad community. Searching and accessing proper models for data analysis pipelines is desirable yet challenging for users without domain knowledge. This paper introduces ModsNet, a novel MODel SelectioN framework that only requires an Example daTaset. (1) We investigate the following problem: Given a library of pre-trained models, a limited amount of historical observations of their performance, and an “example” dataset as a query, return k models that are expected to perform the best over the query dataset. (2) We formulate a regression problem and introduce a knowledge-enhanced framework using a model-data interaction graph. Unlike traditional methods, (1) ModsNet uses a dynamic, cost-bounded “probe-and-select” strategy to incrementally identify promising pre-trained models in a strict cold-start scenario (when a new dataset without any interaction with existing models is given). (2) To reduce the learning cost, we develop a clustering-based sparsification strategy to prune unpromising models and their interactions. (3) We showcase ModsNet built on top of a crowdsourced materials knowledge base platform. Our experiments verified its effectiveness, efficiency, and applications over real-world analytical pipelines. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.

AB  - Historical architectural archives enjoy attention from diverse audiences, acting as a primary source of information for architects, historians, public authorities, and common citizens alike. In Italy, the interest in architectural archives has grown slowly but steadily for the last 20 years. However, architectural archives do not generally follow the trend common for museums and galleries in publishing digitized materials and providing standard metadata for individual records. The information that is available online usually includes only an archival finding aid, instead of metadata about the individual records, or fully digital versions of the records. While cataloguing standards for archival descriptions of architectural records have existed at least since the 1980s, the rise of Linked Open Data as a framework for publishing cultural heritage data has allowed archivists to enhance these archival descriptions with richer contextual information and links to external knowledge bases. In this paper we present the ITDT ontology, an extension of the Records in Contexts Ontology that facilitates the representation of architectural records and of the context related to architectural projects, its process, and participating entities. We discuss the application of the ontology to the project files of Italian architect and engineer Dino Tamburini (1924–2011), and the creation of a digital archive offering multiple perspectives over the records. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - With the continuous development of information technology, people’s requirements for book retrieval are becoming higher and higher. How to fully utilize a large amount of information, effectively mine out potentially valuable information, and improve the efficiency and quality of library retrieval is currently a major research hotspot. This article conducts research from the following aspects. One is to establish a knowledge graph for book users, with the aim of enhancing the correlation between users’ search keywords and book information matching in the massive amount of search information, which is divided into three stages: knowledge extraction, knowledge fusion and knowledge processing; The second is to build the user profile, with the aim of exploring users’ interests and preferences, including the basic user information (such as username, gender, age, occupation, location and so on), user log data (such as user browsing records, search records, borrowing records, etc.); The third is to establish the association of the knowledge graph and user profiles for book recommendation to improve the efficiency of library retrieval. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - While research on semantic wikis is declining, Semantic MediaWiki (SMW) can still play an important role in the emerging field of knowledge graph curation. The Vienna History Wiki, a large knowledge base curated by the city government in collaboration with other institutions and the general public, provides an ideal use case for demonstrating strengths and weaknesses of SMW as well as discussing the challenges of co-curation in a cultural heritage setting. This paper describes processes like collaborative editing, interlinking unique identifiers on the web, sharing data with Wikidata, making use of Schema.org, and other ontologies. It presents insights from a user survey, access statistics, and a knowledge graph analysis. This work contributes to the scarce research in wiki usage outside of the Wikipedia ecosystem as well as to the field of community-based knowledge graph curation. The availability of a now significantly improved RDF representation indicates future directions for research and practice. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - In order to improve the knowledge service ability of the library and meet the user's demand for querying Chinese technology literature in natural language. This article proposes a two-stage method to implement the question answering system for Chinese technology literature. In the first stage, the Chinese question classification system based on sentence pattern is designed, and the stacking framework of ensemble learning algorithm is used to classify Chinese question. In the second stage, the pipeline is employed to parse the natural language question sentences and transfer them into Cypher statement. The field of "competitive intelligence"is selected for experiment. The experimental results show that the proposed stacking classification model improves the metric F1 by 10.81% compared with the single model average. Overall, the accuracy of translating Chinese questions into Cypher statements reached 83.96%. The proposed method can effectively convert Chinese questions into Cypher statements and directly return the answer to users. It provides a reference scheme for the application of the question answering based on knowledge map, which can improve the knowledge service ability of the library.  © 2023 ACM.

AB  - As more and more knowledge graphs (KGs) are published on the Web, there is a need for tools that show their content. This implies showing the schema-level patterns instantiated in the graph, but also the terms used to qualify its entities. In this article, we present a new profiling tool that we call TTprofiler. It shows the predicates that relate types in the KG, and also the terms present in this KG, because of their paramount importance in most KGs, especially in the Cultural Heritage (CH) domain. We recall the role of terminologies and how they are implemented and used on the Web, we give the algorithm for building a TT profile from an online KG's endpoint, and we report on experiments performed over a set of Cultural Heritage Web KGs. A tool for visualizing TT profiles is also provided. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.

AB  - For the current museum small-scale knowledge map of historical relics needs to be constructed manually, this paper will introduce the relevant methods of deep learning to construct the knowledge map of historical relics, and conducts an in-depth study and analysis of the entity recognition model and algorithm in the construction of the knowledge map of relics, and improves the accuracy of model detection by improving and optimizing the model. In the process of entity recognition in this paper, the bi-directional long and short-term memory-conditional random field (Bi LSTM-CRF) and convolutional neural network (CNN) are combined to construct a network model for extracting entity information. In the comparison experiments, its data source is a self-built dataset based on historical artifact datasets. The experimental results show that the improved Bi LSTM-CNN-CRF model has a better entity recognition effect compared with the CRF, Bi LSTM, and Bi LSTM-CRF models, and it achieves an accuracy rate of up to 85.77% and an F-value of 84.49%.  © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Abstract: An ontological approach to the construction of a thesaurus of the applied subject area of a scientific academic journal based on the content of the LibMeta semantic digital library and subject area sources is considered. A thesaurus and a knowledge graph of the subject area of scientific publications of the journal of the Russian Academy of Sciences Mechanics of Composite Materials and Structures, devoted to the modeling of composite materials and structures, is being built. The approach is based on the use of the content of the semantic library LibMeta, classical primary sources on the theory of elasticity and metadata of the journal articles. As a result, a thesaurus and a knowledge graph of the subject area of the journal are built, and on their basis the user interface is modified and a variant of navigation through the links of articles is proposed. Examples of constructions are given. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - Using database technology and AI, it is of great significance to explore the database case for data processing and analysis of the digital transformation platform based on Knowledge graphe. Knowledge graph includes knowledge engineering, natural language processing, database, machine learning. With the development of university-enterprise cooperation in china, high-quality resources in the computer industry will be introduced into the practice of database courses, so as to create new database practice case library with new engineering characteristics. Colleges and universities have realized the training goal of talent technology under the background of new engineering by building a hierarchical database oriented talent training mode. Knowledge graph is used to process massive multi-dimensional data, which can be considered as a semantic network. The knowledge graph processing steps involve knowledge representation, knowledge acquisition, knowledge fusion, knowledge calculation and knowledge reasoning. The knowledge graph includes the processing and calculation of database data. Then, the construction of the case of the database can use the knowledge graph technology. The construction and reform of the database practice case for the new engineering and engineering education accreditation, and the strengthening of both theory and practice, have an obvious role and significance in improving the quality of talent training in the computer direction, promoting practical teaching and improving teaching quality. Based on the innovative mode of university-enterprise cooperation, this paper explores the path and direction of the construction of the case library for practical of database using knowledge graph.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Industrial information models are standardised ways of representing industrial devices, equipment, and processes together with the data collected from associated sensors and control systems. Companies invest in such models to enable digitalisation and modular, reusable solutions. They also invest heavily in analytics (e.g. machine learning) based on time series data sets to improve operations. Queries that use such context to retrieve time series data can make industrial data sets more accessible to practitioners performing analytics and application development. Moreover, they can enable scalable deployment of resulting analytical models. Industrial availability constraints require that queries over context and time series should be portable in general, as they should be able retrieve data for training in a cloud setting and production data for deployment in an on-premise setting. Solving this problem is challenging with existing approaches as context and time series data tend to exist in separate, specialised databases. We address the issue by proposing a hybrid query engine, namely Chrontext, in the setting of a SPARQL database hosting the static model, and an arbitrary time series database. We show how with a set of annotations in the knowledge graph, SPARQL queries can be evaluated over such a hybrid architecture. We provide a proof showing that our approach correctly answers SPARQL 1.1. queries. We implement our approach in Rust under the Apache 2.0 license, and use the Apache Arrow-based Polars library together with configurable pushdowns to achieve high performance. We compare the performance of Chrontext against Ontop, one of the most prominent virtual knowledge graph systems, on a synthetic data set based on industrial standards. Data are stored in a S3 data lake and PostgreSQL with the Dremio data lakehouse as the SQL integrator. We find that our approach performs 10× to 85× faster and consumes much less memory than Ontop. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - The rapid development of information technology has made the amount of information in massive texts far exceed human intuitive cognition, and dependency parsing can effectively deal with information overload. In the background of domain specialization, the migration and application of syntactic treebanks and the speed improvement in syntactic analysis models become the key to the efficiency of syntactic analysis. To realize domain migration of syntactic tree library and improve the speed of text parsing, this paper proposes a novel approach—the Double-Array Trie and Multi-threading (DAT-MT) accelerated graph fusion dependency parsing model. It effectively combines the specialized syntactic features from small-scale professional field corpus with the generalized syntactic features from large-scale news corpus, which improves the accuracy of syntactic relation recognition. Aiming at the problem of high space and time complexity brought by the graph fusion model, the DAT-MT method is proposed. It realizes the rapid mapping of massive Chinese character features to the model’s prior parameters and the parallel processing of calculation, thereby improving the parsing speed. The experimental results show that the unlabeled attachment score (UAS) and the labeled attachment score (LAS) of the model are improved by 13.34% and 14.82% compared with the model with only the professional field corpus and improved by 3.14% and 3.40% compared with the model only with news corpus; both indicators are better than DDParser and LTP 4 methods based on deep learning. Additionally, the method in this paper achieves a speedup of about 3.7 times compared to the method with a red-black tree index and a single thread. Efficient and accurate syntactic analysis methods will benefit the real-time processing of massive texts in professional fields, such as multi-dimensional semantic correlation, professional feature extraction, and domain knowledge graph construction. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Digital tools, technologies, and infrastructures have increasingly shaped how knowledge is understood, created, managed, maintained, and shared. In sectors such as cultural heritage, for example, curators and scholars now widely apply computer science approaches to their collections for tasks such as enriching content and providing users with visual access. Although there has been an increasing interest in critical digital visual design and cultural heritage, what still seems to be largely missing is a problematised and critical approach to the application of these techniques. Drawing on critical posthumanities, in this article I propose a new critical framework, the post-authentic framework to digital objects and cultural heritage. The framework advocates transparency and openness as well as the active and reflexive participation of the scholar/curator in the process of knowledge production. To exemplify how the post-authentic framework may be applied to digital research, I explore two use cases: critical visualisation design and critical digital heritage research. For the first use case, I examine the design choices for developing the tool DeXTER, an interactive visualisation app that allows users to explore enriched cultural heritage material interactively. I specifically emphasise the challenges facing product design, with a focus on visualising the ambiguities and uncertainties of Network Analysis and Sentiment Analysis. For the second use case, I explore the potential of DeXTER for testing hypotheses on large textual collections, for example by accessing the layers of meaning attached to referential entities. The use case is the Italian American labour movement from 1898 to 1936. The article concludes with key concepts and methods for applying the post-authentic framework to digital heritage practices and knowledge creation more widely.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Aim of my research is to exploit Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) as base for advanced Cultural Heritage (CH) fruition by means of Automatic Story Generation (ASG). Following the rationale that discovering and reviving already existing (yet latent) narratives is worthier than automatically generating them from anew in eliciting the user's interest, the input-2-graph and the graph-2-sequence ASG-pipeline phases, heavily relying on LLOD, will be given a deeper focus, whereby the final Natural Language Generation (NLG) module will be constrained by the entities and relations established in the Knowledge Graph (KG) generation modules (a configuration typical of the neurosymbolic approach). In order to enhance possibilities of implementation in real-life contexts, the elaborated pipeline will be modular, i.e. self-sufficient in its constituent parts. Beyond the countless possible application scenarios ranging from education to entertainment, this solution detangles the user from his role of mere consumer, and empowers him not only to control the creation process [3.1], but also to find already within it, and not necessarily in the final outcome, a valuable source for intellectual growth. This work intends the addressing of a specific societal need as an avalanche to simultaneously fill knowledge gaps identified in and among the related scientific domains. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The advancement of digital technologies promotes the documentation of traditional operas, leaving a large amount of data but in a state of fragmentation. Constructing a knowledge graph (KG) is an effective way to realize the knowledge integration and reduce fragmentation, which can help the public understand traditional operas. However, constructed KGs in cultural heritage are mainly unimodal, lacking the ability to give the public a comprehensive perception, especially when they do not have related in-depth knowledge. In this paper, we take Chinese nation-level traditional operas as an example and construct a traditional opera ontology OpeOnto including classes with deep semantics (topic, sentiment). Then, we adopt an OpeOnto-driven way to construct multimodal knowledge graph OpeMKG including images and music links from several data resources. Aimed at analysing sentiments in OpeMKG and the automatic genre recognition of works for the preparation of automatic updating of OpeMKG, we develop a novel unified sentiment and genre recognition model (SGRM) for traditional operas with multimodal fusion and multi-task learning (MTL). The proposed model is examined on the built dataset of traditional operas and experimental results demonstrate its superiority compared with several state-of-the-art baselines. © 2023 Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR)

AB  - The use of digital models of cultural heritage objects obtained from 3D scanning or photogrammetry requires the development of strategies in order to optimise computational resources and enhance the user experience when they are used in interactive applications or virtual museums. Through a case study, this work compares an original photogrammetric model with its optimised version using traditional remeshing techniques and an improved version using Nanite technology, developed by Epic Games. A self-contained executable is created in Unreal® 5.1 game engine to test the performance of the three models measured in frames per second (FPS). As a result, it was demonstrated that, although there is no substantial difference in the FPS rate, the Nanite technology avoids the need to perform the mesh and texture editing processes that lead to the construction of the optimised model. This saves considerable time and specialised effort, as the photogrammetric model can be converted to a Nanite object automatically. This would be a great advantage in the case of virtualisations of large collections of heritage objects, which is a common case in virtual museums. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The use of eXtended Reality (XR) technologies, including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR), has become increasingly popular in museums to enhance the visitor experience. However, the impact of XR technologies on Learning Performance in the context of archeological museums needs to be better understood. This study aims to investigate the relationships between Usability, Presence and Learning Performance by developing XR experiences showcasing archeological artefacts and conducting user testing to evaluate their effectiveness. A laboratory test is conducted to compare a VR application with a mobile AR one, presenting the digital models of five archeological findings. Descriptive statistics are used to compare the two case studies, providing valuable insights into the impact of XR technologies on the visitor experience from a learning perspective. The study confirms that Usability has a more significant effect on learning than Presence and can help designers and museum managers better understand the factors contributing to a successful XR experience. The findings suggest that while Presence is an important factor in improving visitors’ experience, Usability should be the priority when designing XR experiences for museums. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce LagunAR, a mobile outdoor Augmented Reality (AR) application for providing heritage information and 3D visualization on a city scale. The LagunAR application was developed to provide historical information about the city of La Laguna in the XVI century, when it was the main city in the Canary Islands. The application provides a reconstructed 3D model of the city at that time that is shown on a mobile phone over-imposed on the actual city using geolocation. The geolocated position is used also for providing information of several points of interest in the city. The paper describes the design and implementation of the application and details the optimization techniques that have been used to manage the full information of the city using a mobile phone as a sensor and visualization tool. We explain the application usability study carried out using a heuristic test; in addition it is probed by users in a qualitative user test developed as preliminary research. Results show that it is possible to develop a real-time application that shows the user a city-scale 3D model and also manages the information of the points of interest. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Many machine learning (ML) libraries are accessible online for ML practitioners. Typical ML pipelines are complex and consist of a series of steps, each of them invoking several ML libraries. In this demo paper, we present ExeKGLib, a Python library that allows users with coding skills and minimal ML knowledge to build ML pipelines. ExeKGLib relies on knowledge graphs to improve the transparency and reusability of the built ML workflows, and to ensure that they are executable. We demonstrate the usage of ExeKGLib and compare it with conventional ML code to show ExeKGLib ’s benefits. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG. 2023.

AB  - The last decade has seen a steady increase in the application of virtual 3D approaches in cultural heritage research. Although a large literature exists about the advantages of 3D methods in this field, here we go one step further and elucidate a) how image-based 3D reconstructions can be displayed in virtual reality (VR) space using freeware game engine software and low-cost VR hardware and b) highlight the relative benefits and advantages with a focus on interactive museum displays of relatively large archaeological objects. Specifically, we present three 3D models of different stone grave structures from the Neolithic necropolis of Lenzburg (Northern Switzerland, 4450-3500 BCE). The site has been excavated in 1959/60 and certain graves were subsequently preserved for museum display. By means of VR applications, it is now possible to experience these approximately 6000-year-old tombs with an innovative approach circumventing various barriers or constraints and offering interactive display options. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Cultural Heritage has become a considerable active area of application of linked data and semantic web technologies. Visualizing and exploring the linked data produced to enhance cultural heritage is one of the significant challenges in the research field of Digital Humanities. Therefore, in this survey, we describe systems developed by the semantic web community in the Web of Linked Data context. We compared twenty-eight interfaces that show both about generals that digital library contents. We classified them by interaction paradigm, type of information displayed and complexity reduction strategies used. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Quality patient care is a complex and multifaceted problem requiring the integration of data from multiple sources. We propose Medicient, a knowledge-graph-based question answering system that processes heterogeneous data sources, including patient health records, drug databases, and medical literature, into a unified knowledge graph with zero training. The knowledge graph is then utilized to provide personalized recommendations for treatment or medication. The system leverages the power of large language models for question understanding and natural language response generation, while hiding sensitive patient information. We compare our system to a large language model (ChatGPT), which does not have access to patient health records, and show that our system provides better recommendations. This study contributes to a growing body of research on knowledge graphs and their applications in healthcare. © 2023 ACM.

AB  - We present Meteor, a new inventory for European news sources (i.e. EU + UK, CH, NO, IL): https://wp3.opted.eu/. This inventory will facilitate researchers’ efforts to select sources across platforms and gather related textual data. It contains the names of print and online news sources, social media accounts, news blogs, and alternative news media sources, as well as rich meta-information for each entry (e.g. language, audience size, topical focus, ownership structures, access to full-text archives, secondary data, related research). Meteor accounts for the fuzziness of hybrid media systems through an interlinked knowledge graph. Entries are submitted by researchers, validated, continuously updated, and openly accessible to the public. Our inventory allows users to find various European news sources based on a wide range of criteria, putting scholars in a better position to navigate the European media landscape. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Identifying novel autophagy (ATG) associated genes in humans remains an important task for understanding this fundamental physiological process. Machine learning (ML) can highlight potentially “missing pieces” linking core ATG genes with understudied, “dark” genes by mining functional genomic data. Here, a set of 103 (out of 288 genes from the Autophagy Database) was used as training set, based on ATG-associated terms annotated from 3 secondary sources: GO (gene ontology), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway, and UniProt keywords, as additional confirmation of their importance in ATG. As negative labels, an OMIM list of genes associated with monogenic diseases was used (after excluding the 288 ATG-associated genes). Data related to these genes from 17 different sources were compiled and used to derive a trained MetaPath/XGBoost (MPxgb) ML model for distinguishing ATG and non-ATG genes (10-fold cross-validated, 100-times randomized models, median area under the curve = 0.994 ± 0.008). Sixteen ATG-relevant variables explained 64% of the total model gain. Overall, 23% of the top 251 predicted genes are annotated in the Autophagy Database, whereas 193 genes (77%) are not. In 2019, we suggested that some of these 193 genes may represent “ATG dark genes.” A literature search in 2022 for those top 20 predicted ATG dark genes found that 9 were subsequently reported as ATG genes during the intervening 3.5 years. A post-factum evaluation of data leakage (the presence of ATG-associated terms in the top 40 ML features) confirms that 7 out of these 9 genes and 2 out of 3 other recently validated predictions from the bottom 20 are novel. Those genes with the largest number of ATG features would be most likely to yield valuable experimental insights. Modern high-throughput testing would be capable of spanning the full 193 ATG genes list reported here. Our analysis demonstrates that ML can guide genomics research to gain a more complete functional and pathway annotation of complex processes. Key points: –A knowledge-graph based machine learning model was designed for predicting unknown autophagy genes via mining functional genomic data. –Literature search validated predicted genes. –Our machine learning models could be generalized and applied to other genomic libraries to uncover dark genes for various functions. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To explore the construction of the "homogeneity-difference-synergy" prescription review system in a public hospital with multiple districts, and to create a plat form that compatible with multipledistrictshomogeneousprescriplion audit and differentiated supervision. METHODS Combined with the information basic conditions of hospital and the characteristics of clinical diagnosis and treatment in each district, the construction idea of "homogeneity-difference-collaboration" prescription review system in a public hospital with multiple districts was put forward. With the construction of knowledge graph library, the formulation of homogenize review rules, the compatibility of differentiated supervision requirements, the coordinated implementation of closed-loop review function and the exploration of intelligent decision module, a review system based on synchronous linkage and personality compatibility under the framework of "a hospital with multiple districts" has been formed. RESULTS Half a year after the system went online, the level of rational drug use in all districts was improved, the average system bounce ratio decreased from initial 19. 35% to 11. 68%, and the rate of problem prescriptions submitted was reduced from 9. 14% to 4. 75%. Compared with before the system went online, the average prescription rationality rate was significantly improved (84. 23% vs. 95. 25%). CONCLUSION Considering the characteristics of the reform and reorganization of the public hospital, the establishment of the "homogeneity-difference-synergy" prescription review system in a public hospital with multiple districts lays a homogeneous technical foundation for the subsequent construction of "regional prescription review center", also provides experience for other large medical institutions to carry out similar work. © 2023 Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Hospital Pharmacy.

AB  - Smart education has changed teaching ways and methods. However, there is a lack of effective research on the relationship among different knowledge points. To address problems such as unclear relationship among different knowledge points, poor continuity of teaching process, rich but scattered teaching resources. Therefore, we propose to a curriculum knowledge point model through curriculum Knowledge Graph technology, analyzes and studies knowledge points from the perspective of curriculum, and uses the Python technology to grasp the key curriculum information. Then, this paper uses the Jieba Library in Python to complete Chinese word segmentation, extract key knowledge points and mine various associations between knowledge points. Finally, this paper completes the visualization of Knowledge Graph through Gephi. The results show that the effectiveness of this method is verified on two groups of data and lay a foundation for the further design of personalized teaching path, question and answer system, and student group portrait. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

AB  - The construction and effective application of an intangible cultural heritage knowledge graph (ICH KG) can realize the knowledge integration, and optimize the ICH knowledge management. However, high complexity and low computational efficiency of ICH KG make its application face challenges. We propose a multi-source knowledge graph embedding (KGE) model named ICHMKGE to convert the ICH KG into the vector representations to improve the computational efficiency of ICH KG and promote the digital sustainable development of ICH. Firstly, we take the Chinese ICH project 24 solar terms as an example and combine multiple official data sources to construct the Chinese ICH KG as a basis for this study. Secondly, as the ICH project is being further explored with the limited coverage of ICH knowledge, entity sparsity poses a serious challenge for ICH KGE. This paper employs the BERT model to encode the complete description information of entities, and establishes connection between triples entities and ontology concepts via cross-view modeling. Finally, the proposed ICHMKGE model is compared with the baseline models, and the experimental results demonstrate that the model exhibits superiority. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a trend towards synergies among cultural heritage institutions, such as GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives & Museums) collaborations in the field of information resource management. These institutions have been actively promoting the construction of digital humanities projects. Such projects primarily target data resource construction and digital humanities services, which are in line with the service functions of GLAM institutions. With the development of networking and digitisation, museums have been making more prominent contributions to knowledge sharing and dissemination.Digital technology has brought about profound changes in the academic research environment. The expansion of traditional research and the emergence of new questions in the digital environment have promoted novel perspectives, thinking, and methods. With the increase in digitisation of cultural heritage, the scale of data has grown rapidly, and the types of data available have been continuously enriched, from knowledge aggregation to knowledge organization and even knowledge transmission. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the tools of digital humanities, which constitute an important means of knowledge production, and to work with traditional GLAM institutions to promote digital thinking and interdisciplinary knowledge integration methods. At the technical level, methods such as knowledge graphs and ontologies are used to construct a multi-layered and systematic knowledge system. This paper presents a review focused on three cultural heritage models, CIDOC CRM, Europeana and the Sampo Model, and reflects on three aspects of the current models: Technical framework construction, digital resources, and service systems. © 2023 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

AB  - Archives are facing numerous challenges. On the one hand, archival assets are evolving to encompass digitized documents and increasing quantities of born-digital information in diverse formats. On the other hand, the audience is changing along with how it wishes to access archival material. Moreover, the interoperability requirements of cultural heritage repositories are growing. In this context, the Portuguese Archives started an ambitious program aiming to evolve its data model, migrate existing records, and build a new archival management system appropriate to both archival tasks and public access. The overall goal is to have a fine-grained and flexible description, more machine-actionable than the current one. This work describes ArchOnto, a linked open data model for archives, and rules for its automatic population from existing records. ArchOnto adopts a semantic web approach and encompasses the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model and additional ontologies, envisioning interoperability with datasets curated by multiple communities of practice. Existing ISAD(G)-conforming descriptions are being migrated to the new model using the direct mappings provided here. We used a sample of 25 records associated with different description levels to validate the completeness and conformity of ArchOnto to existing data. This work is in progress and is original in several respects: (1) it is one of the first approaches to use CIDOC CRM in the context of archives, identifying problems and questions that emerged during the process and pinpointing possible solutions; (2) it addresses the balance in the model between the migration of existing records and the construction of new ones by archive professionals; and (3) it adopts an open world view on linking archival data to global information sources. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - In this work, we introduce ICON, an ontology that models artistic interpretations of artworks' subject matter (i.e., iconographies) and meanings (i.e., symbols, iconological aspects). Developed by conceptualizing authoritative knowledge and notions taken from Panofsky's levels of interpretation theory, ICON ontology focuses on the granularity of interpretations. It can be used to describe an interpretation of an artwork from the pre-iconographical, icongraphical, and iconological levels. Its main classes have been aligned to ontologies that come from the domains of cultural descriptions (ArCo, CIDOC-CRM, VIR), semiotics (DOLCE), bibliometrics (CITO), and symbolism (Simulation Ontology), to grant a robust schema that can be extendable using additional classes and properties coming from these ontologies. The ontology was evaluated through competency questions that range from simple recognition on a specific level of interpretation to complex scenarios. Data written using this model was compared to state-of-the-art ontologies and schemas to both highlight the current lack of a domain-specific ontology on art interpretation and show how our work fills some of the current gaps. The ontology is openly available and compliant with FAIR principles. With our ontology, we hope to encourage digital art historians working for cultural institutions in making more detailed linked open data about the content of their artifacts, to exploit the full potential of Semantic Web in linking artworks through not only subjects and common metadata but also specific symbolic interpretations, intrinsic meanings, and the motifs through which their subjects are represented. Additionally, by basing our work on theories made by different art history scholars in the last century, we make sure that their knowledge and studies will not be lost in the transition to the digital, linked open data era. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Gene and protein set enrichment analysis is a critical step in the analysis of data collected from omics experiments. Enrichr is a popular gene set enrichment analysis web-server search engine that contains hundreds of thousands of annotated gene sets. While Enrichr has been useful in providing enrichment analysis with many gene set libraries from different categories, integrating enrichment results across libraries and domains of knowledge can further hypothesis generation. To this end, Enrichr-KG is a knowledge graph database and a web-server application that combines selected gene set libraries from Enrichr for integrative enrichment analysis and visualization. The enrichment results are presented as subgraphs made of nodes and links that connect genes to their enriched terms. In addition, users of Enrichr-KG can add gene-gene links, as well as predicted genes to the subgraphs. This graphical representation of cross-library results with enriched and predicted genes can illuminate hidden associations between genes and annotated enriched terms from across datasets and resources. Enrichr-KG currently serves 26 gene set libraries from different categories that include transcription, pathways, ontologies, diseases/drugs, and cell types. To demonstrate the utility of Enrichr-KG we provide several case studies. Enrichr-KG is freely available at: https://maayanlab.cloud/enrichr-kg.  © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - AI applications often use ML/DL (Machine Learning/Deep Learning) models to implement specific AI tasks. As application developers usually are not AI experts, they often choose to integrate existing implementations of ML/DL models as libraries for their AI tasks. As an active research area, AI attracts many researchers and produces a lot of papers every year. Many of the papers propose ML/DL models for specific tasks and provide their implementations. However, it is not easy for developers to find ML/DL libraries that are suitable for their tasks. The challenges lie in not only the fast development of AI application domains and techniques, but also the lack of detailed information of the libraries such as environmental dependencies and supporting resources. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on ML/DL library seeking questions on Stack Overflow to understand the developers' requirements for ML/DL libraries. Based on the findings of the study, we propose a task-oriented ML/DL library recommendation approach, called MLTaskKG. It constructs a knowledge graph that captures AI tasks, ML/DL models, model implementations, repositories, and their relationships by extracting knowledge from different sources such as ML/DL resource websites, papers, ML/DL frameworks, and repositories. Based on the knowledge graph, MLTaskKG recommends ML/DL libraries for developers by matching their requirements on tasks, model characteristics, and implementation information. Our evaluation shows that 92.8% of the tuples sampled from the resulting knowledge graph are correct, demonstrating the high quality of the knowledge graph. A further experiment shows that MLTaskKG can help developers find suitable ML/DL libraries using 47.6% shorter time and with 68.4% higher satisfaction.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The cancer imaging archive (TICA) receives and manages an ever-increasing quantity of clinical (non-image) data containing valuable information about subjects in imaging collections. To harmonize and integrate these data, we have first cataloged the types of information occurring across public TCIA collections. We then produced mappings for these diverse instance data using ontology-based representation patterns and transformed the data into a knowledge graph in a semantic database. This repository combined the transformed instance data with relevant background knowledge from domain ontologies. The resulting repository of semantically integrated data is a rich source of information about subjects that can be queried across imaging collections. Building on this work we have implemented and deployed a REST API and a user-facing semantic cohort builder tool. This tool allows allow researchers and other users to search and identify groups of subject-level records based on non-image data that were not queryable prior to this work. The search results produced by this interface link to images, allowing users to quickly identify and view images matching the selection criteria, as well as allowing users to export the harmonized clinical data. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The recovery and resilience of the cultural and creative sectors after the COVID-19 pandemic is a current topic with priority for the European Commission. Cultural gems is a crowdsourced web platform managed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission aimed at creating community-led maps as well as a common repository for cultural and creative places across European cities and towns. More than 130,000 physical locations and online cultural activities in more than 300 European cities and towns are currently tracked by the application. The main objective of Cultural gems consists in raising a holistic vision of European culture, reinforcing a sense of belonging to a common European cultural space. This data article describes the ontology developed for Cultural gems, adopted to represent the domain of knowledge of the application by means of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles and following the paradigms of Linked Open Data (LOD). We provide an overview of this dataset, and describe the ontology model, along with the services used to access and consume the data. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Various stages of highway project construction process involve text, image, audio, video and other related data sources involving many participants, forming a huge amount of data. Accurately tracing the source of responsibility, refining and applying the unbalanced data in the highway project archives is of great significance for realizing the intelligent transformation of highway construction project management. This paper firstly sorts out the construction process of highway projects and the main data sources, constructs a data association network between construction entities and construction process, as well as a knowledge map of highway construction data. Then, according to the highway construction stage, an index system based on 12 key data is constructed by using the entropy weight cloud model method, and the importance of the data is evaluated. Thirdly, based on the unbalanced characteristics of highway project data, a method of mining big data in highway project archives using classification evaluation indexes is proposed, and the accuracy of this method is verified by case calculation. Finally, taking the Shizong Qiubei Expressway in China as an example, the intelligent management and control suggestions for key data of transportation projects are proposed. It is found that the key data with special importance rate in highway construction include construction data, supervision data and completion data. Boosting algorithm is more accurate than the traditional SMOTE algorithm for unbalanced data mining, which helps to save the project construction cost and improve the quality of data extraction in the project archives. This study provides a theoretical reference for key data traceability of highway project intelligent management and control platform and the improvement of intelligent management efficiency. © 2023

AB  - PromG is an extensible Python library for managing and enriching object-centric event data (OCED) and for developing object-centric process mining (OCPM) techniques. It does so by using Event Knowledge Graphs, which model process-related concepts as a property graph in a Neo4j database. The library automatically generates Cypher queries to transform, enhance, and manipulate object-centric event data, giving analysts a straightforward way to explore and analyze object-centric processes. To enable others to develop OCPM techniques, the library is available as a Python package on PyPi and has been tested with real-life examples. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Materials related to Japanese military “comfort women” in Korea are managed by several institutions. Each digital archive has their own metadata schema and management policies. So far, a standard or a common guideline for describing digital records is not formalized. We propose a Japanese military “comfort women” knowledge graph to semantically interlink the digital records from distributed digital archives. To build a Japanese military “comfort women” knowledge graph, digital records and descriptive metadata were collected from existing digital archives. A list of metadata was defined by analyzing commonly used properties and a knowledge model designed by reusing standard vocabularies. Knowledge was constructed by interlinking the collected records, external data sources, and enriching data. The knowledge graph was evaluated using the FAIR data maturity model. © 2023 American Library Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vulnerabilities can cause damages to users. With heavy dependencies among software, it is particularly important to safely select the dependent libraries and maintain security of software in a targeted manner, which require deep understanding of potential weakness of third-party libraries. Current vulnerability advisories only support rough-level description-based vulnerability information searching, which cannot cater the needs of in-depth investigation and understanding of vulnerabilities. Driven by the real needs, we propose a vulnerability aspect-level vulnerability knowledge graph integrating diversified vulnerability key aspect information from heterogeneous vulnerability databases. Based on the knowledge graph, we implement a multi-faceted vulnerability searching website for statistics and details acquiring of vulnerabilities. Our use cases demonstrate the usefulness of our knowledge graph and website to the software security.

AB  - The trend for digitalization of museums has been on the rise in recent years, as museums seek to make their collections and exhibitions more accessible to a wider audience. This has involved the use of technologies such as virtual and augmented reality, online exhibits, and digital archives. These digital initiatives have allowed museums to reach new audiences and provide immersive experiences that enhance visitors' engagement with the exhibits. Following this trend, in the current work, we propose a conversational agent that assists remote visitors in accessing a museum's collection. The proposed architecture includes a chatbot for user interaction that employs Natural Language Processing techniques for understanding the user's input. To increase visitor engagement, a hybrid recommender system is developed that combines content-based and collaborative-filtering components. The available data is modeled in the form of a Knowledge Graph, which allows for useful insights to be extracted from it.  © 2023 ACM.

Most of the e-book resources owned by publishing enterprises are in PDF format, which is not suitable for reading on mobile devices, and it is not convenient to directly extract key information and construct knowledge graph. With this in mind, this article designs a PDF automatic indexing scheme that can identify all the element information in PDF and output structured data automatically and then extract all the key information in it to generate a keyword library with tag weights. The scheme mainly involves two key technical points: parsing PDF based on text features and grammar rules and extracting keywords based on tag weights. The former visualizes the text block in PDF into a rectangular area, divides the elements by clustering algorithm, and, finally, outputs structured data containing all the information. The latter combines the tags and their weights in the structured data and extracts the keywords in it by the inter-word relation algorithm. The structured data and keywords database produced by this scheme can be used to produce intelligent e-book and build knowledge graph, thus helping publishing enterprises to transform from a content service provider to an intelligent knowledge service provider. This transformation can deeply excavate the core value of the content held by the publishing industry and promote the digitization and intelligentization process of the whole industry.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Objective We aimed to conduct bibliometric analysis on relevant studies published in the past 20 years on the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with traditional Chinese medicine, to explore the current situation and development trends, and predict the future research direction. Methods The relevant research literature on the treatment of CKD by traditional Chinese medicine published in the Wanfang database, CNKI, SinoMed, VIP, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase database from 2002 to 2022 was searched. The articles were screened using NoteExpress software, and the authors, institutions, and keywords were identified by CiteSpace 5.8R3 and VOSviewer clustering and emergence analysis software, and a visual knowledge graph was drawn. Results A total of 17,948 articles were included, namely, 14,593 Chinese and 3,355 English articles. The number of publications increased each year, and the trend was stable; there were 884 core authors, including 362 Chinese authors and 522 English authors. A stable group centered on a number of key scholars had been formed in this field, and there was close cooperation among institutions. In the early stage, most of the research focused on the experience of renowned practitioners, clinical observation, and syndrome analysis; and in the later stage, most of the research focused on basic disciplines, such as the physiological and pathological mechanism of CKD and the mechanism of drug action in a multi group context, as well as new emerging disciplines, such as bioinformatics analysis, data mining, and network pharmacology. Conclusion The CKD field is in a steady state of research development, and the direction of clinical development has gradually progressed from efficacy observation to more evidence-based, randomized parallel controlled studies. Basic research in terms of its strength and depth has been increasing over time, and metabolomics has been used as an entry point to explore the potential of traditional Chinese medicine to intervene in the pathological progression of CKD, through autophagy regulation of the immune response, endoplasmic reticulum stress, intestinal mucosal barrier, and intestinal flora, which are likely a key research direction in the near future. © 2023 Editorial Department of Journal of Beijing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

AB  - Knowledge Graphs (KGs) form the backbone of many knowledge dependent applications such as search engines and digital personal assistants. KGs are generally constructed either manually or automatically using a variety of extraction techniques applied over multiple data sources. Due to the diverse quality of these data sources, there are likely anomalies introduced into any KG. Hence, it is unrealistic to expect a perfect archive of knowledge. Given how large KGs can be, manual validation is impractical, necessitating an automated approach for anomaly detection in KGs. To improve KG quality, and to identify interesting and abnormal triples (edges) and entities (nodes) that are worth investigating, we introduce SEKA, a novel unsupervised approach to detect anomalous triples and entities in a KG using both the structural characteristics and the content of edges and nodes of the graph. While an anomaly can be an interesting or unusual discovery, such as a fraudulent transaction requiring human intervention, anomaly detection can also identify potential errors. We propose a novel approach named Corroborative Path Algorithm to generate a matrix of semantic features, which we then use to train a one-class Support Vector Machine to identify abnormal triples and entities with no dependency on external sources. We evaluate our approach on four real-world KGs demonstrating the ability of SEKA to detect anomalies, and to outperform comparative baselines.  © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - We develop a multimodal classifier for the cultural heritage domain using a late fusion approach and introduce a novel dataset. The three modalities are Image, Text, and Tabular data. We based the image classifier on a ResNet convolutional neural network architecture and the text classifier on a multilingual transformer architecture (XML-Roberta). Both are trained as multitask classifiers. Tabular data and late fusion are handled by Gradient Tree Boosting. We also show how we leveraged a specific data model and taxonomy in a Knowledge Graph to create the dataset and to store classification results. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: In this study, the distinctive functional features of linked data (LD) catalogues were investigated to contrast with existing online public access catalogues (OPACs) and discovery systems using a checklist approach. The checklist was derived from a literature review and is composed of 10 items as follows: self-descriptive and dynamic content for resource description, linkage to external LD sources and online services, aggregation of knowledge contexts into knowledge graphs (KGs), URI-based link discovery, representation and query of LD relationships, URI-based serendipitous discovery, keyword recommendation, faceted limitation and browsing, visualization and openness of data. Design/methodology/approach: Ten functional features derived from the literature were checked against existing LD catalogues offered by libraries, archives and museums (LAMs). The LD catalogues were regarded as qualified subjects if they offered functional features that were distinct from current OPACs and discovery systems through URI-based enrichment and aggregation from various LD sources. In addition to individual organizations, LD union catalogues were also included. However, LD hubs, such as ISNI, OCLC WorldCat Entities, VIAF and Wikidata, were excluded. In total, six LD catalogues from LAMs were selected as subjects for examination. Findings: First, LD catalogues provide similar KG information through URI combination, and KGs also facilitate information serendipity, including social-document, intellectual, conceptual, spatial and temporal contexts and networks of corporate bodies, persons and families (CPFs). Second, LD catalogues have transformed the “seek first and browse later” paradigm into a “seek or browse” paradigm by refreshing the browsing function of traditional card catalogues with preview and new options to facilitate LD identification and discovery. Third, LD catalogues have refined keyword recommendation with the addition of the following fields: person’s title, CPF relationships, entity type and LD source. Lastly, a virtual union LD catalogue is offered. Research limitations/implications: The proposed checklist revealed the unique/improved functional features of LD catalogues, allowing further investigation and comparison. More cases from the fields of medicine, engineering science and so on will be required to make revisions to fine-tune the proposed checklist approach. Originality/value: To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first study to propose a checklist of functional features for LD catalogues and examine what the results and features of LD catalogues have achieved and are supported by from ontologies across LAMs. The findings suggest that LD provides a viable alternative to catalogues. The proposed checklist and results pave the way for the future development of LD catalogues and next-generation catalogues and also provide a basis for the future study of LD catalogues from other fields to refine the proposed checklist. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Data users need relevant context and research expertise to effectively search for and identify relevant datasets. Leading data providers, such as the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), offer standardized metadata and search tools to support data search. Metadata standards emphasize the machine-readability of data and its documentation. There are opportunities to enhance dataset search by improving users' ability to learn about, and make sense of, information about data. Prior research has shown that context and expertise are two main barriers users face in effectively searching for, evaluating, and deciding whether to reuse data. In this paper, we propose a novel chatbot-based search system, DataChat, that leverages a graph database and a large language model to provide novel ways for users to interact with and search for research data. DataChat complements data archives' and institutional repositories' ongoing efforts to curate, preserve, and share research data for reuse by making it easier for users to explore and learn about available research data.

AB  - The ever-evolving and intricate nature of cyber environments, coupled with the escalating risk of cyber-attacks, necessitates robust solutions in the realm of cybersecurity. Knowledge graphs have emerged as a promising avenue for consolidating, representing, managing, and reasoning over cyber threat intelligence. However, applying knowledge graphs to tackle real-world challenges in cyber-attack and defense scenarios remains an area requiring further exploration. This paper aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of the fundamental concepts, schema design, and construction methodologies for the cybersecurity knowledge graph. To facilitate future research endeavors, we have carefully curated datasets and open-source libraries tailored for knowledge construction and information extraction tasks. Furthermore, we present a detailed comparative review of recent advancements in the application scenarios of cybersecurity knowledge graphs. To provide clarity and organization, we introduce a novel classification framework that categorizes interconnected works into distinct primary categories and subcategories. The paper concludes by outlining potential research directions in the cybersecurity knowledge graph domain, paving the way for further advancements and innovations in the field. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Data recordings of the movement of vehicles can be enriched with heterogeneous and multimodal data beyond latitude, longitude, and timestamp and enhanced with complementary segmentations, constituting a semantic trajectory. Semantic Web (SW) technologies have been extensively used for the semantic integration of heterogeneous and multimodal movement-related data, and for the effective modeling of semantic trajectories, in several domains. In this paper, we present an integrated solution for the engineering of cultural heritage semantic trajectories generated from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and represented as knowledge graphs (KGs). Particularly, this work is motivated by, and evaluated based on, the application domain of UAV missions for documenting regions/points of cultural heritage interest. In this context, this research work extends our previous work on UAV semantic trajectories, contributing (a) an updated methodology for the engineering of semantic trajectories as KGs (STaKG), (b) an implemented toolset for the management of KG-based semantic trajectories, (c) a refined ontology for the representation of knowledge related to UAV semantic trajectories and to cultural heritage documentation, and (d) the application and evaluation of the proposed methodology, the developed toolset, and the ontology within the domain of UAV-based cultural heritage documentation. The evaluation of the integrated UAV solution was achieved by exploiting real datasets collected during three UAV missions to document sites of cultural interest in Lesvos, Greece, i.e., the UNESCO-protected petrified forest of Lesvos Petrified Forest/Geopark, the village of Vrissa, and University Hill. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - CIDOC-CRM is an event-based international standard for cultural documentation that has been widely used for offering semantic interoperability in the Cultural Heritage (CH) domain. Although there are several Knowledge Graphs (KGs) expressed by using CIDOC-CRM, the task of Question Answering (QA) has not been studied over such graphs. For this reason, in this paper we propose and evaluate a Radius-based QA pipeline over CIDOC-CRM KGs for single-entity factoid questions. In particular, we propose a generic QA pipeline that comprises several models and methods, including a keyword search model for recognizing the entity of the question (and linking it to the KG), methods that are based on path expansion for constructing subgraphs of different radius (i.e., path lengths) starting from the recognized entity, i.e., for being used as a context, and pre-trained neural models (based on BERT) for answering the question using the mentioned context. Moreover, since there are no available benchmarks over CIDOC-CRM KGs, we construct (by using a real KG) an evaluation benchmark having 10,000 questions, i.e., 5,000 single-entity factoid, 2,500 comparative and 2,500 confirmation questions. For evaluating the QA pipeline, we use the 5,000 single-entity factoid questions. Concerning the results, the QA pipeline achieves satisfactory results both in the entity recognition step (78% accuracy) and in the QA process (51% F1 score). © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - An interesting application for social robots is to act as a presenter, for example as a museum guide. In this paper, we present a fully automated system architecture for building adaptive presentations for embodied agents. The presentation is generated from a knowledge graph, which is also used to track the grounding state of information, based on multimodal feedback from the user. We introduce a novel way to use large-scale language models (GPT-3 in our case) to lexicalise arbitrary knowledge graph triples, greatly simplifying the design of this aspect of the system. We also present an evaluation where 43 participants interacted with the system. The results show that users prefer the adaptive system and consider it more human-like and flexible than a static version of the same system, but only partial results are seen in their learning of the facts presented by the robot.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Recently, deep learning has started to play an essential role in healthcare applications, including image search in digital pathology. Despite the recent progress in computer vision, significant issues remain for image searching in histopathology archives. A well-known problem is AI bias and lack of generalization. A more particular shortcoming of deep models is the ignorance toward search functionality. The former affects every model, the latter only search and matching. Due to the lack of ranking-based learning, researchers must train models based on the classification error and then use the resultant embedding for image search purposes. Moreover, deep models appear to be prone to internal bias even if using a large image repository of various hospitals. This paper proposes two novel ideas to improve image search performance. First, we use a ranking loss function to guide feature extraction toward the matching-oriented nature of the search. By forcing the model to learn the ranking of matched outputs, the representation learning is customized toward image search instead of learning a class label. Second, we introduce the concept of sequestering learning to enhance the generalization of feature extraction. By excluding the images of the input hospital from the matched outputs, i.e., sequestering the input domain, the institutional bias is reduced. The proposed ideas are implemented and validated through the largest public dataset of whole slide images. The experiments demonstrate superior results compare to the-state-of-art. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - At present, most enterprises and organizations attach great importance to the establishment of knowledge base in order to condense and summarize their core competitiveness, so as to inherit knowledge. However, at present, most of the knowledge base is a document library, and the structured information in the knowledge base is very lacking. Based on this, this paper proposes a knowledge embedding vector technology, which combines keyword extraction and text self-coding technology, so as to abstract and represent knowledge semantically in embedded vector space, and achieve the purpose of enriching structured information in knowledge base. Moreover, the knowledge embedding vector technology proposed in this paper can provide theoretical basis for the upper application of knowledge base, such as knowledge graph construction, knowledge search, knowledge recommendation and application.  © 2023 ACM.

AB  - Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is performed to realize intelligent power consumption. A load identification algorithm which is flexible for various households is required to realize automatic NILM. An approach of NILM proposed in this paper is general for most types of loads and exclusive for different users. In this paper, inspired by the knowledge graph holding strong power for knowledge representing, a load feature graph that preserves sufficient information is constructed. The graph provides a net relation between load types and features, which is the basis of load knowledge reasoning. After transforming current and voltage into structured images and data according to the net relation, the convolutional neural networks and combined Support Vector Machines are used to classify images and data respectively. Furthermore, to minimize running time, a customized load identity library focusing on the individual user is proposed. Considering requirements of different computing power resources, above processes are deployed on the architecture of end-cloud collaboration. The experimental results on NILM datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms most of the existing methods in the recognition accuracy and supports for different types of users.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents ARCA, a software system that enables semantic search and exploration over a book catalog. The main purpose of this work is twofold: to propose a general paradigm for a semantic enrichment workflow and to evaluate a visual approach to information retrieval based on extracted information and existing knowledge graphs. ARCA has been designed and implemented following a user-centered design approach. Two different releases of the system have incrementally and iteratively developed and evaluated. The first release has evaluated the quality and usefulness of the extracted data. The second release, whose design was a refinement based on the previous evaluation results, was assessed by several users. Moreover, a comparative test with other information retrieval systems was conducted in order to study the potential added-value of the system. ARCA is employed in a real editorial scenario to visually search and explore the books of a publishing house. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Over the last decade, several projects have been developed to digitise and semanticise cultural heritage data. They have been developed to preserve and maintain this heritage, but also to make it accessible to all types of users and to other sectors such as tourism and education. These developments combine the use of knowledge graphs and interactive visualisation tools with web technologies. Although remarkably interesting projects have been developed, the data visualisation tools in these projects tend to focus on the project context. Consequently, it is difficult to reuse the results of these projects. In addition, there are characteristics of cultural heritage information, such as uncertainty and spatial and temporal granularity, that have not been considered, and how to deal with them has not been described. The same is true for other aspects, such as the relationships between different objects. Considering these problems, this study presents a model that formalises how to visualise this information. The design of an ontology that implements this model, based on other works such as VUMO or VISO, is described. Furthermore, the design and development of a software framework that allows the visualisation of this information through a web application are presented. The evaluation of the application of this framework in projects such as SILKNOW or Arxiu Valencià del Disseny is outlined. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Deep learning (DL) is difficult to provide explanations verified by non-Technical audiences such as end-users or domain experts. This paper uses symbolic knowledge in the form of an expert knowledge graph, and proposes an interpretable neural-symbol learning (RF-YOLOv5) method, designed to learn symbols and deep representations. Finally, the deep learning representation and knowledge map are integrated in the learning process, so as a good basis for interpretability. Among them, the RF-YOLOv5 method involves specific two aspects of interpretation, respectively in reasoning and training time (1) YOLOv5-EXPLANet: experts alignment explained part of the auxiliary network architecture, combined convolutional neural network, using symbol representation, and (2) interpretable artificial intelligence training process, correct and guide the DL process and such symbol representation form of knowledge graph. The camera is placed above the refrigerator to detect the variety of ingredients, and then used in the RF-YOLOv5 method recommended by Zhejiang cuisine recipes, and demonstrates that using our method can improve interpretability while improving interpretability.  © 2023 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - This paper introduces an experimental study for building knowledge graphs about queer communities with different perspectives. The paper describes a set of pipelines implementing several knowledge graphs construction strategies that lead to a complementary understanding of the queer communities. We implemented a library with the knowledge graph construction pipelines and conducted experiments to evaluate execution cost against the comprehensiveness of the content. The library includes visualization tools for observing the knowledge graphs concerning several granularities. Finally, we use storytelling to provide a first interpretation of our results regarding the profiling of queer communities. © 2023 Copyright © 2023 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - To facilitate discovery of premodern manuscripts in U.S. memory institutions, Digital Scriptorium, a growing consortium of over 35 institutional members representing American libraries, museums, and other cultural heritage institutions, has developed a digital platform for an online national union catalog. The platform will allow low-barrier and efficient collection, aggregation, and enrichment of member metadata and sustainably publish it as Linked Open Data. This article describes the methods and principles behind the data model development and the decision to use Wikibase. The results of the prototype implementation and testing phase demonstrate the practicality and sustainability of Digital Scriptorium's approach to building an online national union catalog based on Linked Open Data technologies and practices.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have produced a new form of semantic indexing that lets users enhance searches and gain new insights into their media libraries. Unlike typical search systems that use extracted metadata, semantic indexing allows users to find relevant material without the need to tag the media with selections from a predefined taxonomy. With semantic search, users can simply enter unstructured text, and the system will find the best matching media clips. This article extends the use of this technology to gather analytics on the data, which can then be further correlated to generate various insights. This new form of media indexing can be performed with the contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) model from OpenAI for images and similar models for video and audio. These models encode media into embeddings that can be searched to find the closest semantic similarity, enhanced with learned cultural knowledge. These systems have the benefit of finding media based on keywords, synonyms, and summaries. The systems can also be used for analytics and insights, such as segmentation, shot detection, and creating a 2D map to display correlations. This article ends with a discussion of the next steps, including using knowledge graphs for semantic search.  © 2002 Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, Inc.

AB  - Nowadays, geopolitical, extreme weather and other emergencies have exacerbated the global energy crisis, and thus, have increased the urgency of the world’s transition to sustainable energy. Sustainable energy policies play an important role in the process of sustainable energy transformation. The research on sustainable energy policy is mainly carried out through conventional qualitative and quantitative methods, in which bibliometrics and meta-analysis methods are paid attention to; however, the mining and analysis of the semantics of the relationships between policies are ignored. This paper uses knowledge graph technology to build a knowledge graph of China’s sustainable energy policy by using 10,815 open official documents of sustainable energy policy issued by China from 1981 to 2022. It forms the relevant policy archive storage and details related organizations. The legal source can be traced through the graph database, where the powerful synergy can be seen, and the policy focus can be monitored. In terms of structural data, this paper uses graph algorithms to identify key policy nodes at different stages, to identify the key government departments for policy issuance and cluster policy issuance departments, and it investigates China’s policy evolution in the issue of sustainable energy policies, the evolution of policy issuance departments, and the power co-evolution process between policy issuance departments. The research found that: (1) China’s sustainable energy policy was initiated in environmental protection, and the relevant policies on collecting pollution charges has continued to play an important policy node. Additionally, the three versions of the Environmental Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China have successively become the main legal source of other sustainable energy transformation policies. (2) The prominent feature of China’s sustainable energy policy transformation has involved transforming the process where the issuance of policies came from a single department to the joint issuance of documents by multiple departments. The joint exercise of government functions and powers by multiple departments jointly promotes sustainable energy policies’ implementation and play. (3) In the future, when formulating sustainable energy policies, the Chinese government should focus on the strategic and systematic aspects of the policies, so that the sustainable energy policies can meet both short-term and long-term development goals. At the same time, the synergy of various policies and measures should be fully played in implementing sustainable energy policies. The establishment of the policy knowledge graph based on publicly-open official documents can facilitate the analysis and visualization of sustainable energy policies, providing new ideas for policy research. This paper introduces the knowledge graph, graph machine learning algorithms and big data technology, which can deepen the depth and breadth of people’s research on sustainable energy policy. This study will help the public policy formulation work in the future and has a positive reference value for the evaluation of the implementation effect of policy objectives. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Virtual Reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance cultural heritage experiences by providing immersive environments. This study proposes a novel approach that combines VR environments with eye-tracking data to identify users’ points of interest in exhibition paintings. By leveraging gaze patterns, valuable insights into user preferences, behavior, and attention can be extracted and integrated into the cultural heritage knowledge graph. To achieve this, an object detection model is fine-tuned on historical artwork datasets, and statistical tests are conducted to analyze gaze-object correlations. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using an object detection algorithm to detect points of interest and reveal correlations between eye gaze patterns and meaningful objects in paintings. This approach has the potential to enrich the knowledge graph, enabling more personalized and immersive experiences for art enthusiasts and visitors. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The volume of ribonucleic acid (RNA)-seq data has increased exponentially, providing numerous new insights into various biological processes. However, due to significant practical challenges, such as data heterogeneity, it is still difficult to ensure the quality of these data when integrated. Although some quality control methods have been developed, sample consistency is rarely considered and these methods are susceptible to artificial factors. Here, we developed MassiveQC, an unsupervised machine learning-based approach, to automatically download and filter large-scale high-throughput data. In addition to the read quality used in other tools, MassiveQC also uses the alignment and expression quality as model features. Meanwhile, it is user-friendly since the cutoff is generated from self-reporting and is applicable to multimodal data. To explore its value, we applied MassiveQC to Drosophila RNA-seq data and generated a comprehensive transcriptome atlas across 28 tissues from embryogenesis to adulthood. We systematically characterized fly gene expression dynamics and found that genes with high expression dynamics were likely to be evolutionarily young and expressed at late developmental stages, exhibiting high nonsynonymous substitution rates and low phenotypic severity, and they were involved in simple regulatory programs. We also discovered that human and Drosophila had strong positive correlations in gene expression in orthologous organs, revealing the great potential of the Drosophila system for studying human development and disease. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Cultural heritage collections available as linked open data (LOD) may contain harmful stereotypes about people and cultures, for example, in outdated textual descriptions of objects. Galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM) have suggested various approaches to tackle potentially problematic content in digital collections. However, the domain expertise and discussions about words and phrases used in LOD-collections are scattered across different resources and detached from the collections themselves. In this paper, we capture domain expertise about English and Dutch contentious heritage terminology in a knowledge graph. Contentious terms in the resulting graph are then linked to entities from other LOD-resources used in the cultural domain and beyond, including Wikidata and WordNet. We make our design decisions explicit and report on the linking process. The developed knowledge graph makes expert knowledge interoperable, so it can be reused by the cultural heritage community and other LOD-developers to contribute to a more inclusive representation of cultural heritage on the Web. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - [Purpose/Significance] Knowledge Graph has become a major research hotspot in the era of artificial intelligence due to its ability to provide a new means of organization and representation of knowledge. As the field continues to evolve, numerous scholars have proposed advanced algorithms and technologies for each core stage of constructing a knowledge graph, and many large domestic and foreign enterprises have also developed their independent knowledge graph management systems. However, the majority of these graph tools developed are designed for commercial use and are often too expensive and difficult to deploy locally for small and medium-sized research teams. This presents a challenge for information organizations such as research libraries with massive resources, which require a more adaptable, universal, and efficient tool to build and manage knowledge graphs. To meet this need, it is important to develop an open-source, user-friendly, and customizable knowledge graph management system that can be easily deployed by small and medium-sized research teams. [Method/Process] In summary, this article offers a thorough and informative analysis of six mainstream knowledge graph management systems, both domestically and internationally. It delves into the unique characteristics of each system within the business process and provides an in-depth comparative analysis based on several important factors, including system functionality, technology selection, open-source availability, and application domains. The article refers to the standard construction process of knowledge graphs and highlights the platform characteristics of each system during the construction process while also examining their limitations based on current data characteristics. In response to practical needs, the article focuses on multi-path, multi-engine, distributed, and collaborative construction, integrating advanced graph algorithms and considering a well-developed underlying graph storage strategy. [Results/Conclusions] As a result袁 the article presents an in-depth analysis of the construction model for a collaborative development and management system of an integrated knowledge graph. It not only investigates the current state of knowledge graph management systems but also proposes novel optimization ideas. These ideas include distributed collaborative construction, which allows for simultaneous contributions from multiple sources, and parallel management of multiple graphs, enabling efficient organization and retrieval. Additionally, some suggestions are put forward: developing multi-path knowledge extraction techniques to enhance the knowledge acquisition process, and using specialized multi-graph storage engines for optimized storage and retrieval. Last, the article emphasizes the importance of incorporating cross-media and multimodal knowledge into the graph for a comprehensive representation of information. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) encompasses transcranial stimulation techniques that can influence brain excitability. These techniques have the potential to treat conditions like depression, anxiety, and chronic pain, and to provide insights into brain function. However, a lack of standardized reporting practices limits its reproducibility and full clinical potential. This paper aims to foster interdisciplinarity toward adopting Computer Science Semantic reporting methods for the standardized documentation of Neuroscience NIBS studies making them explicitly Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). In a large-scale systematic review of 600 repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a subarea of NIBS, dosages, we describe key properties that allow for structured descriptions and comparisons of the studies. This paper showcases the semantic publishing of NIBS in the ecosphere of knowledge-graph-based next-generation scholarly digital libraries. Specifically, the FAIR Semantic Web resource(s)-based publishing paradigm is implemented for the 600 reviewed rTMS studies in the Open Research Knowledge Graph. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - In recent years, oil and gas field surface engineering construction projects tend to be large in scale, large in quantity, and short in cycle. The task of surface construction management has increased significantly. In the process of project construction, corresponding standards and specifications are required to provide sufficient technical guidance and support for design, construction, and management personnel to ensure project management and control towards compliance, safety, and quality. However, the oil and gas field engineering standards are numerous and specialized, involving different levels of national standards, enterprise standards, and industry standards, which leads to the inefficiency of the actual use of standards and specifications. To solve them, this paper uses knowledge graph technology, OCR recognition, and natural language processing technology to conduct systematic research on the knowledge classification mechanism, data extraction, database construction mechanism, data structuring, and intelligent retrieval matching of oil-gas field surface engineering construction standards. In this study, the structured identification, storage, and information warehousing of standards are realized, and a highly sharable library of standards and specifications is formed, which realizes the intelligent retrieval and pushing of technical standards for surface engineering construction. This paper creates conditions for the realization of intelligent push and benchmarking management of standards and specifications, providing support for digital transformation and intelligent development of oil–gas fields. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Visual analysis of library reader service research and linear regression analysis are conducted to point out the closeness and changing rules of different influencing factors and the overall service quality of the library, providing suggestions for the optimization direction of library service problems in the future. In the CNKI database, the data in the field of “library reader service” is used as the initial data, and the knowledge map is used to analyze and study the research hotspots in this field. The questionnaire is designed based on the results, and the regression analysis is conducted on the questionnaire data. The research hotspots in the field of library reader service mainly focus on four aspects: reader service, reading service, environmental service and activity organization. By combining these four aspects to provide multi-level services, libraries can adapt to the rapid development of libraries in the new century. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Digital archives of memory institutions are typically concerned with the cataloguing of artefacts of artistic, historical, and cultural value. Recently, new forms of citizen participation in cultural heritage have emerged, producing a wealth of material spanning from visitors’ experiential feedback on exhibitions and cultural artefacts to digitally mediated interactions like those on social media platforms. We discuss the problems of integrating citizen experiences in cultural heritage archives. There are good reasons for institutions to archive people’s responses to cultural objects and to study the impact on knowledge infrastructures. By analysing the case studies of the EU-funded SPICE project, we argue that a knowledge organisation system for “data journeys” can help disentangle problems that include distribution, sense-making, ownership, sensitivity, privacy, and rights management. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The performing arts are complex, dynamic and embedded into societal and political systems. Providing means to research historical performing arts data is therefore crucial for understanding our history and culture. However, currently no commonly accepted ontology for historical performing arts data exists. On the example of the Linked Stage Graph, this position paper presents the ongoing process of creating an application-driven and efficient data model by leveraging and building upon existing standards and ontologies like CIDOC-CRM, FRBR, and FRBRoo. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Citations in a scientific paper reference other studies and form the information backbone of that paper. If cited literature is valid and non-retracted, an analysis of citations can offer unique perspectives about the supportive or contradictory nature of a statement. Yet, such analyses are still limited by the relative lack of access to open citation data. The creation of open citation databases (OCDs) allows for data analysts, bibliometric specialists, and other academics interested in such topics to independently verify the validity and accuracy of a citation. Since the strength of an individual's curriculum vitae can be based on, and assessed by, metrics (citation counts, altmetric mentions, journal ranks, etc.), there is interest in appreciating citation networks and their link to research performance. Open citations would thus not only benefit career, funding, and employment initiatives, but they could also be used to reveal citation rings, abusive author-author or journal-journal citation strategies, or to detect false or erroneous citations. OCDs should be open to the public, and publishers have a moral responsibility of releasing citation data for free use and academic exploration. Some challenges remain, including long-term funding, and data and information security.  © University of Toronto Press.

AB  - Currently, most knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) systems need to retrieve all entities when dealing with complex problems involving multiple entities and relationships, which results in high time complexity and resource consumption. The response time of KGQA systems is an important indicator for evaluating their performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Chinese KGQA system based on dense relationship retrieval. The system uses the Faiss index mechanism for vector similarity retrieval, quickly extracts the top K relationships from the pre-built vector relationship library, and constructs paths to reduce a large number of irrelevant semantic paths in most KGQA tasks, thereby improving the time cost and computational resource overhead caused by the exponential growth of path numbers in second-order and higher-order questions. By using this method, the response time of the QA system can be shortened to within 1 second with minimal loss of accuracy. This paper combines pre-training models to complete tasks such as text semantic similarity and entity mention recognition, and achieves an average F1 value of 71.3% on the CCKS2019-CKBQA test set. Comparing with other systems demonstrates the superiority of our method in terms of accuracy and efficiency. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Tuina is an effective treatment for neck pain (NP). However, there has been no bibliometric analysis of the global application and emerging trends of tuina performed for NP. Therefore, this study aimed to provide an overview of the current state and future trends in the field. Articles about tuina for NP, published from January 1, 2013, to January 1, 2023, were searched in the Web of Science Core Collection database. CiteSpace (6.1.R6) and VOSviewer (1.6.18) software were used to analyze annual trends in literature posts, countries, institutions, authors, cited references, and knowledge graphs of keyword co-occurrence, clustering, and burst using standard bibliometric indicators. The final analysis comprised 505 valid documents. The results demonstrate that the number of articles in the field of tuina therapy for NP has gradually increased over the years, showing the most active countries, institutions, journals, and authors. There were 323 keywords in the field, 322 research authors, and 292 research institutions, with the USA having the most publications (n = 140). The most published institution is Vrije University Amsterdam, and the most published journal is the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Peter R Blanpied is the most influential and most-cited author. Interventions (dry needling, massage therapy, and muscle energy techniques), common treatment sites for NP (upper trapezius), and complications (cervicogenic headache) are the top three frontiers mentioned in the field of tuina research for NP. The bibliometric study showed the current status and trends in clinical research on treating patients with NP using tuina, which may help researchers identify topics of interest and scope for future research in this field. © 2023 Gong et al.

AB  - Understanding the elements that allow the recognition of archaeological structures is an essential task for the identification of cultural heritage. On the other hand, recording these elements is necessary for the historical study, evolution, and recognition of these types of structures. One of the challenges presented for the digital representation of this information and knowledge relates to the fact that there are results from different surveys and records on the status of the same monument, that can be considered as separate versions of knowledge. In this paper, we describe a schema to represent versioning data about archaeological heritage dolmens using the CIDOC-CRM model as a basis. The versioning schema will work as a database model for the development of a knowledge graph to aid with automatized dolmen recognition in images. The intended model efficiently stores and retrieves event-driven data, exposing how each update creates a new “version” of a new event. An event-driven model based on versioning data makes it possible to perform comparisons of versions produced at different times or people and allows for the creation of complex version chains and trees. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Background: Health promotion can empower populations to gain more control over their well-being by using digital interventions that focus on preventing the root causes of diseases. Digital platforms for personalized health coaching can improve health literacy and information-seeking behavior, leading to better health outcomes. Personal health records have been designed to enhance patients’ self-management of a disease or condition. Existing personal health records have been mostly designed and deployed as a supplementary service that acts as views into electronic health records. Objective: We aim to overcome some of the limitations of electronic health records. This study aims to design and develop a personal health library (PHL) that generates personalized recommendations for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine promotion and cancer prevention. Methods: We have designed a proof-of-concept prototype of the Digital Personal Health Librarian, which leverages machine learning; natural language processing; and several innovative technological infrastructures, including the Semantic Web, social linked data, web application programming interfaces, and hypermedia-based discovery, to generate a personal health knowledge graph. Results: We have designed and implemented a proof-of-the-concept prototype to showcase and demonstrate how the PHL can be used to store an individual’s health data, for example, a personal health knowledge graph. This is integrated with web-scale knowledge to support HPV vaccine promotion and prevent HPV-associated cancers among adolescents and their caregivers. We also demonstrated how the Digital Personal Health Librarian uses the PHL to provide evidence-based insights and knowledge-driven explanations that are personalized and inform health decision-making. Conclusions: Digital platforms such as the PHL can be instrumental in improving precision health promotion and education strategies that address population-specific needs (ie, health literacy, digital competency, and language barriers) and empower individuals by facilitating knowledge acquisition to make healthy choices. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - A major gap in the biodiversity knowledge graph is a connection between taxonomic names and the taxonomic literature. While both names and publications often have persistent identifiers (PIDs), such as Life Science Identifiers (LSIDs) or Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), LSIDs for names are rarely linked to DOIs for publications. This article describes efforts to make those connections across three large taxonomic databases: Index Fungorum, International Plant Names Index (IPNI) and the Index of Organism Names (ION). Over a million names have been matched to DOIs or other persistent identifiers for taxonomic publications. This represents approximately 36% of names for which publication data are available. The mappings between LSIDs and publication PIDs are made available through ChecklistBank. Applications of this mapping are discussed, including a web app to locate the citation of a taxonomic name and a knowledge graph that uses data on researcher ORCID ids to connect taxonomic names and publications to authors of those names. © Page R.

AB  - Folklore culture is the summary and embodiment of a way of life, a normative form for people, covering local life in rural communities. A folklore museum typically displays historical objects used as part of people’s everyday lives. The representation of information in the digital realm is an important aspect of cultural heritage institutions, with museums taking over a considerable proportion. Having taken into consideration requirements set by the existing literature and examining relevant research and approaches, the authors developed an analysis framework including 16 popular folklore museums around the world, in order to examine various aspects of their digital presence. More specifically, the authors followed a two-fold methodological approach conducting a functionality and semantic analysis of the chosen museums with the purpose of determining the current approaches and tendencies with respect to representation schemata for folklore museum artifacts and their digital representation.

AB  - The study of Sumerian texts often requires domain experts to examine a vast number of tables. However, the absence of user-friendly tools for this process poses challenges and consumes significant time. In addressing this issue, we introduce an open-source library that empowers domain experts with minimal technical expertise to automate manual and repetitive tasks using a no-code dashboard. Our library includes an information extraction module that enables the automatic extraction of names and relations based on the user-defined lists of name tags and relation types. By utilizing the tool to facilitate the creation of knowledge graphs, which is a data representation method offering insights into the relationships among entities in the data, we demonstrate its practical application in the analysis of Sumerian texts. © RANLP-ALP 2023 - Proceedings of the Ancient Language Processing Workshop, associated with 14th International Conference on Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing.

AB  - The proliferation of data on the Web has resulted in an increased need for effective techniques to extract relevant and valuable knowledge from this data. The intersection of the fields of Information Extraction and Semantic Web has created new opportunities to improve ontology-based information extraction tools. However, the development and evaluation of such systems have been hampered by the scarcity of annotated documents, particularly in historical domains. This article discusses the current state of our work in creating a large RDF dataset that aims to support the development of ontology-based extraction tools. The dataset was created through manual annotation by domain experts as part of the arkivo project and contains approximately 300,000 triples, which are freely available. This dataset can be used as a benchmark to evaluate systems that automatically extract entities and annotate documents. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - We introduce the UNSC-Graph, a knowledge graph for a corpus of debates of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) during the period 1995-2020. The graph combines previously disconnected data sources including from the UNSC Repertoire, the UN Library, Wikidata, and from metadata extracted from the speeches themselves. Beyond existing metadata detailing debates’ topics and participants, we also extended the graph to include all country mentions in a speech, geographical neighbours of countries mentioned, as well as sentiment scores. By linking the graph to Wikidata, we are able to include additional geopolitical information and extract various country name aliases to extend the coverage of country mentions beyond existing NER-based approaches. Studying mentions of Ukraine after 2014, we present a use case for the graph as a source for continuous analysis of international politics and geopolitical events discussed in the UNSC. ©2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Software supply chain attacks have become more prevalent due to attacker’s higher skills and sophisticated attack methods. These attacks can go unnoticed for a long time and cause widespread damage. Therefore, monitoring all software products in the supply chain to detect these attacks is crucial. However, the software supply chain is com-plex, and tracking suspicious changes to third-party products, services, and libraries used to build software products can be challenging. This makes it difficult for developers to identify and confirm vulnerabilities in the software. Even one vulnerable file in the supply chain can have severe consequences if exploited, so regular vulnerability checks are necessary to keep software products safe. To address this issue, we propose a Vulnerability Assessment Tool that identifies newly found vulnerabilities from public databases and efficiently checks them in existing internal products. Our method uses a two-step process. The first step is estimating related products and directly affected products for a given CVE ID. The second step is a detailed check of the vulnerabilities in the system based on the results estimated in Step 1. This assessment method reduces the time the PSIRT Analyst requires to assess the vulnerabilities. © 2023 Information Processing Society of Japan.

AB  - The analysis and understanding of artifact properties and their relationships is a key objective in the archaeological analysis of cultural heritage objects. There are many aspects of concern, including both shape properties of the objects as a whole and appearances stemming from paintings and ornamentations on the object surfaces. To date, experts consider those mostly holistically on a per-object basis. We present an approach for the interactive visual exploration and correlation of shape-and ornament-based properties of a large collection of ancient vessels. Our approach allows us to group objects by said properties, and to relate them in side-by-side and bipartite graph dis-plays. To this end, we define an encompassing set of feature descriptors, which are leveraged to cluster the objects by user-selected properties. Case studies show that a comparative overview of all objects effectively supports the discovery of interesting co-occurrences of shapes and ornaments. This way, our tool opens new possibilities for the domain analysis of cultural heritage object collections by data-driven visual exploration. © 2023, Vaclav Skala Union Agency. All rights reserved.

AB  - In response to the problems of dispersed professional knowledge, complex management system, and complex business processes in the infrastructure business control of State Grid Corporation, this article proposes a personnel safety risk warning technology based on power infrastructure samples. Firstly, preprocess the scattered infrastructure business data to form a high-quality infrastructure sample library; Next, based on the sample library, a safety risk knowledge graph for infrastructure personnel is constructed based on dynamic graphs; Finally, based on the constructed safety risk knowledge graph of infrastructure personnel, the PinSage model and DynGCN model are combined to capture the spatial structure features and time series features of the dynamic graph. The model is trained through comparative learning, and knowledge inference technology is used to predict the risk information of construction personnel, achieving rapid identification and warning of typical risk sections, providing intelligent auxiliary decision-making for the assessment of personnel behavior and facility status risks on the infrastructure site.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Over the last few years, there has been a significant increase in the release of massive amounts of data related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This has been driven by the recognition that data is critical for monitoring progress towards the SDGs, identifying areas that require attention, and informing policy decisions. Given that a significant percentage of the provided information is made available in documents, the availability of software libraries that can enable scientists to easily extract information regarding the importance given to the SDGs in the documents’ text is considered crucial. Towards this direction, we have developed an open-source Python software library that provides the mapping between text and the SDGs, taking advantage of novel machine learning techniques. The provided software library is modular and permits the dynamic selection of trained machine learning models for analysis purposes. The outcomes from the usage of the software library are fed for data population of a knowledge graph that is targeted to the tracking of information around the SDGs. The overall approach is open and can be easily adopted by scientists and policy makers to support participatory modeling processes, as well as participatory decision making and action planning for the development of solutions for climate-resilient regions. © 2023 CEUR-WS.

AB  - The moral values present in classical texts are only implicitly codified and are a form of intangible cultural heritage. In this paper, we focus on capturing the perceptions of these references of values, with the aim to study how they evolve over space and time. To this end, we present our approach that consists of a meta-model and two intertwined design processes for the creation of a knowledge graph capable of capturing an integrated representation of both values and perceptions. In particular, we illustrate how the input collected from different activities with the general public can feed the graph to represent multiple and possibly divergent perceptions of values in classical texts. Our meta-model allows for the integration of data from both established scientific techniques such as expert annotations on the one hand, and on the other from standard tests, social media activity, visual representations and games. The proposed approach gives practical means to make explicit both historical and current perceptions of values in classical works of art. Our approach and the resulting knowledge graph enable the comparative analysis of values and their perceptions over space and time. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Academic libraries have a long tradition of collecting, preserving, and offering access to information about doctoral dissertations through the repositories of electronic theses and dissertations. In recent years libraries have turned their attention to Wikidata as a knowledge graph for publishing structured data on the Web. These initiatives include the publication of metadata about theses and dissertations. However, Wikidata is a sociotechnical infrastructure, where the responsibility for its development is in the hands of its users. This includes asynchronous collaborative work on its ontology by many non-expert users. This may cause tensions between traditional metadata control and socially developed schemas. The goal of this article is to develop a conceptual understanding of the representation patterns of doctoral dissertations in a socially constructed Wikidata knowledge graph. This study uses an interpretative approach guided by the method of the close reading of the infrastructure to develop an understanding of what a doctoral dissertation is in this socially constructed representation of reality and how doctoral dissertations are described using Wikidata ontology. The ontological status of the doctoral dissertation is revealed by interpreting the place of this concept in the taxonomic structure of the Wikidata ontology. The expressiveness of Wikidata ontology for the description of doctoral dissertations is limited to three selected properties, authorship, doctoral advisor, and the institution to which the dissertation was submitted. The results of this study show on the one hand the redundancies in modelling doctoral dissertations, and on the other inconsistencies in the descriptions. This calls for close attention from libraries to metadata curatorial practices in Wikidata sociotechnical infrastructure. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - GLAM organisations have been exploring the benefits of publishing their digital collections in a wide variety of forms since the 2000s. Many institutions, and in particular libraries, have applied the Semantic Web and Linked Data to their main catalogues. Recent advances in technology and innovative approaches concerning the reuse of the digital collections by means of computational access have paved the way for the creation of laboratories within GLAM organisations. In this work, we present a framework that works in several steps to transform into linked open data (LOD), assess and enrich with external repositories the data sets made available by GLAM organisations under open licences. The framework has been applied to three metadata data sets made available by the Data Foundry at the National Library of Scotland obtaining as a result a collection of LOD repositories, a data quality assessment and examples of exploration. The results of this work are publicly available and can be applied to other domains such as digital humanities and data science. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Contemporary legal digital libraries such as Lexis Nexis and WestLaw allow users to search case laws using sophisticated search tools. The sophistication of these legal search tools, however, vary widely between commercial and non-commercial libraries, and by user groups. At its core, various forms of keyword search and indexing are used to find documents of interest. While newer search engines leveraging semantic technologies such as knowledgebases, natural language processing, and knowledge graphs are becoming available, legal databases are yet to take advantage of them fully. Even more scarce is any search engine able to support reasoning to identify legal documents based on legal precedent matching. In this paper, we introduce an experimental legal document search engine, called Prism, that is capable of supporting legal argument based search to support legal claims. We use a document engineering method to embed legal premise graphs, called the AND-OR graph, in the document to facilitate semantic match. A prototype implementation of Prism as a component of a document management system, called VOiC, is also discussed. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Widely employed digital archives of literary works are not necessarily neutral sources of knowledge, but rather literature ecosystems where the relevance of authors and works are shaped by communities of users. This could affect the visibility of authors belonging to historically marginalized groups of people, as it has been demonstrated by previous works on the under-representation of non-Western writers. In this work, we present an exploratory analysis on how divergent representations of works written by African and Asian writers emerge from different platforms. More specifically, we compare the reviews gathered from an Italian and an international social networks of readers, in order to highlight how authors from these continents are perceived by two different communities of users. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Model based design of building energy systems is increasingly used to enable efficient design flows. Different types of models have still to be converted manually, which is time consuming and error-prone. This turns out to be an obstacle for the integration of virtual validation by system simulations. As a contribution for automated conversion and translation of models, an ontology (MoOnt) has been developed that is utilized to represent Modelica simulation models as knowledge graphs (KG). An automated transcriptor that extracts KG from Modelica models has been implemented. A KG carrying the transcribed Modelica library and model representations was successfully queried for test cases. This is the basis towards further steps for automated translation of different types of models in the design process of buildings and a contribution to the model based design of building energy systems. © 2023, European Council on Computing in Construction (EC3).

AB  - The preservation digitization and revitalization of ancient books which carry the common memory of the Chinese nation is to continue the cultural lifeline of the Chinese nation. In recent years the rise of smart data has provided a new research perspective for the digitization and conservation of ancient books. This paper points out that smart data is a qualitative concept a rheological process and a polymorphic result. First of all it is difficult to have unified quantitative indicators for smart data and it needs to have suitable scenarios and specific periods to reflect the value of data. Secondly smart data is not static and with the increase of applications the increase of associations and the enhancement of content the value of smart data will also show dynamic characteristics. Finally smart data does not only contain a certain data form but forms a knowledge community by multiple data forms in the process of dynamic development. On the basis of smart data this paper proposes the concept and framework system of smart conservation of ancient books. The smart conservation takes smart data as the main form of expression and the implementation process is divided into semantic data linked data intelligent data and smart data. Among them semantic data can be regarded as the primary form of smart data intelligent data is the lightweight smart data which favors data dynamics and automation and smart data is the enhanced version of intelligent data which is more inclined to reproduce knowledge. Subsequently the paper points out that smart conservation is an intermediate form between regenerative conservation and heritage conservation of ancient books which provides a smarter and more intelligent knowledge source for heritage conservation of ancient books. Smart conservation requires the overall construction of the knowledge spectrum of ancient books which will contain multimodal data such as original ancient books images text audio and video knowledge forms such as metadata ontology entities relationships RDF data semantic enhancement contents such as entity links annotations knowledge and even intelligent data such as anticipation rules AR/VR knowledge graph as well as algorithms codes models etc. on which the smart generation depends. Finally this paper points out that smart conservation not only enriches the research scope and conservation methods of ancient books digitization but also implements the development concept of cultural heritage conservation. Further it may even promote the realization process of revitalization and utilization of ancient books. As the smart technology advances the content and scope of smart conservation will not be fixed and will continue to be improved. We hope that smart conservation can receive more recognition and attention. © 2023, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China. All rights reserved.

AB  - Batik is an Indonesian traditional craft that has high artistic value. Indonesian society, especially the younger generation such as students, plays an important role in preserving Indonesian culture such as batik to ensure it remains attached to Indonesia and does not disappear. However, the interest and enthusiasm of students in preserving batik is still lacking, so new strategies are needed to increase their interest and enthusiasm in preserving batik. One of the new strategies is utilizing immersive technology such as Mixed Reality (MR) with the implementation of gamification interaction to enhance students' interest because learning is done as if playing a game. MR technology can provide users with a more complex experience by using MR glasses. The Membatik application is a batik-making simulation application using MR technology where users can simulate with hand gestures and there are quizzes at each stage with a point system as a gamification implementation. The application has been tested with initial user testing. During the testing phase, users were asked to try the application and provide feedback on the overall user experience. The outcomes demonstrated that the MR application might raise students' interest in and involvement in their study. The users also found the quiz feature to be interactive and challenging, which added to their learning experience. By combining gamification elements with MR technology, the application has the potential to improve learning outcomes and increase student motivation.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The nature of libraries has changed rapidly with the advent of technology, so far as to change the very way of understanding the library itself. In this paper we examine the impact that digital technologies have had on library workers, and note that so far technology has only been used to transpose the standard library practices, and that little has been done to fully exploit the new opportunities it introduced. To overcome this situation, we propose a graph-based organization of DL data, based on a technology mixing DBs and ontologies. We also propose a holistic data schema allowing to store information that is usually neglected by traditional cataloging and description standards used in libraries. This would enable the use of AI techniques that may significantly expand the effectiveness of data processing and may dramatically improve the exploitation possibilities of documents. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Open Data can be freely used, created, and shared by anyone. However, initiatives to let K-12 learners exploit Open Data are rare in literature. To advance the dialogue around methods to increase awareness of Open Data and improve users’ skills to exploit and disseminate them, HETOR regularly organizes workshops with high-school learners to let them create, publish, and exploit Open Data by SPOD since 2017. This article reports on Data Exploitation and Dissemination activities proposed by HETOR and the observed results regarding the quantity and quality of produced outcomes. According to the discussion, learners successfully created value from Open Data authoring multimedia or data stories due to their active participation.

AB  - War archive is a quintessential big data issue about national history and military data security in urgent need of exploitation. Knowledge graph is one of the core technologies of knowledge engineering in the era of big data. With the ability of deep knowledge reasoning and progressively expanding cognition, knowledge graph has become a key technology for the construction and application in the field of military big data. Most of the existing knowledge graph is general knowledge graph for general fields, but there is no mature method of knowledge graph construction and application for the military archival big data. Taking the archival data of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea as an example, this paper, based on the special needs for military archive fields, explores the construction path of knowledge graph from the aspects of knowledge modeling, knowledge extraction, knowledge fusion and knowledge management. At the same time, the application of knowledge retrieval, archive resource linking, knowledge Q & A, knowledge recommendation and other scenarios are explored. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - The overall AI trend of creating neuro-symbolic systems is reflected in the Semantic Web community with an increased interest in the development of systems that rely on both Semantic Web resources and Machine Learning components (SWeMLS, for short). However, understanding trends and best practices in this rapidly growing field is hampered by a lack of standardized descriptions of these systems and an annotated corpus of such systems. To address these gaps, we leverage the results of a large-scale systematic mapping study collecting information about 470 SWeMLS papers and formalize these into one resource containing: (i) the SWeMLS ontology, (ii) the SWeMLS pattern library containing machine-actionable descriptions of 45 frequently occurring SWeMLS workflows, and (iii) SWEMLS-KG, a knowledge graph including machine-actionable metadata of the papers in terms of the SWeMLS ontology. This resource provides the first framework for semantically describing and organizing SWeMLS thus making a key impact in (1) understanding the status quo of the field based on the published paper corpus and (2) enticing the uptake of machine-processable system documentation in the SWeMLS area. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Purpose: In the last few years, the size of Linked Open Data (LOD) describing artworks, in general or domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs), is gradually increasing. This provides (art-)historians and Cultural Heritage professionals with a wealth of information to explore. Specifically, structured data about iconographical and iconological (icon) aspects, i.e. information about the subjects, concepts and meanings of artworks, are extremely valuable for the state-of-the-art of computational tools, e.g. content recognition through computer vision. Nevertheless, a data quality evaluation for art domains, fundamental for data reuse, is still missing. The purpose of this study is filling this gap with an overview of art-historical data quality in current KGs with a focus on the icon aspects. Design/methodology/approach: This study’s analyses are based on established KG evaluation methodologies, adapted to the domain by addressing requirements from art historians’ theories. The authors first select several KGs according to Semantic Web principles. Then, the authors evaluate (1) their structures’ suitability to describe icon information through quantitative and qualitative assessment and (2) their content, qualitatively assessed in terms of correctness and completeness. Findings: This study’s results reveal several issues on the current expression of icon information in KGs. The content evaluation shows that these domain-specific statements are generally correct but often not complete. The incompleteness is confirmed by the structure evaluation, which highlights the unsuitability of the KG schemas to describe icon information with the required granularity. Originality/value: The main contribution of this work is an overview of the actual landscape of the icon information expressed in LOD. Therefore, it is valuable to cultural institutions by providing them a first domain-specific data quality evaluation. Since this study’s results suggest that the selected domain information is underrepresented in Semantic Web datasets, the authors highlight the need for the creation and fostering of such information to provide a more thorough art-historical dimension to LOD. © 2023, Sofia Baroncini, Bruno Sartini, Marieke Van Erp, Francesca Tomasi and Aldo Gangemi.

AB  - In the music domain, several ontologies have been proposed to annotate musical data, in both symbolic and audio form, and generate semantically rich Music Knowledge Graphs. However, current models lack interoperability and are insufficient for representing music history and the cultural heritage context in which it was generated; risking the propagation of recency and cultural biases to downstream applications. In this article, we propose the Polifonia Ontology Network (PON) for music cultural heritage, centred around four modules: Music Meta (metadata), Representation (content), Source (provenance) and Instrument (cultural objects). We design PON with a strong accent on cultural stakeholder requirements and competency questions (CQs), contributing an NLP-based toolkit to support knowledge engineers in generating, validating, and analysing them; and a novel, high-quality CQ dataset produced as a result. We show current and future use of these resources by internal project pilots, early adopters in the music industry, and opportunities for the Semantic Web and Music Information Retrieval communities. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - This paper outlines ongoing research to standardize the metadata of letters from Finnish cultural heritage organizations to build a comprehensive archive for studying 19th-century epistolary culture in the Grand Duchy of Finland (1808/09-1917), as a part of the Constellations of Correspondence (CoCo) project. The challenge of deduplicating and reconciling actors and their associated information is an important problem faced in historical knowledge databases. The actors, e.g., senders and recipients of letters, can be individual people, couples, or families as well as organizations like institutions or companies. The deduplication described in this article has its focus on the individual people. The solutions we propose in this paper are significant for the development of the efficient and accurate approaches in this field. © 2023 Academic Conferences Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work aims at the conceptual and ontological modeling of the abstract spatial relations in heterogeneous cultural heritage data. This work focuses on built heritage, studying the case of Notre-Dame de Paris. The spatial information is a transversal component across the metadata and paradata collection in the datasets about Notre-Dame. The integration using spatial information is crucial for archival, query, analysis, and visualization. Cultural heritage data integration implies the use of the CIDOC CRM ontology, whereas the real-life data challenge the core model because of the complexity of spatial relations. This contribution aims at the analysis of this complexity in terms of mereological and topological spatial relations. It opens an opportunity to explore the conceptualization of space and the abstract spatial relations that go beyond the geometric or the geographic aspects. The contribution presents the conceptual and ontological modeling about the abstract spatial relations using both CIDOC CRM, its extension CRMgeo, geoSPARQL, and RCC8. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - In the last decade, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have increased their use as a tool to represent knowledge and query data. Some industrial solutions use KGs to allow the integration between the systems, to use artificial intelligence, or to facilitate communication between humans and the systems. DANKE is a platform developed by Tecgraf Institute at PUC-Rio University to support key searches over preprocessed and integrated data. It was configured and used for searching over data related to real-world operation and maintenance activities of an Oil and Gas production scenario. The Knowledge Graph of this system, called DOnG-KG (DANKE Oil and Gas - Knowledge Graph), is its core and allows searching and linking information from concepts collected from diverse data sources. However, it was developed under agile methodology, sacrificing some modeling decisions to empower performance. Moreover, it does not consider existing data models and core ontologies like ISO15926-part 14 for life-cycle data for process plants to guide the graph construction. This work proposed a refactoring of the DOnG-KG using well-known ontologies like SKOS, DC, OntoCape, ISO15926 part 2 (Reference Data Library), and part 14 (Upper Ontology) to define some concepts. We also extend the graph, including more concepts previously treated as data properties. In that way, the graph was adequate to an international semantics standard for life-cycle data for process plants, including Oil and Gas production facilities, allowing the inclusion and linking of new terms in the graph and different standards-subgraph for specific subdomains without inconsistency and ambiguity. Finally, the KG resulting from this work could be extended by plugging new sources and even used for other applications in the Oil and Gas context. © ICWI 2023.All rights reserved.

AB  - Aiming at the difficulty of information retrieval of massive electric power data and the difficulty of ordinary retrieval system to accurately return the answers required by users, this paper designs an intelligent Q&A system for electric power based on knowledge graph. According to the characteristics of user data, it is organised and stored as Q&A library, document library, mapping library and structured database, respectively, and the corresponding intelligent Q&A system is designed, which combines the classification results of complex problem understanding and intention recognition to complete the acquisition of answers and their sources. And based on the realisation of intelligent Q&A, the BERT model is added to improve the accuracy of the system response. We conducted experimental validation on the constructed electric power knowledge dataset, and the results show that the system can accurately understand user-input questions and give answers quickly and accurately. This system improves the efficiency of user information acquisition and effectively enhances the work efficiency of power grid practitioners. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Knowledge Graphs are often relying on conceptual models with a high level of abstraction, making them hard to understand for nonexpert users, and are often hidden behind search forms, losing the flexibility to interact with the graph as a graph. In order to leverage knowledge graphs there is a need to propose end-user-oriented interactions demonstrating how they can allow to discover a knowledge domain. Sparnatural was designed and developed as a visual, configurable, easily deployable, open-source, client-side SPARQL query builder, allowing users to query any RDF knowledge graph. We describe here how Sparnatural works, how it can be configured, and we show how it was deployed in two demonstrators for the Archives Nationales de France and Bibliothèque Nationale de France. We show how Sparnatural has made it possible to give access to nonexpert users, with little effort, to these two large graphs. Workshops conducted with end-users showed they were enthusiastic about the possibility offered. They also revealed that this novel search paradigm is surprising and could benefit from user onboarding. The configuration of Sparnatural is key in providing efficient access to the graph and can be done through the specification of a search-oriented ontology. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG. 2023.

AB  - In the process of software system evolution, software users constantly put forward a large number of expectations. For these expectations, software developers usually use the existing third-party libraries and other software resources to accelerate their development processes. At present, tons of third-party libraries are available. Therefore, appropriate recommendation methods are very important for developers to find suitable libraries for their development projects. In this paper, we present KG2Lib, a recommendation method to assist software developers in selecting suitable software libraries for their current projects. KG2Lib exploits a knowledge-graph-based convolutional network to recommend software libraries by relying on a set of libraries which were already called by current projects. The interaction matrix, weight matrix and knowledge graph are the inputs of KG2Lib. What’s more, KG2Lib recommends libraries to developers from project level and library level, which can better capture the fine-grained information to achieve better recommend performance. The performance of KG2Lib was evaluated on three datasets with four existing baseline models. The experimental results show that KG2Lib achieves better performance and helps software developers accurately select the appropriate third-party libraries. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper presents the implementation of a Linked Data Management System (LDMS) at the National Library Board Singapore (NLB), which aims to provide a unified view of bibliographic descriptions from diverse collections across the National Library, the Public Libraries, and the National Archives. The National Library Board worked with a vendor to convert metadata from multiple sources into entities in a triplestore for use in resource discovery. This paper will outline the challenges faced and lessons learnt in the production of Linked Data and improving data quality. The global pandemic forced the team to work remotely with an overseas vendor, which compounded the complexity of communicating relatively complex concepts and troubleshooting data issues. Great emphasis was placed on determining causes for data issues and correcting these. Challenges arose from the insertion of URIs into the source records to identify entities matching the string label as the reconciliation of entities extracted from different source systems is based on similarity of the name label and associated properties. The paper concludes with an outlook on the continuous refinement of data quality and the development of public interfaces to demonstrate the benefits of Linked Data to stakeholders. The development of this service inserts the discovery aspect directly into resources, demonstrating the potential of Linked Data to shape future services. © 2023 Dublin Core metadata initiative.

AB  - The value of power data credit reporting in the social credit system continues to increase, and the government, users and the whole society have deep expectations and support for power data credit reporting. This paper will combine the data labeling theory as the support, define the power data label and explain its labeling implementation. Based on the construction of knowledge graph, the method of labeling power data is introduced in detail: demand analysis method, index selection method, data cleaning method and data desensitization method. Use the sorted data labels to establish a label system for power data, and through its system, visualize the comprehensive situation of enterprise power data credit information to meet the development of power data credit business. This paper takes shell enterprises as the main representatives of credit risk enterprises, analyzes the power data in the three stages before and after loans, and builds a value mining model for power credit data. In the future, the data labeling technology and value mining model of the power data credit business will be comprehensively applied, and the power data label library and credit model library will be established and continuously improved, so as to facilitate the evaluation of the operation of the enterprise at different stages. © 2023, Strojarski Facultet.

AB  - Museums and cultural heritage institutions have an important role in presenting accurate information and sharing cultural knowledge, and new technologies are increasingly implemented. For the best results, the appropriateness of a specific technology must be evaluated for each context. Research has shown the need for participatory methods and local knowledge in Indigenous design contexts. We describe a case study where an Indigenous Sámi museum exhibition was augmented with interactive technology through multidisciplinary co-design work with museum experts, designers, and developers. The traditional clothing of the Sámi people was digitized by filming, and information related to it was presented as a touchscreen installation in a renewed exhibition. User tests including interactive tasks and interviews (n = 7) and a questionnaire (n = 27) were completed on-site. The installation was rated interesting and easy to use, while some users struggled to find all the features. Our study shows that a technically relatively simple digital installation can be easy-to-use but interesting for a standard museum visitor. Additionally, the work demonstrates how to build successful collaborations that highlight Indigenous cultural heritage. We discuss the implications of using technology to promote cultural heritage and identities. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Biomedical ontologies are a key component in many systems for the analysis of textual clinical data. They are employed to organize information about a certain domain relying on a hierarchy of different classes. Each class maps a concept to items in a terminology developed by domain experts. These mappings are then leveraged to organize the information extracted by Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to build knowledge graphs for inferences. The creation of these associations, however, requires extensive manual review. In this paper, we present an automated approach and repeatable framework to learn a mapping between ontology classes and terminology terms derived from vocabularies in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) metathesaurus. According to our evaluation, the proposed system achieves a performance close to humans and provides a substantial improvement over existing systems developed by the National Library of Medicine to assist researchers through this process. ©2023 AMIA - All rights reserved.

AB  - Knowledge graphs (KGs) are used in a wide variety of applications, including within the cultural heritage domain. An important prerequisite of such applications is the quality and completeness of the data. Using a single KG might not be enough to fulfill this requirement. The absence of connections between KGs complicates taking advantage of the complementary data they can provide. This paper focuses on the Wikidata and A rtG raph KGs, which exhibit gaps in content that can be filled by enriching one with data from the other. Entity alignment can help to combine data from KGs by connecting entities that refer to the same real-world entities. However, entity alignment in art-domain knowledge graphs remains under-explored. In the pursuit of entity alignment between A rtG raph and Wikidata, a hybrid approach is proposed. The first part, which we call WES (Wikidata Entity Search), utilizes traditional Wikidata SPARQL queries and is followed by a supplementary sequence-to-sequence large language model (LLM) pipeline that we denote as pArtLink. The combined approach successfully aligned artworks and artists, with WES identifying entities for 14,982 artworks and 2,029 artists, and pArtLink further aligning 76 additional artists, thus enhancing the alignment process beyond WES’ capabilities. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Modeling temporal information in cultural heritage knowledge graphs is essential to understand history, society and the world. However, due to the binary nature of RDF predicates, representing time in RDF is a challenge. This work addresses the challenge and explores various approaches for integrating time into knowledge graphs. In particular, the work aims at answering key research questions, such as best practices for temporal representation in RDF, crucial requirements in the cultural heritage context, and evaluating RDF extensions for modeling time. Additionally, it is investigated how RDF can reason over temporal relationships and how the new insights can be used to develop a lightweight and intuitive approach for modeling time in RDF based on domain requirements. Fundamentally, the research argues for embracing the persistence of temporality in KGs, as it is crucial for understanding our changing heritage, recognising the influence of the past on the present, and shaping a knowledgeable future. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - In China, traditional architecture has a profound cultural heritage. The variety of traditional Chinese architecture we see today was shaped by thousands of years of cultural accumulation and succession. The country's emphasis on the aspect of cultural inheritance has made people pay attention to the traditional architecture around them, but the public does not have the ability of experts to appreciate architecture, and it is more difficult for them to acquire the background knowledge of architecture. To enable people who are interested in architecture understand the relevant architectural art and history without having a high architectural literacy, this paper designs a Chinese traditional architecture science popularization system. Firstly, we adopted the literature analysis method to clarify the main types and key elements of traditional Chinese architecture. At the same time, the Neo4j was used to store and visualize the collected architectural knowledge. Then, the functions and structure of the architectural science popularization system are clarified through questionnaire survey and KANO model construction. A lightweight and efficient image recognition model is built by Create ML. Based on the Xcode development environment; we used Swift language to realize the human-computer interaction function of the system. In addition, this paper elaborates on the technical route, system framework and implementation process of the Chinese traditional architecture science popularization system in detail. 15 users have used the system for architecture recognition and the reliability of the system has been verified through interviews. Therefore, it can effectively provide professional knowledge of architecture science popularization for users, and provides a new way for the science popularization of traditional Chinese architecture. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This paper presents a methodology for semantic mapping from collection cataloging metadata to the Conceptual Reference Model by the International Committee for Documentation (CIDOC-CRM) and further creating an extension ontology called Ancient Chinese Artifacts Conceptual Reference Model (CRM-ACA). The approach is designed to suit the characteristics of ancient Chinese artifacts and can be effectively applied to other cultural heritage collections. By leveraging the semantic relationships based on a knowledge graph, the approach offers a search experience that is more nuanced and sophisticated for users. The benefits of this approach underscore the value of adopting standardized ontology as a basis for schema design, enabling potential information exchange and integration between heterogeneous digital resources. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The BookSampo Linked Data (LD) portal was deployed in 2011 by the Public Libraries of Finland and has today nearly 1.6 million annual users. Its large knowledge graph (KG) covers virtually all Finnish Fiction literature but has not been fully exploited in Digital Humanities. This paper discusses how the KG can be used for literary search, data exploration, and research by presenting a new BookSampo user interface (UI) based on faceted semantic search and browsing with seamlessly integrated data-analytic visualization tools. This application makes it possible for the first time to analyze the BookSampo data in versatile ways without programming skills. The analysis results presented suggest interesting spatial, temporal, and topical trends in how the Finnish fiction literature has evolved during the last decades. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - This paper focuses on exploring how art interpretation can be efficiently represented within the linked open data framework, according to two main scenarios. To do so, we first introduce ICON 2.0, a (lighter) extension of the iconographical and iconological artworks interpretations ontology (ICON) for the description of artwork subjects and meanings, and then we compare data encoded with the original (more complex) version with the extended version. ICON 2.0 introduces super-properties of chains to create shortcuts, enabling direct links between artworks and their respective first, second, and third level of interpretation subjects. By leveraging these super-properties, the extended ontology aims to streamline the process of connecting artworks with their associated subjects and cultural contexts. Throughout the study, we assess the benefits and shortcomings of using either ICON or ICON 2.0. We examine their potential impact on information retrieval, efficiency, and information loss, taking into consideration real-case scenarios of the integration of cultural heritage linked open data from current knowledge graphs. We show how the superproperty-based extension can be used to describe simple interpretations without information loss and avoiding redundant reifications, and how it can coexist with more complex descriptions by facilitating the retrieval of the subject matter. However, we also identify tradeoffs regarding the use of shortcuts in the conceptualisation of contrasting interpretations. The study concludes by providing valuable insights into the practical implications of these approaches for enriching the accessibility and depth of art interpretation in the linked open data ecosystem. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - (Extended Abstract) While most previous research focused only on the textual content of documents, advanced support for document management in Digital Libraries, for Open Science, requires handling all aspects of a document: from structure, to content, to context. These different but inter-related aspects cannot be handled separately, and were traditionally ignored in Digital Libraries. We propose a graph-based unifying representation and handling model based on the definition of an ontology that integrates all the different perspectives and drives the document description in order to boost the effectiveness of document management. We also show how even simple algorithms can profitably use our proposed approach to return relevant and personalized outcomes in different document management tasks. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Advances in photogrammetric surveys and immersive visualization through Virtual Reality (VR) have brought about a revolution in all areas of architectural representation. Architectural heritage has not escaped this revolution, since these techniques make possible the recovery of heritage elements that are currently missing or decontextualized, which otherwise would not be possible to contemplate. This article develops a paradigmatic case in this field such as the recovery of the Gothic choir of the Cathedral of Girona, completely dismantled and partially preserved in different locations of the Spanish geography. Based on previous work of recontextualization of similar environments carried out by the authors (Sánchez Riera et al., 2022a), this paper describes the construction of a virtual and hyperrealistic immersive model of the missing ensemble and its original context. The geometric and luminic integration of both models is shown in a self-de-veloped application and different scenes built by means of its use are exemplified. The proposal allows the interactive visualization of the complex by switching between its current and original states. The possibility of consulting additional information on certain singular elements, now disappeared or decontextualized, in the very location for which they were originally conceived, aims to promote their study and dissemination. It will also make it possible to establish hypotheses about their original design, use and configuration, ultimately promoting the conservation of architectural heritage that would otherwise remain forgotten. © 2023 University of L'Aquila, Department of Civil Construction, Building and Architecture, Environmental Engineering.

AB  - In today's data-driven world, data storage and information extraction are key processes where the focus of researchers and industries is centralized. While relational databases are widely used, knowledge graphs have emerged as a cutting-edge idea and have begun to compete with them as a result of utilization from renowned companies. Nevertheless, creating knowledge graphs is a time-consuming process that needs domain experts' support. This motivated us to research automatic or semi-automatic creation of knowledge graphs from structured or unstructured data. To do that and comprehend the newest advancements in this field, we have analyzed papers published in the recent five years in well-known libraries such as ACM, IEEE, Springer Link, and ScienceDirect. The analysis takes into account the process of building knowledge graphs, which encompasses the steps involved in managing unstructured texts, defining nodes and relationships between them, and developing ontologies. Moreover, widely used machine learning algorithms including support vector machines, neural networks, random forests, and logistic regression, and other algorithms such as K-Means, TF-IDF, BERT, and skip-gram, the usage of graph database platform Neo4j and Python scripting language, were considered. Conclusive to the study, there exist some semi-automatic approaches but the fully automatic ones remain as ideas. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - In recent years, massive multi-source heterogeneous South China Sea data have been widely used in the construction of South China Sea digital resources, such as the South China Sea Sovereign Evidence Chain Project. Due to the data sparsity, a large number of isolated data are generated, which seriously affects the analysis effect of the South China Sea Big Data. In this paper, we proposed a novel data association method. We collected data from the South China Sea Library Digital Resources as South China Sea evidence data, which is a sentence or paragraph containing time, place, people, institutions and events can prove the sovereignty of the South China Sea. According to the definition of the evidence weight by the International Court of Justice, the logical relationship of South China Sea evidence data was constructed. Firstly, we randomly selected 3068 data from 21174 evidence data to label the logical relationship. Secondly, we used the BERT pre-training model to extract the logical relationship of evidence data. Finally, the Knowledge Graph technology is used to retrieve and visualize the logical relationship of evidence data. In this paper, we applied the BERT to extract the logical relationships of evidence data with an accuracy of 0.78, which indicates that the model has some feasibility. This paper could help to improve the correlation of the South China Sea Big Data and to enhance the ability of data processing. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Nowadays, the cultural heritage wealth held within museums, archives, libraries, and heritage sites is under continuous threat due to various environmental, geopolitical, and resource factors. The need for proper preservation of such invaluable cultural assets worsens the risk of their loss and hinders global access to their knowledge. This paper describes our first steps towards preserving cultural heritage knowledge through intelligent digital services. Our work is conducted as part of the PNRR e.INS “Ecosystem of Innovation for Next Generation Sardinia” project, Spoke 6, which aims to support digital transformation in various domains, including cultural heritage, in the Sardinian region, Italy. The main objectives of this project include the digitization of cultural heritage knowledge by employing innovative solutions for a proper knowledge representation, the exploitation of such digital knowledge for proposing contextual and personalized services, and suitable user-friendly interfaces and applications that enable both operators and the general public to access, explore, and engage with such knowledge. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The high file weight in the models of cultural heritage digitised through scanning or photogrammetry makes it necessary to develop topological reduction strategies that allow maximum optimisation of these models for their use in environments such as virtual museums or any other form of interactive visualisation. With the focus on their accessibility, this work studies the efficiency of four computer applications used for 3D model remeshing. Using a methodology based on the observation of mesh attributes, a comparative analysis of their visualisation quality is made. The research is developed through a case study in which a model is obtained and verified using the UNITY®2022 1.18 videogame engine. As a result, a high visual quality is achieved with a significant improvement in viewing frequency of 55% on average over the original 3D model obtained by photogrammetry. © (2023), (Grupo Espanol International Institute for Conservation).

AB  - The application of the existing knowledge graph is widely concentrated in the civil fields with sufficient sample size and uniform distribution, especially in the Internet, finance and other fields. Due to the particularity of its application background in the military field, there is a general lack of sample size, which greatly limits the support ability of knowledge atlas technology for military intelligent applications. Therefore, how to solve the problem of automatic knowledge extraction of multimodal data under the condition of unbalanced samples is the key core problem that affects the application effect of knowledge perception technology in the military field. This topic focuses on the characteristics of small batch, multi batch, imbalance and diversity of data in the field of military operations, introduces the self-monitoring method based on deep learning, solves the problem of low accuracy of automatic knowledge extraction of unstructured data, solves the dependence of traditional intelligent extraction algorithm on sample size, carries out research on automatic construction technology of knowledge atlas, and constructs equipment type spectrum library. © 2023 Institute of Physics Publishing.

AB  - The Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS) was developed to describe bibliographic concepts and metadata and is maintained by the Library of Congress. Its authoritative version is given as an XML schema based on an XML mindset which means that it has significant limitations for use in a knowledge graphs context. We have therefore developed the Modular MODS Ontology (MMODS-O) which incorporates all elements and attributes of the MODS XML schema. In designing the ontology, we adopt the recent Modular Ontology Design Methodology (MOMo) with the intention to strike a balance between modularity and quality ontology design on the one hand, and conservative backward compatibility with MODS on the other. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - With the development of the Internet and advances in technology, financial transactions have become more convenient, but money laundering has also become more concealed, complex, and can be quickly adjusted according to regulatory policies, making traditional methods based on rule libraries and blacklists difficult to cope with the current Anti-Money Laundering (AML) challenges. To improve the efficiency and accuracy of AML work, various machine learning methods have been proposed. However, these methods are often difficult to be widely used due to their complex models and poor interpretability. To overcome the shortcomings of existing methods and adapt to the changing trends in money laundering while ensuring good interpretability, this paper proposes an AML method based on Hierarchical Risk Control Knowledge Graph (HRCKG). Firstly, a simulated AML dataset is generated based on a small amount of real data and money laundering patterns. Next, various transaction features are extracted to construct graded risk control indicators, which are used to automatically search for and filter risk control rules to form a rule library, and then construct an HRCKG. Finally, integrating rule-based reasoning and graph-based reasoning, this paper uses rule matching, node importance measurement, and community discovery algorithms to evaluate the money laundering risks of accounts, identify money laundering accounts, and discover money laundering groups. Through comparison with other machine learning methods and analysis of experimental results, the effectiveness and application value of the proposed method is demonstrated. © 2023 SPIE.

AB  - Evdoxus is a web information system for the management of the total ecosystem for the free provision of textbooks to the undergraduate students at the Greek Universities. Among its users are book publishers that register textbooks, faculty members that search for appropriate textbooks for their courses, administration of university departments that register the relevant textbooks for each module of the curricula (course), and finally, students that select one book per module that they attend. All the above information (except for which students selected which books) is freely available at the Evdoxus site in the form of HTML web pages. In this paper, we present how we extracted this information and converted it into an open Knowledge Graph in RDF that can be used to generate several interesting reports and answer statistical analysis questions in SPARQL. The KG is backed by a simple ontology which is aligned with some well-known ontologies. The extraction / conversion application has been developed using SWI-Prolog’s XPath and Semantic Web libraries. The KG encompasses the Linked Open Data initiative by linking University instances with their corresponding DBpedia entries, employing the Wikipedia search engine and the DBpedia SPARQL endpoint.

AB  - This paper describes the methodology followed and the lessons learned from employing crowdsourcing techniques as part of a homework assignment involving higher education students of computer science. Making use of a platform that supports crowdsourcing in the cultural heritage domain students were solicited to enrich the metadata associated with a selection of music tracks. The results of the campaign were further analyzed and exploited by students through the use of semantic web technologies. In total, 98 students participated in the campaign, contributing more than 6400 annotations concerning 854 tracks. The process also led to the creation of an openly available annotated dataset, which can be useful for machine learning models for music tagging. The campaign’s results and the comments gathered through an online survey enable us to draw some useful insights about the benefits and challenges of integrating crowdsourcing into computer science curricula and how this can enhance students’ engagement in the learning process. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2023.

AB  - With the growing attention from the public towards the preservation of famous historical and cultural towns and villages, there is an increasing demand for both technical aspects of preservation management and the demonstrative aspect of showcasing historical and cultural resources. Currently, knowledge of famous towns and villages is mainly obtained through independent information retrieval, resulting in low query efficiency and difficulties in uncovering hidden knowledge within these sites. To address these issues, we develop an intelligent question-answering system based on a knowledge graph for Chinese famous historical and cultural towns and villages. The question-answering system can effectively respond to user queries regarding the historical evolution, cultural characteristics, and preservation methods of famous towns and villages, providing a more convenient approach to the protection and inheritance of these cultural heritage sites.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The combination of Artificial Intelligence, Mixed Reality and other high-tech technologies with intangible cultural heritage provides innovative ideas for its inheritance and protection. However, in most intangible cultural heritage virtual reality systems, interaction is more important than knowledge, which brings many challenges to the carding and interactive experience of intangible cultural heritage. Therefore, taking the intangible cultural heritage of Hangluo as an example, we combined knowledge graphs and virtual reality to analyze and mine the data of Hangluo and constructed a relatively complete knowledge graph of Hangluo’s cultural resources. And the knowledge graphs were integrated into the virtual reality system to form a virtual interactive system of intangible cultural heritage with strong interaction and an emphasis on knowledge. The system has four modules: providing textile introduction display, textile pattern display, tools and craft display, and knowledge graph visualization. Finally, good test results were collected through the "Millennium Hangluo" experience class, which verified that the virtual interactive system for intangible cultural heritage based on knowledge graph had played a positive role in promoting the inheritance of intangible cultural heritage. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Background: There is a wide variety of potential sources from which insight into the antiquities trade could be culled, from newspaper articles to auction catalogues, to court dockets, to personal archives, if it could all be systematically examined. We explore the use of a large language model, GPT-3, to semi-automate the creation of a knowledge graph of a body of scholarship concerning the antiquities trade. Methods: We give GPT-3 a prompt guiding it to identify knowledge statements around the trade. Given GPT-3’s understanding of the statistical properties of language, our prompt teaches GPT-3 to append text to each article we feed it where the appended text summarizes the knowledge in the article. The summary is in the form of a list of subject, predicate, and object relationships, representing a knowledge graph. Previously we created such lists by manually annotating the source articles. We compare the result of this automatic process with a knowledge graph created from the same sources via hand. When such knowledge graphs are projected into a multi-dimensional embedding model using a neural network (via the Ampligraph open-source Python library), the relative positioning of entities implies the probability of a connection; the direction of the positioning implies the kind of connection. Thus, we can interrogate the embedding model to discover new probable relationships. The results can generate new insight about the antiquity trade, suggesting possible avenues of research. Results: We find that our semi-automatic approach to generating the knowledge graph in the first place produces comparable results to our hand-made version, but at an enormous savings of time and a possible expansion of the amount of materials we can consider. Conclusions: These results have implications for working with other kinds of archaeological knowledge in grey literature, reports, articles, and other venues via computational means.

AB  - The smart library is a development stage of library which is closely related to the development of new technology and its wide application in libraries. The standard system of library should evolve with the development of technology and business. Based on the existing standard system in the library field and adapting to the key business and technical requirements of smart library construction it is of great practical significance to construct a standard system for smart library construction which can standardize and guide the scientific development of the smart library. Based on the analysis of the existing library standard system and digital library standard system this study constructs a standard system framework of the smart library which is composed of basic standards technical standards resource standards service standards space standards and management standards by using artificial intelligence knowledge graph and smart city standard system for reference and combining with the construction content of the national smart library system proposed by the National Library of China. It briefly lists some specific standards that should be focused on and formulated. Basic standards mainly focus on some basic and universal requirements that should be followed in the construction of the smart library and provide consensus and norms for other standards such as the special terms and definitions of the smart library the reference model and the overall structure of the construction of the smart library. Technical standards mainly focus on providing key technical specifications for the application of intelligent technology in the construction and development of the smart library providing standards for the perception of the Internet of Things of the library and ensuring the interconnection and interoperation between intelligent hardware applications intelligent computing resources applications and different intelligent systems. Resource standards mainly focus on providing normative requirements for the creation organization management and preservation of knowledge resources of the library. Service standards mainly focus on providing specifications for specialized service scenarios or service modes resulting from the application of intelligent technologies to user services and at the same time adding smart aspects to other existing service standards according to the changes of technical means and methods of reader service. Space standards mainly provide the basis for the construction of new smart space using intelligent technologies. Management standards mainly focus on ensuring the safe and reliable operation scientific and sustainable development of the smart library which should include the standards of data management information security management intellectual property management and user management as well as the scientific evaluation of the construction of the smart library. This study also puts forward the construction strategy of this standard system such as highlighting on individuality and focusing on integration emphasizing on key points and urgent use priority dynamic update and so on. 6 figs. 38 refs. © 2023, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

AB  - The record-based approach to library information organization is obsolete and cannot support advanced opportunities provided by AI. Graph-based representations driven by ontologies are needed, but representation models proposed in this field are not compliant with those adopted by DBs. GraphBRAIN is a framework and technology that applies the ontological approach to the LPG model adopted by graph DBs, taking the best of both worlds: representational power and flexibility of ontologies and efficiency in data handling of DBs. It can be mapped onto the standard Semantic Web representations. The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) proposed different conceptual models of library data that move from record-based to relational representations, but do not reach the ontological level. Conversely, attempts to tackle the ontological level are often not fully compliant with the IFLA models. This paper reports on developing an ontology based on GraphBRAIN technology that aligns the various models proposed by IFLA, fully representing their elements. It shows how it can be expanded to include elements that are not traditionally represented in library models, but that can unleash new potentiality for library practitioners, researchers and end-users. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Power production safety hidden danger data is difficult to accurately identify, which leads to the inability to predict and prevent potential safety hazards. Moreover, the format of relevant laws and safety regulations in the power industry is different, and the original text information cannot be directly used for processing and analysis. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a preprocessing method for power production safety-related text information fusion cleaning. This paper proposes a feature mining method for power production safety hidden danger based on wavelet multi-window spectrum extraction.The crawling technology is used to crawl non-structured hidden danger data in the power production safety system, and NLP segmentation system is used to segment hidden danger texts. A database model is constructed to establish a high-quality sample data set with minimal cost and minimal sample deviation. The rough concept lattice generation algorithm is used for frequent access feature partitioning of data streams. And then, by constructing the wavelet function, the hyperbolic frequency mother wavelet of the hidden danger feature library of power production is obtained. The multi-window spectrum features of the database information flow are extracted to achieve feature mining of power production safety hidden dangers. Simulation results show that this method can effectively reflect the information characteristics of power safety hazard data and provide a basis for subsequent knowledge graph construction.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Ethnic minority clothing is a part of the culture of Chinese nationality clothing which plays an extremely important role in representing the essence of ethnic minority culture recording the development process of ethnic minority culture and encouraging intercultural communication between ethnic minorities and others. Conducting scientific research on ethnic minority clothing is a crucial approach to inherit and innovate traditional ethnic minority culture. There have been huge amounts of meaningful and inspired academic achievements published by those intelligent creative researchers and practitioners regarding ethnic minority clothing since the founding of People s Republic of China in 1949. Classifying and analyzing these academic results could help us to reveal and have better insights of the development process and research status of ethnic minority costumes in China which is also of positive significance for promoting the construction of disciplines in relevant fields. This study takes the papers related to ethnic minority clothing research included in CNKI as the research object takes the time of the first paper included in the database as the starting point and uses CiteSpace as the research tool to conduct word frequency statistics co-word analysis cluster analysis and theme analysis on 2 552 academic research results including 1 439 academic journal papers 31 conference papers 1 040 dissertations and 42 newspaper articles between 1955 and 2022 through bibliometric methods and constructs a visual knowledge graph as a result. This study demonstrates the research situation research content institutional distribution and research groups of ethnic minority clothing research in China for the past 68 years and summarizes the general and common characteristics of ethnic minority clothing research which helps to cultivate and improve academic communication and dialogue among different disciplines in this specific field. It is found that ethnic minority clothing research has gone through a preliminary period (1955 - 1979) a slow growth period (1980 - 1999) a rapid development period (2000 - 2019) and a fluctuating adjustment period (2020 - 2021) . With the efforts of scholars four major research themes of innovative design contemporary application cultural and historical research and exhibition research have been formed in the field of ethnic minority clothing involving many disciplines such as anthropology ethnology archaeology literature art aesthetics design political science light industry and textile and sports. Many representative research institutions and research scholars have emerged one after another especially in ethnic minority areas where academic activity is high. It is also found that the clothes of 13 ethnic minorities namely Miao Mongolian Manchu Korean Tujia Yi She Uyghur Hezhen Tibetan Li Hani and Dong have received much higher attention from researchers. However this analysis also exposes there are weak collaborative relationships between minority clothing research institutions and scholars few interdisciplinary studies and a low proportion of high-quality academic research results. The academic community should further elaborate and define the concept of ethnic minority clothing take both technological innovation and cultural heritage into consideration pay attention to the perspective of ethnic minority clothing wearers and find a sustainable development direction for ethnic minority clothing from the laws of cultural integration and cultural change. Scholars with different ethnic identities need to engage in more in-depth conversation and scholars from different institutions and specialties should enhance scientific collaboration to improve the overall level of ethnic minority clothing research. Inevitably there are still some limitations in this study such as the lack of collection collation and analysis of domestic ethnic minority clothing books and overseas literature and the research sample can be further expanded in these aspects in the future to obtain more comprehensive and in-depth research findings. © Journal of Silk.

AB  - Cultural heritage (CH) contents are typically strongly interlinked, but published in heterogeneous, distributed local data silos, making it difficult to utilize the data on a global level. Furthermore, the content is usually available only for humans to read, and not as data for Digital Humanities (DH) analyses and application development. This application report addresses these problems by presenting a collaborative publication model for CH Linked Data and six design principles for creating shared data services and semantic portals for DH research and applications. This Sampo model has evolved gradually in 2002-2021 through lessons learned when developing the Sampo series of linked data services and semantic portals in use, including MuseumFinland (2004), CultureSampo (2009), BookSampo (2011), WarSampo (2015), Norssit Alumni (2017), U.S. Congress Prosopographer (2018), NameSampo (2019), BiographySampo (2019), WarVictimSampo 1914-1922 (2019), MMM (2020), AcademySampo (2021), FindSampo (2021), WarMemoirSampo (2021), and LetterSampo (2022). These Semantic Web applications surveyed in this paper cover a wide range of application domains in CH and have attracted up to millions of users on the Semantic Web, suggesting feasibility of the proposed Sampo model. This work shows a shift of focus in research on CH semantic portals from data aggregation and exploration systems (1. generation systems) to systems supporting DH research (2. generation systems) with data analytic tools, and finally to automatic knowledge discovery and Artificial Intelligence (3. generation systems).  © 2023-The authors.

AB  - Last years witnessed a shift from the potential utility in digitisation to a crucial need to enjoy activities virtually. In fact, before 2019, data curators recognised the utility of performing data digitisation, while during the lockdown caused by the COVID-19, investing in virtual and remote activities to make culture survive became crucial as no one could enjoy Cultural Heritage in person. The Cultural Heritage community heavily invested in digitisation campaigns, mainly modelling data as Knowledge Graphs by becoming one of the most successful Semantic Web technologies application domains. Despite the vast investment in Cultural Heritage Knowledge Graphs, the syntactic complexity of RDF query languages, e.g., SPARQL, negatively affects and threatens data exploitation, risking leaving this enormous potential untapped. Thus, we aim to support the Cultural Heritage community (and everyone interested in Cultural Heritage) in querying Knowledge Graphs without requiring technical competencies in Semantic Web technologies. We propose an engaging exploitation tool accessible to all without losing sight of developers' technological challenges. Engagement is achieved by letting the Cultural Heritage community leave the passive position of the visitor and actively create their Virtual Assistant extensions to exploit proprietary or public Knowledge Graphs in question-answering. By accessible to all, we mean that the proposed software framework is freely available on GitHub and Zenodo with an open-source license. We do not lose sight of developers' technical challenges, which are carefully considered in the design and evaluation phases. This article first analyses the effort invested in publishing Cultural Heritage Knowledge Graphs to quantify data developers can rely on in designing and implementing data exploitation tools in this domain. Moreover, we point out challenges developers may face in exploiting them in automatic approaches. Second, it presents a domain-agnostic Knowledge Graph exploitation approach based on virtual assistants as they naturally enable question-answering features where users formulate questions in natural language directly by their smartphones. Then, we discuss the design and implementation of this approach within an automatic community-shared software framework (a.k.a. generator) of virtual assistant extensions and its evaluation in terms of performance and perceived utility according to end-users. Finally, according to a taxonomy of the Cultural Heritage field, we present a use case for each category to show the applicability of the proposed approach in the Cultural Heritage domain. In overviewing our analysis and the proposed approach, we point out challenges that a developer may face in designing virtual assistant extensions to query Knowledge Graphs, and we show the effect of these challenges in practice. © 2023-The authors.

AB  - EarthQA is a question answering engine that accepts questions in natural language (English) that ask for satellite images satisfying certain criteria and returns links to such datasets, that can be then downloaded from the CREODIAS cloud platform. The questions can refer to image metadata (e.g., satellite platform, sensing period, cloud cover etc.) but also to entities from the knowledge graph DB-pedia (e.g., Mount Etna or the city of Munich). In this way, the users can ask questions like "Give me Sentinel-2 satellite images that show Mount Etna, have been taken in February 2021 and have cloud cover less than 10%." © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The dynamicity of semantic data has propelled the research on RDF Archiving, i.e., the task of storing and making the full history of large RDF datasets accessible. However, existing archiving techniques fail to scale when confronted with very large RDF datasets and support only simple SPARQL queries. In this demonstration, we therefore showcase GLENDA, a system that can run full SPARQL 1.1 compliant queries over large RDF archives. We achieve this through a multi-snapshot change-based storage architecture that we interface using the Comunica query engine. Thanks to this integration we demonstrate that fast SPARQL query processing over multiple versions of a knowledge graph is possible. Moreover, our demonstration provides different statistics about the history of RDF datasets that can be useful for tasks beyond querying and by providing insights about the evolution dynamics of the data. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG. 2023.

AB  - Among the current challenges related to the digital preservation of heritage is the adoption of metadata normalization and standardization processes. This article discusses some challenges related to the digital preservation and dissemination of Mexico’s cultural heritage in the project Mexicana, el repositorio del patrimonio cultural de México (Mexicana, the repository of Mexico's cultural heritage), four years after its publication. From this discussion and the comparison of the data processing of an emblematic Mexican object, the Piedra de Sol, we show the positive consequences of adopting specific standardization processes and of proposing a strategy of interoperability between repositories, as well as the results of standardization with metadata schemas. Some recommendations are also made to consolidate a future digital preservation program for Mexico’s cultural heritage, which should be agreed upon by researchers, administrators, institution managers, and other agents in the cultural sphere. © 2023 Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.

AB  - In this work, we propose an alternative approach for constructing temporal social networks from diachronic documents by leveraging both graph and textual information. Our framework utilizes a randomized relation extraction model to extract interpersonal relationships among people from long-form documents and then enhances the extracted social network through inference on a temporal knowledge graph. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through experiments on two datasets, including a politician's diary and a newspaper archive, and it has potential applications in various interdisciplinary fields such as computational politics and computational history.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - In recent years, computer technology has advanced significantly and more and more museums have begun to prioritize digital protection of cultural relics, achieving fruitful results. However, the digital resources of these relics are often stored in document or relational database forms, and displayed on the museum website using basic division methods. Moreover, each cultural relic collection holds its own unique knowledge points and there must be rich associations between them due to certain commonalities, which cannot be fully applied by existing preservation techniques. Multi-modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKG) have undergone years of development and have achieved significant results and widespread applications. Although China has abundant multi-modal data on cultural relics, there is limited exploration of MMKG in the field of cultural relics. Therefore, this paper proposes to construct a MMKG for museum relics, RelicMMKG, to mine the information contained in the multimodal digital resources of museum relics. This includes using the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model to identify multiple types of entities in the relic text introduction and using image descriptors to extract and calculate the similarity of visual features in the relic image data. Furthermore, based on the RelicMMKG and structured text and image data, a multifunctional application system is implemented to better explore the correlation between cultural relics, enabling efficient excavation and application of cultural relics data in the museum.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Appearing traces of bias in deep networks is a serious reliability issue which can play a significant role in ethics and generalization related concerns. Recent studies report that the deep features extracted from the histopathology images of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the largest publicly available archive, are surprisingly able to accurately classify the whole slide images (WSIs) based on their acquisition site while these features are extracted to primarily discriminate cancer types. This is clear evidence that the utilized Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) unexpectedly detect the specific patterns of the source site, i.e, the hospital of origin, rather than histomorphologic patterns, a biased behavior resulting in degraded trust and generalization. This observation motivated us to propose a method to alleviate the destructive impact of hospital bias through a novel feature selection process. To this effect, we have proposed an evolutionary strategy to select a small set of optimal features to not only accurately represent the histological patterns of tissue samples but also to eliminate the features contributing to internal bias toward the institution. The defined objective function for an optimal subset selection of features is to minimize the accuracy of the model to classify the source institutions which is basically defined as a bias indicator. By the conducted experiments, the selected features extracted by the state-of-the-art network trained on TCGA images (i.e., the KimiaNet), considerably decreased the institutional bias, while improving the quality of features to discriminate the cancer types. In addition, the selected features could significantly improve the results of external validation compared to the entire set of features which has been negatively affected by bias. The proposed scheme is a model-independent approach which can be employed when it is possible to define a bias indicator as a participating objective in a feature selection process; even with unknown bias sources. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a core technology to aggregate and publish knowledge on the Web. However, integrating knowledge from different sources, not specifically designed to be interoperable, is not a trivial task. Finding the right ontologies to model a dataset is a challenge since several valid data models exist and there is no clear agreement between them. In this paper, we propose to facilitate the selection of a data model with the RICDaM (Recommending Interoperable and Consistent Data Models) framework. RICDaM generates and ranks candidates that match entity types and properties in an input dataset. These candidates are obtained by aggregating freely available domain RDF datasets in a knowledge graph and then enriching the relationships between the graph's entities. The entity type and object property candidates are obtained by exploiting the instances and structure of this knowledge graph to compute a score that considers both the accuracy and interoperability of the candidates. Datatype properties are predicted with a random forest model, trained on the knowledge graph properties and their values, so to make predictions on candidate properties and rank them according to different measures. We present experiments using multiple datasets from the library domain as a use case and show that our methodology can produce meaningful candidate data models, adaptable to specific scenarios and needs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Advances in the digitalisation of data have led to large archives of content in media companies. These archives include multimodal data and metadata associated with each media programme. Relating content across different mediums of data and metadata has thus become an emergent challenge, with applications to popular domains such as programme recommendation. In this paper, we worked with combinations of content similarity measures computed from the distances between different forms of textual data obtained from subtitle files and metadata obtained from the genres of programmes. The different forms of textual representations we considered were neural semantic and topic vectors, and a weighted Jaccard distance encoding lexical token rareness. The late fusion combination of these four distances provided the best recommendation results. For a weekly dataset of 145 TV programmes, it increased the precision of the genre-based recommendations by 5.76%. In a monthly dataset of 906 programmes, it achieved an increase of 1.5%. This combination was more efficient than one with audio and video files.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - In recent years, educational institutions have worked hard to automate their work using more trending technologies that prove the success in supporting decision-making processes. Most of the decisions in educational institutions rely on rating the academic research profiles of their staff. An enormous amount of scholarly data is produced continuously by online libraries that contain data about publications, citations, and research activities. This kind of data can change the accuracy of the academic decisions, if linked with the local data of universities. The linked data technique in this study is applied to generate a link between university semantic data and a scientific knowledge graph, to enrich the local data and improve academic decisions. As a proof of concept, a case study was conducted to allocate the best academic staff to teach a course regarding their profile, including research records. Further, the resulting data are available to be reused in the future for different purposes in the academic domain. Finally, we compared the results of this link with previous work, as evidence of the accuracy of leveraging this technology to improve decisions within universities. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Semantic web technologies are rapidly changing digital humanities research. Over the last decades, an immense amount of new qualitative data have been accumulated and made available in interchangeable formats, in social sciences and humanities, opening new possibilities for solving old questions and posing new ones. Archiving, storing, linking, and reviewing data from several different sites, called semantical inclusion, is one of the biggest challenges for digital humanities research. Semantic integration is a mechanism by which the data, along with their associations and ontology, are conceptually interpreted to remove potential heterogeneity. For interface design, Ontologies may be used to map and merge metadata from various sources. This paper introduces a framework that eases scholars' access to historical and cultural data about the local wisdom and customs in the Northeast of Thailand that are distributed across different data sources. This paper aims to discuss metadata and ontology in semantical incorporation of Thai culture research from different datasets. "Heet Sib Song", a traditional twelvemonth festival well-known in northeastern Thailand, is the regional Thai culture this study is concerned with. As a computational representation of the Heet Sib Song domain, we use Ontology Development 101 to provide semanticized metadata aggregation from the various databases. In further research, we will use the resulting ontology to create a semantic search system that can be used in the future. The digital content management method will be used in combination with the cultural heritage database system of the Digital Humanities Research Group, Khon Kaen University. © 2022 Seorim.

AB  - Libraries expand the access and visibility of data and research in support of an informed public. Search engines have limited knowledge of the dynamic nature of libraries - their people, their services, and their resources. The very definition of libraries in online environments is outdated and misleading. This article offers a solution to this metadata problem by redefining libraries for Machine Learning environments and search engines. Two ways to approach this problem include implementing local structured data in a knowledge graph model and 'inside-out' definitions in Semantic Web endpoints. MSU Library has found that implementing a 'Knowledge Graph' linked data model leads to improved discovery and interpretation by the bots and search engines that index and describe what libraries are, what they do, and their scholarly content. In contrast, LSE Library has found that contributing to Wikidata, a collaborative and global metadata source, can increase understanding of libraries and extend their reach and engagement. This article demonstrates that Wikidata can be used to push out data, the technical details of knowledge graph markup, and the practice of semantic Search Engine Optimization (SEO). It explores how metadata can represent an organization equitably and how this improves the reach of global information communities.  © 2022 - The authors. Published by IOS Press.

AB  - In cultural heritage, many projects execute Named Entity Linking (NEL) through global Linked Open Data (LOD) references in order to identify and disambiguate entities in their local datasets. It allows users to obtain extra information and contextualise the data with it. Thus, the aggregation and integration of heterogeneous LOD are expected. However, such development is still limited partly due to data quality issues. In addition, analysis on the LOD quality has not sufficiently been conducted for cultural heritage. Moreover, most research on data quality concentrates on ontology and corpus level observations. This paper examines the quality of the eleven major LOD sources used for NEL in cultural heritage with an emphasis on instance-level connectivity and graph traversals. Standardised linking properties are inspected for 100 instances/entities in order to create traversal route maps. Other properties are also assessed for quantity and quality. The outcomes suggest that the LOD is not fully interconnected and centrally condensed; the quantity and quality are unbalanced. Therefore, they cast doubt on the possibility of automatically identifying, accessing, and integrating known and unknown datasets. This implies the need for LOD improvement, as well as the NEL strategies to maximise the data integration. © 2023-The authors. Published by IOS Press.

AB  - Graph-like structures, which are increasingly popular in data representation, stand out since they enable the integration of information from multiple sources. At the same time, clustering algorithms applied on graphs allow for group entities based on similar characteristics, and discover statistically important information. This paper aims to explore the associations between the visual objects of the Renaissance in the Europeana database, based on the results of topic modeling and analysis. For this purpose, we employ Europeana’s Search and Report API to investigate the relations between the visual objects from this era, spanning from the 14th to the 17th century, and to create clusters of similar art objects. This approach will lead in transforming a cultural heritage database with semantic technologies into a dynamic digital knowledge representation graph that will relate art objects and their attributes. Based on associations between metadata, we will conduct a statistic analysis utilizing the knowledge graph of Europeana and topic modeling analysis. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Because of the growth of the business sector dealing in the distribution of movies, software, music, and other contents, a very large amount of contents has accumulated. Accordingly, recommendation systems for inducing user requests for contents are more important. In distribution businesses, accurate content recommendations are required to secure and retain users. To establish a highly accurate recommendation system, the recommended contents must be accurately classified. As classification methods, mainly techniques such as naive Bayes, SGD (stochastic gradient descent), and SVM (support vector machine), are utilized. If all of the information on recommended subjects is applied in the classification process, high-level accuracy can be expected, but heavy calculation, a long service time, and low scalability are incurred. Given this inefficiency, effective classification in which the metadata of contents are used is required. Metadata are expressed in the forms of the domain concept, relation, type, and attribute to allow the complicated relations between multimodal data (text, images, and video) to be processed efficiently. Most classification systems use single modal data to express one piece of knowledge for an item in a domain. Single modal data are limited in terms of improving classification accuracy, because they do not include the useful information provided by different knowledge types. Therefore, in this paper, we propose MMCNet, a deep learning–based multimodal classification model that uses dynamic knowledge. The proposed method consists of a classification model that applies the human learning principle-based CNN (convolution neural network) to multimodal data in combination with text and image knowledge. By using a Web robot agent, multimodal data are collected from the TMDb (The Movie Database) data set, which includes a variety of single modal data. In the preprocessing procedures, knowledge integration, knowledge conversion, and knowledge reduction are performed to create a quantified knowledge base. To handle text data, sentences are refined through morphological analysis and converted to numerical vectors by using word embedding. Image data are converted to numerical vectors using the library related to vector conversion. The converted feature vectors are utilized to create multimodal learning data and the classification model is used for learning. To solve the problem of memory operation resources, vector model-based meta-knowledge is expanded through expression, conversion, alignment, inference, and deep learning. To evaluate its performance, the proposed model was compared with conventional classification methods in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-score. According to this evaluation, the proposed classification model improves the accuracy, recall, and F1-score rates more than the conventional methods. In addition, the proposed model was implemented as a deep learning–based multimodal classification system in a graphical user interface environment that allows users to provide feedback about the classification results by adjusting classification parameters. Through the convergence of the knowledge bases of various domains and multimodal deep learning, the dynamic knowledge that influences user preference is inferred. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - With the implementation of the national cultural digitization strategy GLAMs has extracted a large amount of standardized and structured knowledge from resources and data. Some knowledge data comes from newspapers old photos books celebrity files maps videos etc. Data resources include the results of metadata description OCR recognition named entity recognition and keyword tagging of digital resources. Data types include different formats such as image data text-based unstructured and semi-structured data structured data and semantic data showing the characteristics of multi-source heterogeneity and multi¬modality. These multimodal data are used in fields such as resource promotion knowledge dissemination and innovative services. Based on these multimodal cultural heritage resources the interaction and virtual space constructed by digital technology are integrated to form a new “media language” and a new “narrative language”. This article takes the “Cultural Chronicle” exhibition item of the Shanghai Library as an example, and uses event-driven interactive data visualization design to help promote cultural heritage resources and spread urban culture. These data are multiple data sets that have been carefully processed and fine-grained indexed by professional librarians from resources and data of various types sources and formats and are organized and coded by semantic technology. Such a data set not only serves as a knowledge base for readers to consult, but also serves as a data snapshot of Shanghai’s historical and cultural development process, reflecting the details and overall picture of the city, s historical and cultural development from all aspects. The innovation of this paper is that the “Cultural Chronicle" exhibition item is based on the multimodal cultural heritage resources in the “data infrastructure" oriented to humanities research, embodies the development and evolution of Shanghai, s history and culture as a luxuriant tree of life, and displays Shanghai with six cultural dynasties. From germination to early formation from transformation to resistance modern culture has a new development process together with the birth of new China. Different from the traditional linear timeline it highlights the interrelationships of important figures social groups and landmarks in the development of modern Shanghai culture and reveals how celebrities from different life backgrounds and cultural fields communicate and connect. Intertwined and connected like lush branches it presents the flourishing Shanghai style culture. As a new model of “digital storytelling", “data storytelling“ can break the traditional single and linear narrative logic establish an interactive context with users and help users obtain the hidden meanings in large-scale data in the process of continuous interaction. Discover new links and encounter new knowledge in fragmented data. Based on the framework of data storytelling using data as a carrier the cultural value behind the event is deeply excavated so that research sources hidden information clear reasoning and visualization-based results can be displayed and shared, triggering the audience, s thinking about history and vision of the future. 4 figs. 34 refs. © 2023, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

AB  - There are several ways to publish data on the web, from plain or GitHub web pages, to linked open data, and online catalogs. However, since each data owner can select a different way to publish his data, it is challenging to discover all the available datasets that are represented through a particular ontology O. The rationale for building a catalog for datasets expressed with respect to a particular ontology O (or specializations of O), is that the community which is interested in that ontology has various incentives to publish its datasets in such a catalog: for inspecting the use of the ontology (for spotting errors and/or for guiding the use and evolution of the ontology), for finding other datasets that could be easily integrated, and others. In this paper we focus on such catalogs, and in particular we showcase a catalog for datasets expressed with respect to CIDOC-CRM. Even if there are dozens of datasets that are represented using CIDOC-CRM, there is not any online resource that contains even a simple textual list of all these datasets. To fill this gap, we present an interactive portal that contains ontology-based descriptions for 30 CIDOC-CRM datasets. Through this portal, the user can browse all CIDOC-CRM datasets (and their statistics), can find all datasets that use a particular CIDOC-CRM property/class, can see the most frequent properties and classes, can check the commonalities between different datasets, and can enrich the catalog with new datasets. Finally, we provide indicative measurements over the 30 collected CIDOC-CRM datasets and for the properties/classes of the current version of CIDOC-CRM. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The latest Deep Learning (DL) models for detection and classification have achieved an unprecedented performance over classical machine learning algorithms. However, DL models are black-box methods hard to debug, interpret, and certify. DL alone cannot provide explanations that can be validated by a non technical audience such as end-users or domain experts. In contrast, symbolic AI systems that convert concepts into rules or symbols – such as knowledge graphs – are easier to explain. However, they present lower generalization and scaling capabilities. A very important challenge is to fuse DL representations with expert knowledge. One way to address this challenge, as well as the performance-explainability trade-off is by leveraging the best of both streams without obviating domain expert knowledge. In this paper, we tackle such problem by considering the symbolic knowledge is expressed in form of a domain expert knowledge graph. We present the eXplainable Neural-symbolic learning (X-NeSyL) methodology, designed to learn both symbolic and deep representations, together with an explainability metric to assess the level of alignment of machine and human expert explanations. The ultimate objective is to fuse DL representations with expert domain knowledge during the learning process so it serves as a sound basis for explainability. In particular, X-NeSyL methodology involves the concrete use of two notions of explanation, both at inference and training time respectively: (1) EXPLANet: Expert-aligned eXplainable Part-based cLAssifier NETwork Architecture, a compositional convolutional neural network that makes use of symbolic representations, and (2) SHAP-Backprop, an explainable AI-informed training procedure that corrects and guides the DL process to align with such symbolic representations in form of knowledge graphs. We showcase X-NeSyL methodology using MonuMAI dataset for monument facade image classification, and demonstrate that with our approach, it is possible to improve explainability at the same time as performance. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Bin picking based on deep learning techniques is a promising approach that can solve several analytical methods problems. These systems can provide accurate solutions to bin picking in cluttered environments, where the scenario is always changing. This article proposes a robust and accurate system for segmenting bin picking objects, employing an easy configuration procedure to adjust the framework according to a specific object. The framework is implemented in Robot Operating System (ROS) and is divided into a detection and segmentation system. The detection system employs Mask R-CNN instance neural network to identify several objects from two dimensions (2D) grayscale images. The segmentation system relies on the point cloud library (PCL), manipulating 3D point cloud data according to the detection results to select particular points of the original point cloud, generating a partial point cloud result. Furthermore, to complete the bin picking system a pose estimation approach based on matching algorithms is employed, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP). The system was evaluated for two types of objects, knee tube, and triangular wall support, in cluttered environments. It displayed an average precision of 79% for both models, an average recall of 92%, and an average IOU of 89%. As exhibited throughout the article, this system demonstrates high accuracy in cluttered environments with several occlusions for different types of objects. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Cultural heritage institutions have recently started to share their metadata as Linked Open Data (LOD) in order to disseminate and enrich them. The publication of large bibliographic data sets as LOD is a challenge that requires the design and implementation of custom methods for the transformation, management, querying and enrichment of the data. In this report, the methodology defined by previous research for the evaluation of the quality of LOD is analysed and adapted to the specific case of Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples containing standard bibliographic information. The specified quality measures are reported in the case of four highly relevant libraries. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Linked Open Data (LOD) was designed to respect heterogeneity in source datasets. However, the fundamental mechanisms of interlinking require sameness without nuance, so Linked Data is at risk of the problems associated with lack of diversity in big data generally. This article investigates the tension between difference and sameness specifically as it relates to asserting the identity of entities. It links ambiguity in natural language and cultural expression to Derrida’s notion of différance and the foundation of Linked Data structure in Peircian semiotics. Representing entities so as to foreground rather than suppress subtle differences or ambiguity is a challenge given the lack of anything in between owl:sameAs and owl:differentFrom that can be supported by formal logic. The reuse of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) recommended as a best practice for data interlinking is troubled by confusion over the relationship between URIs and representation, whereas owl:sameAs suffers from a range of forms of misuse. Despite these challenges to representing nuance and ambiguity, however, there are several ways in which humanities researchers and cultural institutions can pursue better means of representing diversity and difference using LOD, particularly through interdisciplinary and multisectoral collaboration. © Susan Brown 2022.

AB  - There is an increasing number of projects based on Knowledge Graphs and SPARQL endpoints. These SPARQL endpoints are later queried by final users or used to feed many different kinds of applications. Shape languages, such as ShEx and SHACL, have emerged to guide the evolution of these graphs and to validate their expected topology. However, authoring shapes for an existing knowledge graph is a time-consuming task. The task gets more challenging when dealing with sources, possibly maintained by heterogeneous agents. In this paper, we present sheXer, a system that extracts shapes by mining the graph structure. We offer sheXer as a free Python library capable of producing both ShEx and SHACL content. Compared to other automatic shape extractors, sheXer includes some novel features such as shape inter-linkage and computation of big real-world datasets. We analyze the features and limitations w.r.t. performance with different experiments using the English chapter of DBpedia. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Here we study the semantic search and retrieval problem in biomedical digital libraries. First, we introduce MedGraph, a knowledge graph embedding-based method that provides semantic relevance retrieval and ranking for the biomedical literature indexed in PubMed. Second, we evaluate our approach using PubMed's Best Match algorithm. Moreover, we compare our method MedGraph to a traditional TF-IDF-based algorithm. Third, we use a dataset extracted from PubMed, including 30 million articles' metadata such as abstracts, author information, citation information, and extracted biological entity mentions. We pull a subset of the dataset to evaluate MedGraph using predefined queries with ground truth ranked results. To our knowledge, this technique has not been explored before in biomedical information retrieval. In addition, our results provide some evidence that semantic approaches to search and relevance in biomedical digital libraries that rely on knowledge graph modeling offer better search relevance results when compared with traditional methods in terms of objective metrics.

AB  - In the past 30 years, the study of Chinese heritage at home and abroad has gradually increased. Influenced by Western heritage research, Chinese heritage research has been developed and conducted independently, forming a huge interdisciplinary heritage research system with unique Chinese academic characteristics. Among them, architecture has led to the evaluation, repair, and activation of heritage material carriers. Sociology has focused on the excavation and construction of heritage history and cultural value. Archaeology has continued to promote heritage archaeology and interpretation. Geography, with its comprehensive vision, has made abundant achievements and become increasingly important, but its research context is rather vague. Therefore, to clarify the specific geographical contribution in the field of heritage research, this study, based on CNKI, CSSCI, WOS, and other databases, uses the knowledge graph tool to sort 1, 172 geographical papers from 1990 to 2020. The contributions of this study are as follows: The first concerns obvious stage characteristics. The number of studies has increased rapidly since 2005, peaking thrice in the last decade. The number of articles presented a "zigzag" type development trend, and keywords showed olive type development characteristics. The research has experienced the initial stage of "World Heritage" (1990-2004), the multi-exploration stage of "intangible cultural Heritage", "agricultural heritage" and many other topics (2005-2012), and the in-depth research stage focusing on practice and theory (2013-2020). Second, the cooperation network of scholars presents a "small agglomeration and large dispersion" pattern. This includes a large number of independent scholars, small coauthors scattered sporadically, and a closely linked aggregation group in which the core authors have a high primacy ratio. Third, cultural heritage research is the largest in quantity. The content involves agricultural cultural heritage, intangible cultural heritage, world heritage, and other sections. Agricultural heritage research is at the forefront of the international and becomes hotspots in geographical heritage research, with the literature focusing on the impact of ecologically sustainable environmental change and tourism development and utilization, and gradually expanding its scope to include the origin of the evolution of agricultural, landscape, economic and cultural value research. Based on the analysis of 198 papers with a high citation rate, this study shows the geographical research characteristics of emphasizing the orientation of reality and practice, focusing on the relationship between subject and object, and attaching importance to spatial analysis. In the future, geography should make more contributions to consolidate the leading position of agricultural heritage research, promote theoretical output, build the heritage research academic community, and expand the multi-perspective of heritage research. © 2022 Moscow State University of Psychology and Education.

AB  - Graphs (or networks) are ubiquitous representation in life sciences and medicine, from molecular interactions maps, signaling transduction pathways, to graphs of scientific knowledge and patient- disease-intervention relationships derived from population studies and/or real-world data, such as electronic health records and insurance claims. Recent advance in graph machine learning (ML) approaches such as graph neural networks (GNNs) has transformed a diverse set of problems relying on biomedical networks that traditionally depend on descriptive topological data analyses. Small- and macro- molecules that were not modeled as graphs also saw a bloom in GNN-based algorithms improving the state-of-the-art performance for learning their properties. Comparing to graph ML applications from other domains, life sciences offer many unique problems and nuances ranging from graph construction to graph- level, and bi-graph-level supervision tasks. The objective of this tutorial is twofold. First, it will provide a comprehensive overview of the types of biomedical graphs/networks, the underlying biological and medical problems, and the applications of graph ML algorithms for solving those problems. Second, it will showcase four concrete GNN solutions in life sciences with hands-on experience for the attendees. These hands-on sessions will cover: 1) training and fine-tuning GNN models for small-molecule property prediction on atomic graphs, 2) macro-molecule property and function prediction on residue graphs, 3) bi-graph based bind- ing affinity prediction for protein-ligand pairs, and 4) organizing and generating new knowledge for drug discovery and repurposing with knowledge graphs. This tutorial will also instruct the attendees to develop in two extensions of the software library Deep Graph Library (DGL), including DGL-lifesci and DGL-KE, so that they could jumpstart their own graph ML journey to advance life science research and development.  © 2022 Owner/Author.

AB  - It is difficult to quickly locate and search for specific vulnerabilities and their solutions because vulnerability information is scattered in the existing vulnerability management library. To alleviate this problem, we extract knowledge from vulnerability reports and organize the vulnerability information into the form of a knowledge graph. Then, we implement a tool for knowledge-driven vulnerability searching, KVS. This tool mainly uses the BERT model to realize the vulnerability named entity recognition and construct the vulnerability knowledge graph (VulKG). Finally, we can search vulnerabilities of interest-based on VulKG. The URL of this tool is https://cinnqi.github.io/Neo4j-D3-VKG/.

AB  - Digitisation is a topic that has attracted more and more attention even in the cultural world, leading to the development of specific digital solutions such as DSpace, LIDO and EDM. DSpace is a digital archiving service developed by Hawlett-Packard and MIT, being used by more than 2,000 organisations and institutions worldwide, and LIDO has over time become an industry standard developed to facilitate data harvesting and data interchanging. On the other hand, the EDM knowledge model, which is used for data ingestion in Europeana, has gained publicity precisely because of the increasing visibility of this data aggregator, which currently offers a collection of more than 50 million objects. Unfortunately, Europeana only allows ingestion of semantic structures built around the object-centric approach, thus diminishing the richness of the events. eCHO framework has been developed to facilitate the migration of DSpace archives and LIDO metadata to EDM-compliant datasets without losing the richness of the original data, while maintaining compatibility with Europeana. eCHO also integrates a temporal expression standardization solution and the Cultural Leaf Portal has been developed for data exploration. The validation of the framework was done on the Romanian cultural heritage metadata and on the sample provided by BCU Cluj. © 2023, National Defence University - Carol I Printing House.

AB  - Incorporating linked data-based models into the process of describing cultural objects is increasingly important for cultural heritage. Communities such as libraries, archives, and museums have developed and adopted models specific to their contexts. Without a trivial solution, choosing models to support more general applications is challenging. This Ph.D. aims to analyze existing solutions and practices in these domains and propose validated solutions for the discovery, access, interoperability, and reuse of cultural objects, following the FAIR principles. Transversal to the base models used, this research intends to adopt solutions that balance the simplicity of the models with the satisfaction of the requirements. © 2022 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

AB  - This article presents the semantic portal and Linked Open Data service WarVictimSampo 1914-1922 about the war victims, battles, and prisoner camps in the Finnish Civil and other wars in 1914-1922. The system is based on a database of the National Archives of Finland and additional related data created, compiled, and linked during the project. The system contains detailed information about some 40,000 deaths extracted from several data sources and data about over 1,000 battles of the Civil War. A key novelty of WarVictimSampo 1914-1922 is the integration of ready-to-use Digital Humanities visualizations and data analysis tooling with semantic faceted search and data exploration, which allows, e.g., studying data about wider prosopographical groups in addition to individual war victims. The article focuses on demonstrating how the tools of the portal, as well as the underlying SPARQL endpoint openly available on the Web, can be used to explore and analyze war history in flexible and visual ways. WarVictimSampo 1914-1922 is a new member in the series of "Sampo"model-based semantic portals. The portal is in use and has had 23,000 users, including both war historians and the general public seeking information about their deceased relatives.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - In this chapter, we attempt to combine multimodal data for video soundtrack evaluation, i.e., the task of evaluating whether the music chosen for a video is aesthetically suitable. We propose a method of collecting and combining relevant data from three modalities: audio, video, and symbolic representations of music. We describe and extract a comprehensive multimodal feature library. We construct a database by applying our method on a small set of available data from movie scenes. We implement and tune a classifier on our constructed database of features with adequate results. The proposed classification pipeline attempts to discriminate between real and fake examples of video soundtracks from movies. Finally, we describe some possible improvements on the proposed methods, and we point at some directions for future attempts at this and adjacent tasks. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - PyKale is a Python library for Knowledge-aware machine learning from multiple sources of data to enable/accelerate interdisciplinary research. It embodies green machine learning principles to reduce repetitions/redundancy, reuse existing resources, and recycle learning models across areas. We propose a pipeline-based application programming interface (API) so all machine learning workflows follow a standardized six-step pipeline. PyKale focuses on leveraging knowledge from multiple sources for accurate and interpretable prediction, particularly multimodal learning and transfer learning. To be more accessible, it separates code and configurations to enable non-programmers to configure systems without coding. PyKale is officially part of the PyTorch ecosystem and includes interdisciplinary examples in bioinformatics, knowledge graph, image/video recognition, and medical imaging: https://pykale.github.io/. © 2022 ACM.

AB  - Cultural heritage is closely linked with individual historical figures, who become a key focus for cultural tourism. Confucianism laid the foundation for much of Chinese civilization, and Confucius and Mencius have been studied extensively and have been influential in many parts of the world. Zhu Xi, the founder and master of Neo-Confucianism (an important part of the Mount Wuyi world cultural heritage), has received less research attention. With the big bang of the metaverse, research on the immersive cultural heritage digital documentation and information service for historical figures has become a new perspective. This paper presents a metaverse-based digital documentation framework for historical figures. This framework addresses the digitization of multimodal data for cultural heritage and adapts to the needs of metaverse presentations. For cultural research and cultural preservation, the paper has explored a combined contactless virtual and real cultural heritage experience system. For tourists, we intend to develop an immersive and holistic cultural tourism information service before, during and after the tour. In particular, we have also developed the Zhu Xi metaverse system. This is a step forward in the construction of a metaverse of historical figures. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - We present a text mining framework based on top of the Spark NLP library — comprising of Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) models, which expands on previous work in three main ways. First, we release new RE model architectures that obtain state-of-the-art F1 scores on 5 out of 7 benchmark datasets. Second, we introduce a modular approach to train and stack multiple models in a single nlp pipeline in a production grade library with little coding. Third, we apply these models in practical applications including knowledge graph generation, prescription parsing, and robust ontology mapping. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - The science of Earth observation uses satellites and other sensors to monitor our planet, e.g., for mitigating the effects of climate change. Earth observation data collected by satellites is a paradigmatic case of big data. Due to programs such as Copernicus in Europe and Landsat in the United States, Earth observation data is open and free today. Users that want to develop an application using this data typically search within the relevant archives, discover the needed data, process it to extract information and knowledge and integrate this information and knowledge into their applications. In this chapter, we argue that if Earth observation data, information and knowledge are published on the Web using the linked data paradigm, then the data discovery, the information and knowledge discovery, the data integration and the development of applications become much easier. To demonstrate this, we present a data science pipeline that starts with data in a satellite archive and ends up with a complete application using this data. We show how to support the various stages of the data science pipeline using software that has been developed in various FP7 and Horizon 2020 projects. As a concrete example, our initial data comes from the Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-5P satellite archives, and they are used in developing the Green City use case. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Rock art is globally recognized as significant, yet the resources allocated to the study and exploration of this important form of cultural heritage are often scarce. In areas where numerous rock art sites exist, much of the rock art is unidentified and therefore remains, unrecorded and unresearched. Manually identifying rock art is time-consuming, tedious, and expensive. Therefore, it is necessary to automate many processes in rock art research, which can be accomplished by Machine Learning. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) can greatly facilitate rock art research in many ways, such as through Object Recognition and Detection, Motif Extraction, Object Reconstruction, Image Knowledge Graphs, and Representations. This article is a reflective work on the future of ML for rock art research. As a proof-of-concept, it presents a machine learning method based on recent advances in deep learning to train a model to identify images with painted rock art (pictograms). The efficacy of the proposed method is shown using data collected from fieldwork in Australia. Furthermore, our proposed method can be used to train models that are specific to the rock art found in different regions. We provide the code and the trained models in the supplementary section. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper introduces the project Tools of Knowledge: Modelling the Scientific Instrument Trade, 1550–1914, and focuses on our ongoing development of an ontology to represent knowledge about scientific instrument types produced during this period. After a brief introduction, we discuss the background to the project and a summary of previous work related to knowledge representation of scientific instrument types, particularly in the area of Linked Open Data. We continue with an explanation of the methods used to normalize and structure our data, as well as the vocabularies used to describe relationships between terms. Our interim findings comprise our reflections on the nature of these complex relationships and their semantic representation, alongside examples of analysis that has been facilitated through application of the ontology-in-progress to the project database. To conclude, we summarize our findings so far and provide an indication of how we might expand and enhance the ontology, as well as its contribution to the wider Linked Open Data ecosystem. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Ruins of ancient cities hold valuable information for historians and archeologists and it allows them to learn about the society and culture of these cities. This paper explores the first attempt to virtually rebuild the historic city of Karakorum based on ruins and archeological findings from the 13th century AD. Further, the analytical and practical methods used to discover its unique urban planning and architectural form by reconstructing the city using various resources from archeological documents to historical science documents are introduced. We explore a digitized version of Karakorum city in an immersive and embodied manner because of the latest technological advances in virtual reality, and this allows us to conserve and visualize its cultural heritage. The research objectives of this study are to (1) create a three-dimensional visual model of the Karakorum city as close as possible to its real counterpart, and (2) use a game engine as a development platform for integration and interactive visualization. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Large-scale sound recognition data sets typically consist of acoustic recordings obtained from multimedia libraries. As a consequence, modalities other than audio can often be exploited to improve the outputs of models designed for associated tasks. Frequently, however, not all contents are available for all samples of such a collection: For example, the original material may have been removed from the source platform at some point, and therefore, non-auditory features can no longer be acquired. We demonstrate that a multi-encoder framework can be employed to deal with this issue by applying this method to attention-based deep learning systems, which are currently part of the state of the art in the domain of sound recognition. More specifically, we show that the proposed model extension can successfully be utilized to incorporate partially available visual information into the operational procedures of such networks, which normally only use auditory features during training and inference. Experimentally, we verify that the considered approach leads to improved predictions in a number of evaluation scenarios pertaining to audio tagging and sound event detection. Additionally, we scrutinize some properties and limitations of the presented technique. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Architectural heritage is a lively carrier of historical development, as well as providing a valuable resource for human society. Recently, however, the longevity of architectural heritage has been influenced and even threatened by natural and human factors. Furthermore, the future remains uncertain. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a comprehensive method, namely, digital protection and utilization based on knowledge visualization (DPUKV), to protect and utilize architectural heritage. The most important problem to solve involves transforming digital protection data into a digital inheritance culture. We constructed a technical framework of knowledge acquisition, knowledge reconstruction, knowledge innovation, and knowledge management using qualitative and vertical methods to form hierarchical digital resources of architectural heritage. In particular, the knowledge reconstruction converted tacit knowledge of architectural heritage into explicit knowledge via visualization technology, providing research materials for more scholars. In knowledge innovation, architectural heritage culture was excavated and inherited through knowledge graphs, digital displays, and cultural creation with virtual reality, augmented reality, etc. Furthermore, this method was validated over four years via architectural heritage in China as case studies. In this paper, the buildings of Qinglian Temple in Shanxi, China, are discussed in detail as a case study. The results indicated that this method was effective for preserving architectural heritage and is suitable for other cultural heritage. It is also helpful to improve the public’s protection of and interest in cultural heritage, especially architectural heritage. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The SeMap project, funded by the BBVA Foundation, has among its main objectives, to provide semantics to digitised heritage objects, and to make this information more accessible through web visualisation systems that use spatio-temporal maps. This project has had the collaboration and support of the Ministry of Culture and Sport of the Spanish Government, through CERES, the Digital Network of Museum Collections in Spain. This network manages data related to more than 400,000 objects, located in 113 museums of different specialities and from various thematic and geographical areas. These data are currently accessible through a web portal, but there is no public access to a knowledge graph with this information. Thanks to the collaboration of this entity, SeMap granted the access to this information. With the adequate process, this data has been represented by a knowledge graph. Using the resources offered by the Google Maps and Geonames APIs, it has been possible to georeferenced the data with an acceptable level of precision. This fact, has allowed the design and development of a spatio-temporal map visualisation system with a high level of interaction. This paper describes the process of creating a knowledge graph with this information, based on the CIDOC-CRM model, and using the CERES Cultural Heritage vocabularies and thesauri. The technologies and techniques used to visualise its contents are also described. Finally, the results of the evaluation of the project with end users are presented. In order to evaluate the project, an evaluation session based on the System Usability Scale (SUS) has been conducted. Forty-five secondary school students participated in this session, accessing the tool from the classroom and with the devices with which they usually work.  © 2022 ACM.

AB  - As museums face conflicting demands on maintaining and caring for their collections, opening for visitor engagement, and being more inclusive in their practice, new approaches are needed to museum work. This article introduces a democratic and inclusive approach focusing on the relational properties of the artefact–the Method of the Thing (Tigenes Metode). We use interviews with different museum professionals in Sweden. The method allows knowledge to emerge from the convergence of different actors within and outside the museum who negotiate their expertise, (professional) roles and technical infrastructure of the museum by foregrounding the object rather than the curators’ story. We use the encoding/decoding model to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the method where centring the object allows for a process of democratisation and polyvocality to take shape, thus allowing divergent narratives to emerge. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The aim of this paper is to form an analytical and critical framework to consider the uses of digital platforms in heritage field and practices and to provide methodologies for user profiling based on the identification of local stakeholders and their needs. Within the context of the EU H2020 research project RURITAGE, a resource ecosystem (RRE) of various integrated tools was created for shaping and addressing heritage-led knowledge and bottom-up strategies of local regeneration. More specifically, the RRE was conceived to provide local stakeholders with new methodologies and user-friendly tools based on bottom-up processes for identifying and actioning heritage and territorial features and turning these cultural natural values—as well as the gaps—into opportunities. This paper undertakes a comparative analysis of the integration of tools in other digital platforms for heritage practices and/or regeneration processes to explore the holistic approach to heritage knowledge and the effectiveness in engaging local stakeholders. In addition, it frames methodologies for local stakeholder and related needs identification. Through this comparative analysis among digital heritage platforms and through user profiling to target the needs of users by using the RRE as a case study, the paper explores the challenge of helping communities to shape a local heritage-led collaborative knowledge supported by integrated and user-friendly digital tools and to activate them in preserving and exploiting their territories and building shared and plural cultural heritage understandings, considering cultural heritage as a social need. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Malignant brain tumors pose a substantial burden on morbidity and mortality. As clinical data collection improves, along with the capacity to analyze it, novel predictive clinical tools may improve prognosis prediction. Deep learning (DL) holds promise for integrating clinical data of various modalities. A systematic review of the DL-based prognostication of gliomas was performed using the Embase (Elsevier), PubMed MEDLINE (National library of Medicine), and Scopus (Elsevier) databases, in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. All included studies focused on the prognostication of gliomas, and predicted overall survival (13 studies, 81%), overall survival as well as genotype (2 studies, 12.5%), and response to immunotherapy (1 study, 6.2%). Multimodal analyses were varied, with 6 studies (37.5%) combining MRI with clinical data; 6 studies (37.5%) integrating MRI with histologic, clinical, and biomarker data; 3 studies (18.8%) combining MRI with genomic data; and 1 study (6.2%) combining histologic imaging with clinical data. Studies that compared multimodal models to unimodal-only models demonstrated improved predictive performance. The risk of bias was mixed, most commonly due to inconsistent methodological reporting. Overall, the use of multimodal data in DL assessments of gliomas leads to a more accurate overall survival prediction. However, due to data limitations and a lack of transparency in model and code reporting, the full extent of multimodal DL as a resource for brain tumor patients has not yet been realized. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Few-shot Learning (FSL) is aimed to make predictions based on a limited number of samples. Structured data such as knowledge graphs and ontology libraries has been leveraged to benefit the few-shot setting in various tasks. However, the priors adopted by the existing methods suffer from challenging knowledge missing, knowledge noise, and knowledge heterogeneity, which hinder the performance for few-shot learning. In this study, we explore knowledge injection for FSL with pre-trained language models and propose ontology-enhanced prompt-tuning (OntoPrompt). Specifically, we develop the ontology transformation based on the external knowledge graph to address the knowledge missing issue, which fulfills and converts structure knowledge to text. We further introduce span-sensitive knowledge injection via a visible matrix to select informative knowledge to handle the knowledge noise issue. To bridge the gap between knowledge and text, we propose a collective training algorithm to optimize representations jointly. We evaluate our proposed OntoPrompt in three tasks, including relation extraction, event extraction, and knowledge graph completion, with eight datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can obtain better few-shot performance than baselines. © 2022 ACM.

AB  - This paper is proposed a pipeline aimed at automatically extracting tables from heterogeneous Web sources, such as HTML pages, pdf files and images. Table extraction is one of the actively developing areas of Information Extraction, for which many applications, libraries and frameworks are currently being developed. Nevertheless, most of these tools are focused on solving some specific tasks, for example, only on recognizing tables presented in the form of images. We propose to combine these tasks into a single pipeline that will support the full cycle of table processing – from the stages of their search, recognition and extraction to the stages of semantic analysis and interpretation, that is, the understanding of tables. Understanding tables and population of knowledge bases (knowledge graphs) with meaningful information contained in these tables is the ultimate goal of our design. The first part of the work presents methods for detecting tables on web pages, in pdf documents, as well as methods for automatically detecting attributes and values of objects. The second part presents the conceptual architecture of the Qurma system, designed to extract tables from heterogeneous sources on the Internet. The results section provides an example of a parser that parses the input resource type and passes control to one of the table lookup modules. Next, an operation is performed to determine the main column and link the entities contained in the main column with the corresponding categories in the external knowledge base. © 2022 Al-Farabi Kazakh National University.

AB  - A major problem with using automated classification systems is that if they are not engineered correctly and with fairness considerations, they could be detrimental to certain populations. Furthermore, while engineers have developed cutting-edge technologies for image classification, there is still a gap in the application of these models in human heritage collections, where data sets usually consist of low-quality pictures of people with diverse ethnicity, gender, and age. In this work, we evaluate three bias mitigation techniques using two state-of-the-art neural networks, Xception and EfficientNet, for gender classification. Moreover, we explore the use of transfer learning using a fair data set to overcome the training data scarcity. We evaluated the effectiveness of the bias mitigation pipeline on a cultural heritage collection of photographs from the 19th and 20th centuries, and we used the FairFace data set for the transfer learning experiments. After the evaluation, we found that transfer learning is a good technique that allows better performance when working with a small data set. Moreover, the fairest classifier was found to be accomplished using transfer learning, threshold change, re-weighting and image augmentation as bias mitigation methods. © 2023, Vaclav Skala Union Agency.

AB  - Featured Application: This study purposes a synergy approach to generate the IFC model of very large quantities of data along with its graph database. Giving the identifier to each tile, following database syntax, the historic information and metadata are merged into the graph database. This synergy approach is developed on Grasshopper and Neo4j but is also applicable to other platforms. The investigation of cultural heritage is a continuous process, in which a large scale of metadata is gradually accumulated, i.e., condition data, intervention data, and the comprehension of building techniques. We take the roof tile of Yangxindian Palace as an example. The total number of roof tiles is 17,154. Their positions are various, as they are equally distributed on double-curved irregular surfaces. Their metadata are multisource and heterogeneous. Therefore, the integration between the model and the data can be complex. This paper aims to generate the M1 (metalevel) model with its graph database based on the M3 (metalevel) model through algorithm modeling. This synergy approach consists of three parts. First is the data collection. The unique identifier is used as the index while investigating onsite, which eventually forms the metadata repository. Second is the algorithm modeling. All the roof tiles are rebuilt in Grasshopper with identifiers. Their metadata are merged through Cypher syntax, which can generate the graph database in Neo4j. Third is the delivery. The IFC model and knowledge graph are connected in real time during the whole process. The significance of this paper is to provide a synergy approach and discuss its efficiency for the integration between a model and data of very large quantities. The results show that it is efficient to express the semantic relationships of both conditions and interventions. It is practicable to lightweight the IFC model and to associate metadata into the graph database, enabling online browsing and querying. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This paper presents the critical role of digital humanities methods in safeguarding, research, and revitalisation of intangible cultural heritage. The study explores digitisation methods through a documentation and data management perspective, advocating for data standards that facilitate data interoperability at structure, content, value, and encoding levels. This paper critically analyses existing data standards and conceptual reference models, considering their potential and limitations for documenting and representing intangible cultural heritage. The typology of entities and processes related to intangible cultural heritage is presented and elaborated. Mapping identified entities and processes to individual classes in the CIDOC-CRM model is discussed to support the publication of data and semantic interoperability in the Semantic Web context. © 2023 Stud. ethnol.

AB  - For some decades now, Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM) institutions have published and provided access to information resources in digital format. Recently, innovative approaches have appeared such as the concept of Labs within GLAM institutions that facilitates the adoption of innovative and creative tools for content delivery and user engagement. In addition, new methods have been proposed to address the publication of digital collections as data sets amenable to computational use. In this article, we propose a methodology to create machine actionable collections following a set of steps. This methodology is then applied to several use cases based on data sets published by relevant GLAM institutions. It intends to encourage institutions to adopt the publication of data sets that support computationally driven research as a core activity. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Linked data technologies are natural fits for building and managing controlled vocabularies and authorities, especially in a crowd-sourced environment where managing data integrity can be a challenge. This paper considers the role of researchers in contributing to the health and maintenance the Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts, particularly as it relates to its local Name Authority. It will also demonstrate how applying Linked Open Data technologies and processes in the SDBM can facilitate the symbiotic relationship between the SDBM user community–the “crowd”– and its data as well as prepare the data for reuse in other LOD contexts like Wikidata. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - As the number of published scholarly articles grows steadily each year, new methods are needed to organize scholarly knowledge so that it can be more efficiently discovered and used. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are able to autonomously process scholarly articles at scale and to create machine readable representations of the article content. However, autonomous NLP methods are by far not sufficiently accurate to create a high-quality knowledge graph. Yet quality is crucial for the graph to be useful in practice. We present TinyGenius, a methodology to validate NLP-extracted scholarly knowledge statements using microtasks performed with crowdsourcing. The scholarly context in which the crowd workers operate has multiple challenges. The explainability of the employed NLP methods is crucial to provide context in order to support the decision process of crowd workers. We employed TinyGenius to populate a paper-centric knowledge graph, using five distinct NLP methods. In the end, the resulting knowledge graph serves as a digital library for scholarly articles. © 2022 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents ArtVision, a Semantic Web application that integrates computer vision APIs with the ResearchSpace platform, allowing for the matching of similar artworks and photographs across cultural heritage image collections. The field of Digital Art History stands to benefit a great deal from computer vision, as numerous projects have already made good progress in tackling issues of visual similarity, artwork classification, style detection, gesture analysis, among others. Pharos, the International Consortium of Photo Archives, is building its platform using the ResearchSpace knowledge system, an open-source semantic web platform that allows heritage institutions to publish and enrich collections as Linked Open Data through the CIDOC-CRM, and other ontologies. Using the images and artwork data of Pharos collections, this paper outlines the methodologies used to integrate visual similarity data from a number of computer vision APIs, allowing users to discover similar artworks and generate canonical URIs for each artwork. © 2023-The authors.

AB  - Hyperbolic spaces have recently gained prominence for representation learning in graph processing tasks such as link prediction and node classification. Several Euclidean graph models have been adapted to work in the hyperbolic space and the variants have shown a significant increase in performance. However, research and development in graph modeling currently involve several tedious tasks with a scope of standardization including data processing, parameter configuration, optimization tricks, and unavailability of public codebases. With the proliferation of new tasks such as knowledge graph reasoning and generation, there is a need in the community for a unified framework that eases the development and analysis of both Euclidean and hyperbolic graph networks, especially for new researchers in the field. To this end, we present a novel framework, GraphZoo, that makes learning, designing and applying graph processing pipelines/models systematic through abstraction over the redundant components. The framework contains a versatile library that supports several hyperbolic manifolds and an easy-to-use modular framework to perform graph processing tasks which aids researchers in different components, namely, (i) reproduce evaluation pipelines of state-of-the-art approaches, (ii) design new hyperbolic or Euclidean graph networks and compare them against the state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks, (iii) add custom datasets for evaluation, (iv) add new tasks and evaluation criteria.  © 2022 Owner/Author.

AB  - The knowledge graph connects real-world entities and concepts through their relationships, connects all different types of information to obtain a relationship network, and can analyze "relationship" issues. Creating a knowledge graph is a continuous process, and it needs to continuously learn new knowledge and update existing knowledge in the library as time and events change. However, since the accuracy of the updated new knowledge cannot be guaranteed, the new knowledge must be verified. This paper aims to study the knowledge verification method based on artificial intelligence-based knowledge graph construction. Based on the analysis of the knowledge graph construction process, the knowledge graph construction method and the knowledge verification method, knowledge verification is realized by constructing a probabilistic soft logic model. The experimental results show that the recall rate, F1 value, and AUC value of the candidate knowledge set are verified by the knowledge verification model proposed in this paper. Therefore, it can be inferred that the knowledge verification model proposed in this paper is effective. © 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a digital resources ecosystem prototype of integrated tools and resources to support heritage-led regeneration of rural regions, thanks to a deeper understanding of the complexity of cultural natural landscapes throughout their historical and current development. The ecosystem is conceived as a distributed software platform establishing data ecosystem and open standards for the management of information, aimed at providing different services and applications to address the needs of the various end-users identified. The platform has been conceived and realised in the framework of a Horizon 2020 research project, with a view to building a set of holistic knowledge about rural regions and their cultural and natural heritage and making it available for long-lasting heritage-led territorial processes of change. It is the product of a multidisciplinary collaboration amongst heritage, digital humanities and ICTs experts, and combines data and methodologies from a range of approaches to humanities together with the customisation of effective digital tools. It has been designed for deployment also in cloud systems compliant with the Infrastructure-as-a-Service paradigm. All data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR data). It hosts and integrates different tools, making the data gathered with/for local stakeholders usable and making the same data re-usable within the tools’ functions, generating integrated heritage knowledge. It comprises data on 19 rural pilot territories, where the tools and their integration have been developed and tested, while 62 more are partially included as additional territories which participate in certain activities within the project. The main testers for this platform and its functions are the local stakeholders of these territories. The paper describes and analyses the platform and its impact, discussing the integration of tools as an innovative approach that goes beyond the use of individual tools in shaping a multidimensional vision. It also offers an analysis of the potential of an integrated digital ecosystem in evidence-based and place-based regeneration strategies. Some reflections for developments and cooperation during the pandemic are also presented. © 2022

AB  - In order to prevent the illegal export of paintings abroad, a museum examination using various methods for studying a work of art is carried out. At the same time, an analysis is also made of historical, art history, financial and other information and documents confirming the painting’s authenticity — provenance. Automation of such examination is hampered by the need to take into account numerical values of visual features, quality indicators, and verbal descriptions from provenance. In this paper, we consider the problem of automatic multi-task classification of paintings for museum expertise. A system architecture is proposed that checks provenance, implements a fine-grained image analysis (FGIA) of visual image features, and automatically classifies a painting by authorship, genre, and time of creation. Provenance is contained in a knowledge graph; for its vectorization, it is proposed to use a graph2vec type encoder with an attention mechanism. Fine-grained image analysis is proposed to be performed using searching discriminative regions (SDR) and learning discriminative regions (LDR) allocated by convolutional neural networks. To train the classifier, a generalized loss function is proposed. A data set is also proposed, including provenance and images of paintings by European and Ukrainian artists. © A.A. Martynenko, A.D.

AB  - The care, preservation and display of sensitive cultural heritage materials in museum collections is a well-studied and highly regulated aspect of museum practice. Institutional, national and international guidelines exist to help museums treat these objects with discretion, sensitivity and respect, and ongoing discussions around decolonisation have resulted in growing numbers of these objects being repatriated to the communities from which they originated. However, although there is emerging practice at institutional, local and national levels no such broadly accepted guidelines exist for managing the digital surrogates of these objects which reside in databases around the world. This chapter explores the complexity of managing sensitive data in large repositories, and highlights the need for guidance specifically tailored to the emerging digital spaces. Through a qualitative analysis of open museum data harvested from the European heritage portal Europeana, we show that the proportion of this type of material is small. It could be argued that this makes managing such data even more difficult: what degrees of openness are appropriate? What are the implications for managing a relatively small number of sensitive objects in massive collections retrospectively, once they have been released openly online? It is important to highlight that this paper is not intended as a critique of Europeana itself. The questions we are asking apply across repositories and portals of museums and other heritage data. Indeed, Europeana provides us with an ideal opportunity to think critically about ethical, legal, and policy issues associated with managing large-scale heritage collections online under increasingly ubiquitous regimes of openness in a way that few other projects do. © Chiara Palladino and Gabriel Bodard 2023.

AB  - Qualitative research often involves the collection of data from multiple sources, inclusive of the embodied and multisensorial. These differing data sources, that are not language based, pose difficulties for researchers. Often this multimodal data is collected alongside interviews, field notes and other language-based data and then translated into language. In the process of this translation, the embodied, relational, and multisensorial aspects of this data is often lost. To address this issue, we created Embodied Mapping/s (EM) as an approach for collecting, analyzing and becoming-with non-language-based data. This doing of embodied mapping/s is not about fixing lines and encounters in order to produce a two-dimensional cartography, plan or model; on the contrary it is about exploring differing embodiments and material relations among people and things to create a new inquiry in embodied and multisensorial research and methodologies. Embodied mapping/s suggests a need for a more holistic exploration of qualitative methodologies beyond language and visual communication. Through centralising embodiment, not only as an analytical method but also as something that informs innovative methodologies and methods, these doings of embodied mapping/s offer something novel to qualitative inquiry and embodied methodologies. To evidence the doing of embodied mapping/s, two multi-sited case studies in Canada will be explored—the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa; and the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg, to advance methodological insights in relation to multimodal and multisensorial research. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - As one of the indirect causality, cascaded causality can be used to construct the event knowledge graph, causal inference, scenario analysis, etc. The existing GCN methods lack the mining of context information and relevant entity information, resulting in the poor ability of causality inference, which inevitably affects the extraction accuracy of cascade causality. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a causality extraction model based on a two-stage GCN to improve the extraction accuracy. To obtain rich features of entities, this work combines sentiment polarity and knowledge base to get the causality candidate entity library. Firstly, the BERT model is pre-trained using context information and relevant entity information extracted from the entity library to obtain the final entity nodes. Secondly, using the semantic dependency graph, each possible edge between any two entity nodes can be obtained, which are input into the first stage GCN to get a preliminary directed graph of causality. Finally, the directed graph of causality is input into the second stage GCN to achieve deep causality multi-hop inference. Thus, the cascade causality is inferred and extracted by the two-stage GCN model. Experiments show that the extraction accuracy of cascade causality has been further improved. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Stories are important tools for recounting and sharing the past. To tell a story one has to put together diverse information about people, places, time periods, and things. We detail here how a machine, through the power of Semantic Web, can compile scattered and diverse materials and information to construct stories. Through the example of the WeChangEd research project on women editors of periodicals in Europe from 1710-1920 we detail how to move from archive, to a structured data model and relational database, to Wikidata, to the use of the Stories Services API to generate multimedia stories related to people, organizations and periodicals. As more humanists, social scientists and other researchers choose to contribute their data to Wikidata we will all benefit. As researchers add data, the breadth and complexity of the questions we can ask about the data we have contributed will increase. Building applications that syndicate data from Wikidata allows us to leverage a general purpose knowledge graph with a growing number of references back to scholarly literature. Using frameworks developed by the Wikidata community allows us to rapidly provision interactive sites that will help us engage new audiences. This process that we detail here may be of interest to other researchers and cultural heritage institutions seeking web-based presentation options for telling stories from their data. © 2023-The authors.

AB  - In the course of just a few years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the prominent supervised learning approach that brings the power of deep representation learning to graph and relational data. An ever-growing body of research has shown that GNNs achieve state-of-the-art performance for problems such as link prediction, fraud detection, target-ligand binding activity prediction, knowledge-graph completion, and product recommendations. As a result, GNNs are quickly moving from the realm of academic research involving small graphs to powering commercial applications and very large graphs. This talk will provide an overview of some of the research that AWS AI has been doing to facilitate this transition, which includes developing the Deep Graph Library (DGL)-an open source framework for writing and training GNN-based models, improving the computational efficiency and scaling of GNN model training for extremely large graphs, developing novel GNN-based solutions for different applications, and making it easy for developers to train and use GNN models by integrating graph-based ML techniques in graph databases. © 2022 Owner/Author.

AB  - In the last few years, the spreading of new technologies, such as augmented reality (AR), has been changing our way of life. Notably, AR technologies have different applications in the cultural heritage realm, improving available information for a user while visiting museums, art exhibits, or generally a city. Moreover, the spread of new and more powerful mobile devices jointly with virtual reality (VR) visors contributes to the spread of AR in cultural heritage. This work presents an augmented reality mobile system based on content-based image analysis techniques and linked open data to improve user knowledge about cultural heritage. In particular, we explore the uses of traditional feature extraction methods and a new way to extract them employing deep learning techniques. Furthermore, we conduct a rigorous experimental analysis to recognize the best method to extract accurate multimedia features for cultural heritage analysis. Eventually, experiments show that our approach achieves good results with respect to different standard measures. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The project presented aims to restore the historical and artistic context of the island of San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice and the correct representation of the Giorgio Cini Foundation and its collections in the Wikimedia environment, in order to improve its visibility in a digital perspective. The focus was the description of their cultural heritage with particular attention to that preserved in the Palazzo Cini Gallery, adopting the Wikidata platform and thus in the form of Linked Open Data. The project was carried out between February and March 2023, during a residency grant at the Foundation itself. After identifying the resources related to the context of the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, evaluating the quality of the information and the reliability of the sources cited, if present, new elements were created such as people, institutes, works of art and bibliographic resources. Through the creation of cultural datasets it has been possible to semantically return the entire historical-artistic heritage in a diachronic manner, at the same time creating new tools that may be used by researchers for future digital projects. © 2010 eum edizioni università di macerata.

AB  - Digital preservation technologies are now being increasingly adopted by cultural heritage organizations. This cultural heritage data is often disseminated in the form of digital text through a variety of channels such as Wikipedia, cultural heritage archives, etc. To acquire knowledge from digital data, the extraction technique becomes an important part. However, in the case of digital text, which has characteristics such as ambiguity, complex grammar structures such as the Thai language, and others, it makes it more challenging to extract information with a high level of accuracy. We thus propose a method for improving the performance of data extraction techniques based on word features, multiple instance learning, and unseen word mapping. Word features are used to improve the quality of word definition by concatenating parts of speech (POS) and word position is used to establish the accurate definition of a word and convert all of this into a vector. In addition, we use multiple instance learning to solve issues where words do not fully express the meaning of the triple. We also cluster the particular word to find the predicate word by removing words that are irrelevant between the subject and the object. The difficulty of having a new set of words that have never been trained before can be overcome by using unseen word mapping with subword and nearest neighbor word mapping.We conducted several experiments on a cultural heritage knowledge graph to show the efficacy of the proposed method. The results demonstrated that our proposed technique outperforms existing models currently utilized in relation to extraction systems. It can achieve excellent accuracy since its precision, recall, and F1 score are 0.89, 0.88, and 0.89, respectively. Furthermore, it also performed well in terms of unseen word prediction, precision, recall, and F1 score, which were 0.81, 0.87, and 0.84, respectively. © 2022 River Publishers. All rights reserved.

AB  - This chapter presents an AI-based approach to the systemic collection of user experience data for further analysis. This is an important task because user feedback is essential in many use cases, such as serious games, tourist and museum applications, food recognition applications, and other software based on Augmented Reality (AR). For AR game-based learning environments user feedback can be provided as Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) which has been emerging in the past years as it exploits the fusion of sensors and data mining techniques. A wide range of sensors have been used by MMLA experiments, ranging from those collecting students’ motoric (relating to muscular movement) and physiological (heart, brain, skin, etc.) behaviour, to those capturing social (proximity), situational, and environmental (location, noise) contexts in which learners are placed. Recent research achievements in this area have resulted in several techniques for gathering user experience data, including eye-movement tracking, mood tracking, facial expression recognition, etc. As a result of user’s activity monitoring during AR-based software use, it is possible to obtain temporal multimodal data that requires rectifying, fusion, and analysis. These procedures can be based on Artificial Intelligence, Fuzzy logic, algebraic systems of aggregates, and other approaches. This chapter covers theoretical and practical aspects of handling AR user’s experience data, in particular, MMLA data. The chapter gives an overview of sensors, tools, and techniques for MMLA data gathering as well as presenting several approaches and methods for user experience data processing and analysis. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This paper offers an overview of some of the highlights of the 2022 NISO Plus Annual Conference that was held virtually from February 15 - February 18, 2022. This was the third such conference and the second to be held in a completely virtual format due to the Pandemic. These conferences have resulted from the merger of NISO and the National Federation of Abstracting and Information Services (NFAIS) in June 2019, replacing the NFAIS Annual Conferences and offering a new, more interactive format. As with last year, there was no general topical theme, but there were topics of interest for everyone working in the information ecosystem - from the practical subjects of standards and metadata quality to preprints, Wikidata, archiving and digital preservation, Open Science and Open Access, and ultimately Globalization of the Information Infrastructure, the Metaverse, and Visions of the Future. With speakers and attendees from around the world and across multiple time zones and continents, it truly was a global conversation!  © 2022 - The authors. Published by IOS Press.

AB  - In this paper, we provide an overview of the upcoming ImageCLEF campaign. ImageCLEF is part of the CLEF Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum since 2003. ImageCLEF, the Multimedia Retrieval task in CLEF, is an ongoing evaluation initiative that promotes the evaluation of technologies for annotation, indexing, and retrieval of multimodal data with the aim of providing information access to large collections of data in various usage scenarios and domains. In its 21st edition, ImageCLEF 2023 will have four main tasks: (i) a Medical task addressing automatic image captioning, synthetic medical images created with GANs, Visual Question Answering for colonoscopy images, and medical dialogue summarization; (ii) an Aware task addressing the prediction of real-life consequences of online photo sharing; (iii) a Fusion task addressing late fusion techniques based on the expertise of a pool of classifiers; and (iv) a Recommending task addressing cultural heritage content-recommendation. In 2022, ImageCLEF received the participation of over 25 groups submitting more than 258 runs. These numbers show the impact of the campaign. With the COVID-19 pandemic now over, we expect that the interest in participating, especially at the physical CLEF sessions, will increase significantly in 2023. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - During the normalization stage of the COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control, the safety threats caused by improper epidemic prevention measures of airlines have become the primary concern for air passengers. Negative e-WOM related to safety perception obtained based on online multimodal reviews of travel websites has become an important decision-making basis for potential air passengers when making airline choices. This study aims to examine the relationship between potential air passengers’ negative safety perception and the usefulness of online reviews, as well as to test the moderating effect of review modality and airline type. It also further explores the effectiveness and feasibility of applying big data sentiment analysis to e-WOM management. To this end, the theoretical model of negative safety perception, review modality, and airline type affecting review usefulness was constructed. Then we select 10 low-cost airlines and 10 full-service airlines, respectively, according to the number of reviews sorted by the TripAdvisor website, and use crawling techniques to obtain 10,485 reviews related to COVID-19 safety of the above companies from December 2019 to date, and conduct safety perception sentiment analysis based on Python’s Textblob library. Finally, to avoid data overdispersion, the model is empirically analyzed by negative binomial regression using R software. The results indicate that (1) Negative safety perception significantly and negatively affects review usefulness, that is, extreme negative safety perception can provide higher review usefulness for potential air passengers. (2) Review modality and airline type have a significant moderating effect on the relationship between negative safety perception and review usefulness, in which multimodal reviews and full-service airlines both weakened the negative impact of negative safety perception on review usefulness. The theoretical model in this paper is both an extension of the application of big data sentiment analysis techniques and a beneficial supplement to current research findings of e-WOM, providing an important reference for potential air passengers to identify useful reviews accurately and thus reduce safety risks in online decision-making.

AB  - The Beyond 2022 project aims to create a virtual archive by digitally reconstructing and digitizing historical records lost in a catastrophic fire which consumed items in the Public Record Office of Ireland in 1922. The project is developing a knowledge graph (KG) to facilitate information retrieval and discovery over the reconstructed items. The project decided to adopt Semantic Web technologies to support its distributed KG and reasoning. In this article, we present our approach to KG generation and management. We elaborate on how we help historians contribute to the KG (via a suite of spreadsheets) and its ontology. We furthermore demonstrate how we use named graphs to store different versions of factoids and their provenance information and how these are serviced in two different endpoints. Modeling data in this manner allows us to acknowledge that history is, to some extent, subjective and different perspectives can exist in parallel. The construction of the KG is driven by competency questions elicited from subject matter experts within the consortium. We avail of CIDOC-CRM as our KG's foundation, though we needed to extend this ontology with various qualifiers (types) and relations to support the competency questions. We illustrate how one can explore the KG to gain insights and answer questions. We conclude that CIDOC-CRM provides an adequate, albeit complex, foundation for the KG and that named graphs and Linked Data principles are a suitable mechanism to manage sets of factoids and their provenance.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Human knowledge provides a formal understanding of the world. Knowledge graphs that represent structural relations between entities have become an increasingly popular research direction toward cognition and human-level intelligence. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the knowledge graph covering overall research topics about: 1) knowledge graph representation learning; 2) knowledge acquisition and completion; 3) temporal knowledge graph; and 4) knowledge-aware applications and summarize recent breakthroughs and perspective directions to facilitate future research. We propose a full-view categorization and new taxonomies on these topics. Knowledge graph embedding is organized from four aspects of representation space, scoring function, encoding models, and auxiliary information. For knowledge acquisition, especially knowledge graph completion, embedding methods, path inference, and logical rule reasoning are reviewed. We further explore several emerging topics, including metarelational learning, commonsense reasoning, and temporal knowledge graphs. To facilitate future research on knowledge graphs, we also provide a curated collection of data sets and open-source libraries on different tasks. In the end, we have a thorough outlook on several promising research directions.  © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - New generations should learn about the Cultural Heritage (CH) that surrounds them to value and preserve it. Common strategies for learning CH include lectures, textbooks, and also cultural visits to CH sites. Cultural visits allow very rich learning experiences but are quite challenging to prepare and carry out. This paper presents Cultural Heritage Educational Semantic Tool (CHEST), a web application that enables teachers to identify monuments of interest and annotate them with learning tasks. The created learning tasks will be carried out by students using an existing application, named Casual Learn, that makes use of a dataset of learning tasks created from information available as Linked Open Data. CHEST overcomes an identified limitation of Casual Learn by giving the teachers the possibility of enriching the existing semantic dataset of monuments and associated learning tasks with customized content while hiding the technical complexity of Semantic Web technologies. Additionally, CHEST promotes the reusability and adaptation of learning tasks by different teachers. An early version of CHEST was used by two secondary school teachers in real-life situations to design customized tasks for their students. These tasks were then carried out by the students via Casual Learn. These teachers gave a high usability score to CHEST and were interviewed to obtain further feedback. They were keen to publish new tasks, share them with other teachers, and reuse tasks from other teachers. © 2022 ACM.

AB  - Sparked by issues of quality and lack of proper documentation for datasets, the machine learning community has begun developing standardised processes for establishing datasheets for machine learning datasets, with the intent to provide context and information on provenance, purposes, composition, the collection process, recommended uses or societal biases reflected in training datasets. This approach fits well with practices and procedures established in GLAM institutions, such as establishing collections' descriptions. However, digital cultural heritage datasets are marked by specific characteristics. They are often the product of multiple layers of selection; they may have been created for different purposes than establishing a statistical sample according to a specific research question; they change over time and are heterogeneous. Punctuated by a series of recommendations to create datasheets for digital cultural heritage, the paper addresses the scope and characteristics of digital cultural heritage datasets; possible metrics and measures; lessons from concepts similar to datasheets and/or established workflows in the cultural heritage sector. This paper includes a proposal for a datasheet template that has been adapted for use in cultural heritage institutions, and which proposes to incorporate information on the motivation and selection criteria, digitisation pipeline, data provenance, the use of linked open data, and version information. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Multimodal Machine Learning (MMML) has emerged as a promising topic with the ability to jointly utilize data from several data modalities to improve performance and address difficult real-world problems. Large-scale multimodal datasets and the availability of powerful computing resources have sped up the development of sophisticated deep learning architectures that are designed for multimodal data. In this paper, we conducted a systematic literature review focusing on the deep learning architectures used in MMML that combines image and text modalities. The objective of this paper includes looking at various models and deep learning architectures used in MMML with image and text data, learning about the fusion techniques used to combine both modalities, datasets that are used to train the models and limitations of these models. For this purpose, we have garnered 341 research articles from 5 digital library database and after an extensive review process, we have 75 research papers that allow us to thoroughly assess MMML. Our findings from these papers shed light on providing new directions for further study in this evolving and interdisciplinary domain. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The Chinese nation culture, which is of abundant resources, various categories and art styles, origins from the Chinese nation and is deeply rooted in ordinary people, has kept a long record of the historical memory and continued the cultural vein. Indeed, the Chinese nation culture is the foundation and the soul of the Chinese nation. The cultural heritage, which has the trait of widespread dissemination, long history, various styles, unique form of expression and being nonrenewable, is the precious information for exploring the development of the ancient human civilization. Nowadays, with the rapid development of information technology and the widespread impact of globalization, the formation of cultural inheritance has changed fundamentally, especially in the way of interpersonal inheritance style of the non-material cultural heritage. Therefore, there is an urgent need to construct bridges between the resource and the media, the content and the technology in order to sustain the digital inheritance of the Chinese cultural heritage. This paper is organised based on the advanced intelligent computing, digital media and virtual reality/augmented reality technology, and combines the dissemination process and artistic characteristics of the cultural heritage. From the perspective of the development status, frontier trends, hot issues and development trends, the key activation technologies are analyzed and summarized in terms of the collection of cultural heritage, the combination of virtual and real intelligent display and interaction, and the construction of intelligent platforms. Firstly, in the aspect of the collection of cultural heritage, in the view of the bottleneck problems that exist in the digitization of complex cultural relics, the key technologies of digital collection and reconstruction are introduced; the feature extraction algorithms of cultural heritage elements, themes, styles, etc., as well as the key technologies in the process of digital simulation to analyze the compositional features, distribution features, color features, and modeling features of cultural heritage are summarized; the key technologies of cultural heritage understanding and construction that are based on semantic feature analysis, understanding and recognition are introduced; the advantages and disadvantages of traditional image processing and deep learning methods in the process of digital simulation of national culture are analysed and discussed, and the characteristics and efficiency of the current algorithms are compared. Besides, the existing problems and difficulties are expounded, and an insight into the future of digital simulation of national culture is provided. Next, in the aspect of the combination of virtual and real intelligent display and interaction, for the characteristics of physical display and virtual display of cultural heritage, the key technologies of digital restoration of cultural heritage are reviewed. The important role of cutting-edge information technology including multi-modal image processing, few-shot learning and stylized image generation methods is introduced. Meanwhile, the cutting-edge research based on multi-source heterogeneous big data analysis, knowledge graph and deep learning in the digital restoration of cultural heritage are also reviewed. To satisfied the interactive 3D display needs of cultural heritage, the content-based natural human-computer interaction technology is introduced, which is combined with text, audio, video, semantics and story retrieval of cultural history. Virtual interactive presentation of new technologies is introduced in terms of real-time realistic technology, virtual-real fusion rendering, and augmented reality technology. Last but not least, in the aspect of intelligent platform construction, there still remains many problems at present, such as the decentralized system management of the cultural heritage intelligent platform, which leads to poor business collaboration, and due to the lack of unified data, it is still difficult to share data mutually. Also, the problems of the difficulty in system maintenance, the high management costs, and the inconvenience for users still need to be solved. In the view of the above mentioned problems, the key technology research of the cultural heritage big data model and the private cloud architecture and the related intelligent platform construction projects are introduced. The above key activation technologies of cultural heritage are actively integrated into the major national development strategies, and these technologies are conducive to excavating and improving the protection and inheritance technology of national cultural heritage, promoting their rational use, and expanding their dissemination influence, which is of great significance to carry forward Chinese civilization, promote cultural prosperity, build demonstration areas for ethnic minorities and enhance cultural confidence. © 2022, Editorial Office of Journal of Image and Graphics.

AB  - Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich information of patient health status, which usually include both structured and unstructured data. There have been many studies focusing on distilling valuable information from structured data, such as disease codes, laboratory test results, and treatments. However, relying on structured data only might be insufficient in reflecting patients’ comprehensive information and such data may occasionally contain erroneous records. With the recent advances of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, an increasing number of studies seek to obtain more accurate results by incorporating unstructured free-text data as well. This paper reviews studies that use multimodal data, i.e. a combination of structured and unstructured data, from EHRs as input for conventional ML or DL models to address the targeted tasks. We searched in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Digital Library, PubMed, and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library for articles related to ML and DL-based multimodal EHR studies. With the final 94 included studies, we focus on how EHR data from different modalities were combined and interacted using conventional ML and DL techniques, the influence of the relationship between multimodal data on their fusion strategy, and how these algorithms were applied in EHR-related tasks. Further, we investigate the advantages and limitations of these fusion methods and indicate future directions for ML-based multimodal EHR research. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Contemporary legal digital libraries such as Lexis Nexis and WestLaw allow users to search case laws using sophisticated search tools. At its core, various forms of keyword search and indexing are used to find documents of interest. While newer search engines leveraging semantic technologies such as knowledgebases, natural language processing, and knowledge graphs are becoming available, legal databases are yet to take advantage of them fully. In this paper, we introduce an experimental legal document search engine, called Prism, that is capable of supporting legal argument based search to support legal claims.  © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - Biographical collections are available on the Web for close reading. However, the underlying texts can also be used for data analysis and distant reading, if the documents are available as data. Such data is usable for creating intelligent user interfaces to biographical data, including Digital Humanities tooling for visualizations, data analysis, and knowledge discovery in biographical and prosopographical research. In this paper, we re-use biographical collection data from a historiographical perspective for analyzing the underlying collection. For example: What kind of people have been included in the collection? Does the language used for describing female biographees differ from that for men? As a case study, the Finnish National Biography, available as part of the Linked Open Data service and semantic portal BiographySampo-Finnish Biographies on the Semantic Web is used. The analyses show interesting results related to, e.g., how specific prosopographical groups, such as women or professional groups are represented and portrayed. Various novel statistics and network analyses of the biographees are presented. Our analyses give new insights to the editors of the National Biography as well as to researchers in biography, prosopography, and historiography. The presented approach can be applied also to similar biography collections in other countries. © 2023-The authors. Published by IOS Press.

AB  - The rapid growth of research publications has placed great demands on digital libraries (DL) for advanced information management technologies. To cater to these demands, techniques relying on knowledge-graph structures are being advocated. In such graph-based pipelines, inferring semantic relations between related scientific concepts is a crucial step. Recently, BERT-based pre-trained models have been popularly explored for automatic relation classification. Despite significant progress, most of them were evaluated in different scenarios, which limits their comparability. Furthermore, existing methods are primarily evaluated on clean texts, which ignores the digitization context of early scholarly publications in terms of machine scanning and optical character recognition (OCR). In such cases, the texts may contain OCR noise, in turn creating uncertainty about existing classifiers’ performances. To address these limitations, we started by creating OCR-noisy texts based on three clean corpora. Given these parallel corpora, we conducted a thorough empirical evaluation of eight Bert-based classification models by focusing on three factors: (1) Bert variants; (2) classification strategies; and, (3) OCR noise impacts. Experiments on clean data show that the domain-specific pre-trained Bert is the best variant to identify scientific relations. The strategy of predicting a single relation each time outperforms the one simultaneously identifying multiple relations in general. The optimal classifier’s performance can decline by around 10% to 20% in F-score on the noisy corpora. Insights discussed in this study can help DL stakeholders select techniques for building optimal knowledge-graph-based systems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Knowledge Graphs are relevant for many applications, but are inherently incomplete. Thus, Link Prediction methods have been proposed to infer new triples in order to complete a given Knowledge Graph. Many Link Prediction methods ignore literals, in spite of the fact that literals can express important information about entities not encoded in relations between entities. The existing methods that do incorporate literal information (e. g., LiteralE) introduce complex architectures by modifying the model or the loss-function. In our research paper, we propose a new approach that relies on graph transformations to transform a graph in such a way that existing Link Prediction methods can leverage the literal information. In particular, we define three transformations and evaluate them in comparison to state-of-The-Art approaches. In most cases, the additional triples generated by our transformations lead to a performance increase and even state-of-The-Art performance can be reached when comparing against LiteralE. It turned out that even a reductionistic transformation is able to archive comparable results like current, more complex, state-of-The-Art approaches which incorporate literals. © 2022 ACM.

AB  - Within clinical, biomedical, and translational science, an increasing number of projects are adopting graphs for knowledge representation. Graph-based data models elucidate the interconnectedness among core biomedical concepts, enable data structures to be easily updated, and support intuitive queries, visualizations, and inference algorithms. However, knowledge discovery across these “knowledge graphs” (KGs) has remained difficult. Data set heterogeneity and complexity; the proliferation of ad hoc data formats; poor compliance with guidelines on findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability; and, in particular, the lack of a universally accepted, open-access model for standardization across biomedical KGs has left the task of reconciling data sources to downstream consumers. Biolink Model is an open-source data model that can be used to formalize the relationships between data structures in translational science. It incorporates object-oriented classification and graph-oriented features. The core of the model is a set of hierarchical, interconnected classes (or categories) and relationships between them (or predicates) representing biomedical entities such as gene, disease, chemical, anatomic structure, and phenotype. The model provides class and edge attributes and associations that guide how entities should relate to one another. Here, we highlight the need for a standardized data model for KGs, describe Biolink Model, and compare it with other models. We demonstrate the utility of Biolink Model in various initiatives, including the Biomedical Data Translator Consortium and the Monarch Initiative, and show how it has supported easier integration and interoperability of biomedical KGs, bringing together knowledge from multiple sources and helping to realize the goals of translational science. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - In recent years, the digital twin has attracted widespread attention as an important means of digitalization and intelligence. However, the digital twin is becoming more and more complex due to the expansion of need on the simulation of multi-scale and multi-scenario in reality. The instance of digital twin in references mostly concentrates a particular application, while it is still a lack of a method for constructing the complex digital twin in the total elements, the variable scale of working environments, changeable process, not even the coupling effects. In this paper, a novel modeling method for such a complex digital twin is proposed based on the standardized processing on the model division and assembly. Firstly, the complex model of digital twin is divided into several simple models according to the composition, context, component, and code in 4C architecture. Composition and context make the digital twin focus on the effective elements in a specific scale and scenario. Component and code develop the digital twin in standard-based modularization. Secondly, assemble the simple models of digital twins into the complex model through information fusion, multi-scale association and multi-scenarios iterations. Ontology establishes the complete information library of the entities on different digital twins. Knowledge graph bridges the structure relationship between the different scales of digital twins. The scenario iterations realize the behavior interaction and the accuracy calculation results. It provides an implementable method to construct a complex model of digital twin, and the reuse of components and code also enables rapid development of digital twins. © 2022

AB  - Drug discovery is the process of new drug identification. This process is driven by the increasing data from existing chemical libraries and data banks. The knowledge graph is introduced to the domain of drug discovery for imposing an explicit structure to integrate heterogeneous biomedical data. The graph can provide structured relations among multiple entities and unstructured semantic relations associated with entities. In this review, we summarize knowledge graph-based works that implement drug repurposing and adverse drug reaction prediction for drug discovery. As knowledge representation learning is a common way to explore knowledge graphs for prediction problems, we introduce several representative embedding models to provide a comprehensive understanding of knowledge representation learning. © 2021

AB  - This work combines semantic reasoning and machine learning to create tools that allow curators of the visual art collections to identify and correct the annotations of the artwork as well as to improve the relevance of the content-based search results in these collections. The research is based on the Joconde database maintained by the French Ministry of Culture that contains illustrated artwork records from main French public and private museums representing archeological objects, decorative arts, fine arts, historical and scientific documents, etc. The Joconde database includes semantic metadata that describes properties of the artworks and their content. The developed methods create a data pipeline that processes metadata, trains a Convolutional Neural Network image classification model, makes prediction for the entire collection and expands the metadata to be the base for the SPARQL search queries. We developed a set of such queries to identify noise and silence in the human annotations and to search image content with results ranked according to the relevance of the objects quantified by the prediction score provided by the deep learning model. We also developed methods to discover new contextual relationships between the concepts in the metadata by analyzing the contrast between the concepts’ similarities in the Joconde’s semantic model and other vocabularies and we tried to improve the model prediction scores based on the semantic relations. Our results show that cross-fertilization between symbolic AI and machine learning can indeed provide the tools to address the challenges of the museum curators work describing the artwork pieces and searching for the relevant images. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - For the past decades, Cultural Heritage (CH) is commonly documented by digital-based imaging and analytical techniques. This documentation is used as a support by heritage scientists to study and help the preservation of CH objects. Multiple techniques or modalities are usually required and applied to complete the documentation and the possible diagnostic from it. In this paper we explored multimodal imaging strategies to survey, analyse and share semantically enriched digital replicas. Three challenging casestudies from the SUMUM research project aims to illustrate efficient multi-source approaches in multi-scalar, multi-temporal and multi-spectral contexts. From multimodal data acquisitions, a photogrammetric-based registration method (TACO) has been developed in order to exploit a 2D/3D semantic annotation process implemented into a CH oriented collaborative web platform (AIOLI). In the exemples showed, the structure and the content of the annotations work is based from condition reports provided by conservation and restoration experts. To this end, all the documentation gathered on CH objects are either directly merged by image based registration while complementary analysis can be spatially anchored to annotations as linked resources. The dissemination part is explored by built-in AIOLI's collaborative features or external Potree-based viewer, to enhance the accessibility of the final 3D annotated scenes for further expertises or wide-public events and purposes.  © 2022 Author(s).

AB  - Conversational agents have been recently incorporated into Virtual Heritage to provide more immersive and interactive user experience. However, existing chatbot guides lack the capacity to leverage the rich background knowledge graphs (KGs) to provide better interactions between visitors and cultural collections. In this paper, we present a KG driven conversational museum guide that answers visitor's questions and recommend relevant art objects in a virtual exhibition, while modelling user interest to offer personalised information and guidance.  © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - The paper investigates various deep learning approaches for classifying movies by genre. To prepare the initial dataset, a system for parsing textual information and images from the Internet Movie Database, IMDB (https://www.imdb.com/) was implemented. Pandas (Python library) methods were applied to generate the dataset. Particular attention was paid to the preparation of target information and the choice of the learning loss function due to the fact that the problem was reduced to a multi-label classification. A number of transfer learning algorithms have been implemented for convolutional neural network models and transformer architectures when processing movie posters, as well as simple machine learning models and deep learning transformer-type models for text classification. The paper proposes a method for complexing extracted features from heterogeneous data in another neural network to improve classification accuracy. It was possible to achieve an increase in the average cosine distance for the test sample by 3% higher than when using standard models and about 7% in sense of intersection over union metric.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Based on a literature review, we present a framework for structuring the application of graph theory in the library domain. Our goal is to provide both researchers and libraries with a standard tool to classify scientific work, at the same time allowing for the identification of previously underrepresented areas where future research might be productive. To achieve this, we compile graph theoretical approaches from the literature to consolidate the components of our framework on a solid basis. The extendable framework consists of multiple facets grouped into five categories whose elements can be arbitrarily combined. Libraries can benefit from these facets by using them as a point of reference for the (meta)data they offer. Further work on formally defining the framework’s categories as well as on integration of other graph-related research areas not discussed in this article (e.g. knowledge graphs) would be desirable and helpful in the future. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - NeuralKG is an open-source Python-based library for diverse representation learning of knowledge graphs. It implements three kinds of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) methods, including conventional KGEs, GNN-based KGEs, and Rule-based KGEs. With a unified framework, NeuralKG successfully reproduces link prediction results of these methods on benchmarks, freeing users from the laborious task of reimplementing them, especially for some methods originally written in non-python programming languages. Besides, NeuralKG is highly configurable and extensible. It provides various decoupled modules that can be mixed and adapted to each other. Thus with NeuralKG, developers and researchers can quickly implement their own designed models and obtain the optimal training methods to achieve the best performance efficiently. We built a website http: //neuralkg.zjukg.org to organize an open and shared KG representation learning community. The library, experimental methodologies, and model reimplement results of NeuralKG are all publicly released at https: //github.com/zjukg/NeuralKG. © 2022 ACM.

AB  - With the rising popularity of user-generated genealogical family trees, new genealogical information systems have been developed. State-of-the-art natural question answering algorithms use deep neural network (DNN) architecture based on self-attention networks. However, some of these models use sequence-based inputs and are not suitable to work with graph-based structure, while graph-based DNN models rely on high levels of comprehensiveness of knowledge graphs that is nonexistent in the genealogical domain. Moreover, these supervised DNN models require training datasets that are absent in the genealogical domain. This study proposes an end-to-end approach for question answering using genealogical family trees by: (1) representing genealogical data as knowledge graphs, (2) converting them to texts, (3) combining them with unstructured texts, and (4) training a transformer-based question answering model. To evaluate the need for a dedicated approach, a comparison between the fine-tuned model (Uncle-BERT) trained on the auto-generated genealogical dataset and state-of-the-art question-answering models was performed. The findings indicate that there are significant differences between answering genealogical questions and open-domain questions. Moreover, the proposed methodology reduces complexity while increasing accuracy and may have practical implications for genealogical research and real-world projects, making genealogical data accessible to experts as well as the general public. © 2023-The authors.

AB  - Objective: To improve learning efficiency and prediction accuracy, multi-task learning aims to tackle multiple tasks based on the generic features assumption those are prior to task-related features. Multi-task learning technique has been applied in a variety of computer vision applications on the aspects of object detection and tracking, object recognition, human-based identification and human facial attribute classification. The worldwide digitization of artwork has called to art research from the aspect of computer vision and further facilitated cultural heritage preservation. Automatic artwork analysis has been developing the art style, the content of the painting, or the oriented attributes analysis for art research. Our multi-task learning for automatic art analysis application is based on the historical, social and artistic information. The existing multi-task joint learning methods learn multiple tasks based on a labor cost and time consuming weighted sum of losses. Our method illustrates art classification and art retrieval tools for the application of Digital Art Museum, which is convenient for researchers to deeply understand the connotation of art and further harness traditional cultural heritage research. Method: A multiple objectives learning method is based on Bayesian theory. In terms of Bayesian analyzed results, we use the correlation between each task and introduce task cluster (clustering) to constrain the model. Then, we formulate a multi-task loss function via maximizing the Gaussian possibility derived of homoscedastic uncertainty via task-dependent uncertainty in Bayesian modeling. Result: In order to slice into art classification and art retrieval missions, we identify the SemArt dataset, a recent multi-modal benchmark for understanding the semantic essence of the art, which is designed to retrieve the art paginating cross different modal, and could be readily modified for the classification of art paginating. This dataset contains 21 384 art painting images, which is randomly split into training, validation and test sets based on 19 244, 1 069 and 1 069 samples, respectively. First, we conduct art classification experiments on the SemArt dataset, and then evaluate the performance through classification accuracy, i.e., the proportion of properly predicted paintings to the total amount of paintings in test procedure. The art classification results demonstrate that our model is qualified based on proposed adaptive multi-task learning technique while in the previous multi-task learning model, the weight of each task in fixed. For example, in "Timeframe" classification task, the improvement is about 4.43% with respect to the previous model. In order to calculate the task-specific weighting, the previous model barriers are limited to twice back forward tracing. The art classification results also validate the importance of introducing weighting constraints in our model. Next, we also evaluate our model on cross-modal art retrieval tasks. Experiments are conducted through Text2Art Challenge Evaluation where painting samples are sorted out based on their similarity to an oriented text, and vice versa. The calculated ranking results are evaluated by median rank and recall rate at K, with K being 1, 5 and 10 on the test dataset and performances. Median rank denotes the value separating the higher half of the relevant ranking position amount all samples, whereas recall at rate K represents the rate of samples for which its relevant image is in the top K positions of the ranking. Compared with the most recent knowledge-graph-based model in the context of author attribute, the improvement is about 9.91% in average which is consistent of classification results. Finally, we compare our model with manual evaluators. Following an artistic text, which contains comment, title, author, type, school and time schedule, participants are required to pick the most proper painting image out from a collection of 10 images. There are two distinct levels in this task as mentioned below: the collection of painting images are easy to random selected from the test set, and the difficulty is where the 10 collected images have the identical attribute category (i.e., portraits, landscapes). All participants are required to conduct the task for 100 artistic texts in each level. The performance is reported as the proportion of clear feedbacks over all responses. Our demonstrated results also illustrate that our modeling accuracy is quite closer to human evaluators. Conclusion: We harness an adaptive multi-task learning method to weight multiple loss functions based on Bayesian theory for automatic art analysis tasks. Furthermore, we conduct several experiments on the public available art dataset. The synthesized results on this dataset include both art classification and art retrieval challenges. © 2022, Editorial Office of Journal of Image and Graphics. All right reserved.

AB  - In knowledge representation systems for Cultural Heritage (CH) there is a vast amount of curated textual information for CH objects and sites. However, the large-scale study of the accumulated knowledge is difficult as long as it is provided in the form of free text. By extracting the most significant pieces of information from textual descriptions of CH objects and sites and compiling them in a single comprehensive knowledge graph, conforming to a standard would facilitate its exploitation from multiple perspectives including study, presentation and narratives. The method proposed by this research work was to employ Natural Language Processing, and reinforcement learning for semantic knowledge extraction, and a knowledge representation standard of the CH domain for the knowledge graph thus making the extracted knowledge directly compatible with linked open data platforms and CH representation systems. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The decontextualization of the historical-artistic heritage to which a large part of the Spanish ecclesiastical centres has been subjected, is a clear example of the progressive loss of cultural heritage. The artwork, once it’s outside of the place for which it was originally conceived, is completely distorted, preventing historians, scientists, or visitors, from contemplating it entirety or to establish any hypothesis about its origin and original configuration. Inspired by the case of the Gothic stalls of the Cathedral of Girona, currently completely dismantled, this article presents a virtual reconstruction exercise to be integrated into an application for interactive visualization of the complex in its original context. For this, equirectangular images of the current building are geometrically integrated with the virtual model of the stalls reconstructed from the photogrammetric survey of part of the elements, still existing and scattered in different places. The technique makes it possible to hyper-realistically combine real and virtual images, offering the viewer a “mixed” virtual tour of the central nave of the cathedral by incorporating the reconstructed virtual model in the originally designed location. The proposed methodology supposes a new visualization strategy of this type of elements that, in an immersive and interactive, economic, and ubiquitous way, must allow an advance in the dissemination and recovery of decontextualized heritage. © 2022, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

AB  - This paper focuses on ancient Japanese Mokkan (woodcuts) to discuss the background, current status and issues in the digitisation of cultural heritage, including matters of research, protection, and legal rights. As valuable primary sources, Mokkan are important in a wide range of academic fields, includ¬ing history and linguistics. On the other hand, they are extremely fragile and fragmented. Digital technologies can support an improvement in access and study of this material. In this paper, we illustrate the current efforts to improve digitisation workflows and strengthen research capacity: we discuss open data and open access, equal and transparent inter-institutional collabora¬tion, the application of the IIIF standard, the construction of a character data¬base search system, and the application of Deep Learning technology. The issue of open data and open access is particularly challenging in Japan, where there is still a gap between the legal principles and the actual situation of cultural heritage institutions. In addition, information needs to be standard¬ized and aggregated, but at the same time the specificity and historical char-acteristics of the different materials need to be addressed. In this paper, we strongly advocate for the establishment of methods for sharing cultural herit¬age data. In humanities research, the linkage, open access and standardization of information has become essential, not only to foster data-driven research but also to ensure wide access and dissemination of cultural heritage in Japan. For this reason, we encourage equal and open collaboration not just across cultural heritage stakeholders, but across society as a whole. © Chiara Palladino and Gabriel Bodard 2023.

AB  - Background: LINCS, "Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures", and IDG, "Illuminating the Druggable Genome", are both NIH projects and consortia that have generated rich datasets for the study of the molecular basis of human health and disease. LINCS L1000 expression signatures provide unbiased systems/omics experimental evidence. IDG provides compiled and curated knowledge for illumination and prioritization of novel drug target hypotheses. Together, these resources can support a powerful new approach to identifying novel drug targets for complex diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), which continues to inflict severe harm on human health, and resist traditional research approaches. Results: Integrating LINCS and IDG, we built the Knowledge Graph Analytics Platform (KGAP) to support an important use case: identification and prioritization of drug target hypotheses for associated diseases. The KGAP approach includes strong semantics interpretable by domain scientists and a robust, high performance implementation of a graph database and related analytical methods. Illustrating the value of our approach, we investigated results from queries relevant to PD. Approved PD drug indications from IDG’s resource DrugCentral were used as starting points for evidence paths exploring chemogenomic space via LINCS expression signatures for associated genes, evaluated as target hypotheses by integration with IDG. The KG-analytic scoring function was validated against a gold standard dataset of genes associated with PD as elucidated, published mechanism-of-action drug targets, also from DrugCentral. IDG's resource TIN-X was used to rank and filter KGAP results for novel PD targets, and one, SYNGR3 (Synaptogyrin-3), was manually investigated further as a case study and plausible new drug target for PD. Conclusions: The synergy of LINCS and IDG, via KG methods, empowers graph analytics methods for the investigation of the molecular basis of complex diseases, and specifically for identification and prioritization of novel drug targets. The KGAP approach enables downstream applications via integration with resources similarly aligned with modern KG methodology. The generality of the approach indicates that KGAP is applicable to many disease areas, in addition to PD, the focus of this paper. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The flexibility of Knowledge Graphs to represent heterogeneous entities and relations of many types is challenging for conventional data integration frameworks. In order to address this challenge the use of Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) to encode entities from different data sources into a common lower-dimensional embedding space has been a highly active research field. It was recently discovered however that KGEs suffer from the so-called hubness phenomenon. If a dataset suffers from hubness some entities become hubs, that dominate the nearest neighbor search results of the other entities. Since nearest neighbor search is an integral step in the entity alignment procedure when using KGEs, hubness is detrimental to the alignment quality. We investigate a variety of hubness reduction techniques and (approximate) nearest neighbor libraries to show we can perform hubness-reduced nearest neighbor search at practically no cost w.r.t speed, while reaping a significant improvement in quality. We ensure the statistical significance of our results with a Bayesian analysis. For practical use and future research we provide the open-source python library kiez at https://github.com/dobraczka/kiez. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - In this era of information explosion, in order to help students select suitable resources when facing a large number of online courses, this paper proposes a knowledge graph-based learning path recommendation method to bring personalized course recommendations to students. The knowledge graph of professional courses is realized by completing the construction of the ontology library of online courses, and the graph database Neo4j is used to store the knowledge graph. SpringBoot is used to build the backend system and implement a set of course recommendation algorithm to filter the learning resources after analyzing the courses students have taken and the quality of course learning, and generate a list of course recommendations for each student. After developing the system based on this method, it can effectively help learners recommend course learning paths and greatly meet students' learning needs. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Based on a brief review of knowledge genes and knowledge units knowledge representation and knowledge graphs this paper explores the qualitative structure of knowledge and the basis of quantitative analysis and points out that knowledge has three characteristics namely phenotype exo-type configuration endo-type and sum type quantity value. This paper uses logical analysis to reveal knowledge phenotypes from phenomenon to essence including language and text type formula symbol type and graph chart type. Knowledge configuration can be identified by subject category and feature concept and knowledge value can be calculated by and based on data and information. It is proposed to use knowledge floral graph and knowledge floral formula as a comprehensive representation of qualitative knowledge structure and quantitative knowledge analysis and it is suggested to adopt three hypotheses of knowledge transformation and academic evaluation benchmarking method from the three characteristics of knowledge to analyze static knowledge characteristics and process dynamic knowledge evolution. Qualitative knowledge construction and quantitative knowledge analytics are both suitable for analyzing knowledge objects and knowledge subjects and possess unique academic evaluation application value. This paper advocates to innovate library and information science through knowledge analytics and promote the blossom of knowledge flowers through library and information science. 9 figs. 1 tab. 38 refs. © 2022, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

AB  - Tracking individuals or groups based on their hidden and/or emergent behaviors is an indispensable task in homeland security, mental health evaluation, and consumer analytics. On-line and off-line communication patterns, behavior profiles and social relationships form complex dynamic evolving knowledge graphs. Investigative search involves capturing and mining such large-scale knowledge graphs for emergent profiles of interest. While graph databases facilitate efficient and scalable operations on complex heterogeneous graphs, dealing with incomplete, missing and/or inconsistent information and need for adaptive querying pose major challenges. We address these by proposing an inexact graph pattern matching method, which is implemented in a graph database with a scoring mechanism that helps identify hidden behavioral patterns. PINGS (Procedures for INvestigative Graph Search), a graph database library of procedures for investigative graph search is presented. Results presented demonstrate the capability of detecting individuals/groups meeting query criteria as well as the iterative query performance in graph databases. We evaluate our approach on three datasets: a synthetically generated radicalization dataset, a publicly available patient's ICU hospitalization stays dataset, and a crime dataset. These varied datasets demonstrate the wide-range applicability and the enhanced effectiveness of observing suspicious or latent trends in investigative domains. © 2008-2012 IEEE.

AB  - As an important tool for the communication between the readers and the library, the message board of the university library is an information exchange and feedback platform built by the library in order to promote the mutual communication, understanding, understanding and trust between the readers and improve the quality of library service. The readers' message data presents the characteristics of large amount of data and poor correlation with each other, which belongs to the weak structure data. It is difficult to directly analyze the existing problems and relevant improvement strategies of university library. This paper analyzes 8,443 messages in the message boards of 'Project 211' universities. Using TextRank to obtain entities, relations and attributes from message text, this paper proposes a knowledge graph construction framework for message board, and analyzes the knowledge graph. It verifies the feasibility of using this method to construct knowledge graph for message data, and provides a new research method for the visualization and mining of message data in university library.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Scholarly communication process is constantly evolving to include new artifacts that present a part of the research. The traditional practice of conference and journal publications being the key artifacts to publish have changed to include new or complementary artifacts that help the audience grasp the research outcomes as much as possible as a single unit or whole. We also witnessed this trend with the library community, where different stakeholders – users, library patrons, or management – require that new research artifacts, such as scientific blogs, datasets, or citation links, be included in the library catalogs alongside existing artifacts. Knowledge Graphs (KG) have been applied as means to bring together data from heterogeneous sources, within or across multiple domains, and this has shown to be an effective approach. In this work, we adopt them to bring research artifacts of different types in a more compact research unit. This includes the approach to specify it and its components considering the library environment, and the accompanying methodology used to implement it. Finally, we explore the value and potential use cases from this integration for the library community in the domain of economics. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Controlled vocabularies have proved to be critical for data interoperability and accessibility. In the cultural heritage (CH) domain, description of artworks are often given as free text, thus making filtering and searching burdensome (e.g. listing all artworks of a specific type). Despite being multi-language and quite detailed, the Getty’s Art & Architecture Thesaurus –a de facto standard for describing artworks– has a low coverage for languages different than English and sometimes does not reach the required degree of granularity to describe specific niche artworks. We build upon the Italian Vocabulary of Artworks, developed by the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage (MIC) and a set of free text descriptions from ArCO, the knowledge graph of the Italian CH, to propose an extension of the Vocabulary of Artworks and align it to the Getty’s thesaurus. Our framework relies on text matching and natural language processing tools for suggesting candidate alignments between free text and terms and between cross-vocabulary terms, with a human in the loop for validation and refinement. We produce 1.166 new terms (31% more w.r.t. the original vocabulary) and 1.330 links to the Getty’s thesaurus, with estimated coverage of 21%. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Within the scope of the SeMap project, we have developed a web-based tool that aims to offer innovative dissemination of movable assets held in museums, linking them semantically and through interactive maps. SeMap is focused on depicting the objects that are catalogued in CER.ES, the Spanish Digital Network of Museum Collections, which offers a catalogue of 300,000+ objects. To properly represent such objects in the SeMap tool, which considers their semantic relations, we needed to preprocess the data embedded in catalogues, and to design a knowledge graph based on CIDOC-CRM. To that end, the collaboration among academia, heritage curators and public authorities was of high relevance. This paper describes the steps taken to represent the CER.ES objects in the SeMap tool, focusing on the interdisciplinary collaboration. We also bring the results of a usability test, that proves the developed map is usable. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The surging amount of biomedical literature & digital clinical records presents a growing need for text mining techniques that can not only identify but also semantically relate entities in unstructured data. In this paper we propose a text mining framework comprising of Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) models, which expands on previous work in three main ways. First, we introduce two new RE model architectures - an accuracy-optimized one based on BioBERT and a speed-optimized one utilizing crafted features over a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN). Second, we evaluate both models on public benchmark datasets and obtain new state-of-the-art F1 scores on the 2012 i2b2 Clinical Temporal Relations challenge (F1 of 73.6, +1.2% over the previous SOTA), the 2010 i2b2 Clinical Relations challenge (F1 of 69.1, +1.2%), the 2019 Phenotype-Gene Relations dataset (F1 of 87.9, +8.5%), the 2012 Adverse Drug Events Drug-Reaction dataset (F1 of 90.0, +6.3%), and the 2018 n2c2 Posology Relations dataset (F1 of 96.7, +0.6%). Third, we show two practical applications of this framework - for building a biomedical knowledge graph and for improving the accuracy of mapping entities to clinical codes. The system is built using the Spark NLP library which provides a production-grade, natively scalable, hardware-optimized, trainable & tunable NLP framework. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Many graph-based citation recommendation algorithms have been proposed; however, most of them utilize local citation behavior from the citation network that results in recommending papers in the same proximity as the query article. In this paper, we propose to capture the global citation behavior in the citation network and use it to enhance the citation recommendation performance. Specifically, we develop a novel citation network embedding algorithm, ConvCN, to encode the citation relationship among papers. We then propose to enhance existing graph-based citation recommendation algorithms by incorporating ConvCN to improve the recommendation efficacy. ConvCN has been shown to improve the citation recommendation performance by 44.86% and 34.87% on average in terms of Bpref and F-measure@20, respectively. The findings from this research not only confirm that global citation behavior could be additionally useful for improving the performance of traditional citation recommendation algorithms but also shed light on the possibility to adapt the proposed ConvCN algorithm for other recommendation tasks that rely on graph-like information such as items recommendation in social networks and people recommendation in referral networks. © 2021, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Knowledge graphs are an established technology in the field of information retrieval and question answering. However, the focus is mostly on searching web pages and related documents and less on video formats, resulting in the fact that queries on videos for refining the search are often neglected. In this demo, we show a framework for recognizing faces in YouTube videos and linking them to the matching entities in DBpedia using the thumbnails available in DBpedia. By linking the videos from YouTube with the information from DBpedia, more complex search queries can be made possible. We will present both the frontend of the application, including the search, adding more YouTube videos and formulating complex queries, as well as the architecture and the libraries used in the application. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Classical Chinese poetry has a long history and is a precious cultural heritage of humankind. Displaying the classical Chinese poetry in a visual way, helps to cross cultural barriers in different countries, making it enjoyable for all the people. In this paper, we construct a multi-modal knowledge graph for classical Chinese poetry (PKG), in which the visual information of words in the poetry are incorporated. Then a multi-modal pre-training language model, i.e., PKG-Bert, is proposed to obtain the poetry representation with visual information, which bridges the semantic gap between different modalities. PKG-Bert achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the poetry-image retrieval task, showing the effectiveness of incorporating the multi-modal knowledge. The large-scale multi-modal knowledge graph of classical Chinese poetry will be released to promote the researches in classical Chinese culture area. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Deep Learning (DL) methods have proved to be very successful for many image classification tasks. In the SPICE project, we are researching on an intelligent system that classifies artworks to support several tasks such as metadata curation and linking across image collections. However, applying DL methods to real-world cultural heritage collections for the task of artwork subject classification is problematic. Objects in this domain are characterised by different levels of heterogeneity: of media and techniques, of categories, of time-periods, just to mention a few. This heterogeneity makes the related training features sparsely distributed. In this paper, we report on an empirical investigation where we apply neuro-symbolic, Deep Learning techniques to a paradigmatic case of cultural heritage archive: the Tate Gallery collection open data. We pose the question of what type of feature engineering could help in reducing the impact of data sparsity in this domain. Crucially, we explore how neuro-symbolic learning, combining image features, textual metadata, and Knowledge Graph embeddings, could help in mitigating the problems derived from data sparsity in cultural heritage image archives. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - This paper presents the SSH Data Citation Service (DCS), a software tool that provides functionalities to find, collect and analyse metadata related to digital objects, in particular datasets, referred to in citation strings. Starting from the citation string of a dataset, the DCS aggregates metadata related to the data from different sources: the repository hosting the dataset, PID Registration Agencies and Knowledge Graphs and gives a unified view of information about datasets coming from these sources. The DCS has been designed and developed in the Social Sciences & Humanities Open Cloud (SSHOC) project. It has been used in a project activity as a tool to help investigate approaches adopted for data citation by Social Sciences and Humanities organisations managing data repositories, and as an utility to help data managers to create citation metadata. The paper presents motivations underlying the creation of the tool, the design principles adopted, an overall description of the functionalities of the current release and a summary of ongoing activities. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Semantic relations have been adopted in many research fields, including the semantic web, information retrieval, and QA systems. The aim of the semantic relations is to remove conceptual and terminological confusion. This is achieved by specifying a set of general concepts that characterize domains and their definitions and interrelationships. This research describes how to detect semantic relations, including synonyms, hyponyms, and hypernym s based on WordNet and entities of a knowledge graph (KG). This KG was built from two resources: ACM Digital Library and Wikipedia. We used natural language processing and the deep learning approach for processing data before generating the KG with an effective algorithm. We chose five of 245 categories in the ACM Digital Library to evaluate the proposed method. The generated results show that our system has excellent performance.  © 2022 - IOS Press.

AB  - Linkages between research outputs are crucial in the scholarly knowledge graph. They include online citations, but also links between versions that differ according to various dimensions and links to resources that were used to arrive at research results. In current scholarly communication systems this information is only made available post factum and is obtained via elaborate batch processing. In this paper we report on work aimed at making linkages available in real-time, in which an alternative, decentralised scholarly communication network is considered that consists of interacting data nodes that host artifacts and service nodes that add value to artifacts. The first result of this work, the “Event Notifications in Value-Adding Networks” specification, details interoperability requirements for the exchange real-time life-cycle information pertaining to artifacts using Linked Data Notifications. In an experiment, we applied our specification to one particular use-case: distributing Scholix data-literature links to a network of Belgian institutional repositories by a national service node. The results of our experiment confirm the potential of our approach and provide a framework to create a network of interacting nodes implementing the core scholarly functions (registration, certification, awareness and archiving) in a decentralized and decoupled way. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - With the rapid advancement of semantic web technologies, various Knowledge Graphs have been created by various institutes and organizations to preserve data. What is challenging is how humans can intuitively access and learn from such large-scale knowledge. In this paper, to achieve a meaningful, engaging, and enjoyable interaction between visitors and large-scale knowledge graphs, we will propose a knowledge graph-based conversational agent that selects and packages user-interested information into narratives, models user interests, and takes initiative (e.g. answering user questions, providing recommendations, or requesting feedback or clarification) to convey knowledge. As an application, we will focus on the cultural heritage domain and create a museum guide. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Objective: The objective was to present the Schema.org vocabulary as an alternative for adapting digital catalogs to the current context. Methods: The research is characterized as a bibliographic review, carried out from a qualitative approach, aiming to explore the relationship between the themes: digital catalogs and Schema.org. Results: The Schema.org presents as main contributions, the structuring of data for better interpretation of search engines, resulting in accurate results and semantic enrichment, integrated with rich snippets and knowledge graph technologies. Conclusions: It is considered that the adherence of Schema.org associated with the representation instruments used in the context of libraries, can favor the exposure of data on the Web, expanding the reach of the content of the catalogs. Thus, in addition to benefiting from Web technologies, libraries could contribute to its development, acting as providers of quality metadata, retrieved as enriched results together with other sources of information. © 2022, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of maintaining CIDOC CRM-based knowledge graph (KG) by non-expert users. We present a practical method using Wikibase and specific data input conventions for creating and editing linked data that can be exported as CIDOC CRM compliant RDF. Wikibase is a proven and maintained software for generic KG maintenance with a fixed but flexible data model and easy-to-use user interface. It runs the collaboratively edited Wikidata KG, as well as increasing amount of domain specific services. The proposed solution introduces a set of data input conventions for Wikibase that can be used to generate CIDOC CRM compliant RDF without programming. The process relies on the aforementioned data input rules combined with generic mapping implementations and metadata stored as part of the KG. We argue that this convention over coding makes the system more easily approachable and maintainable for users that want to adhere to the CIDOC CRM principles, but are not ontology experts. As part of the preliminary evaluation of the proposed solution, an example on managing Cultural Heritage data in the military history domain with discussion on the limitations of the approach is presented. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This work presents the extended abstract of the doctoral thesis about the Visual Exploration of digital cultural artifacts. We exploited the synergy between semantic technologies and knowledge exploration tools for digital libraries, proposing a system which includes: semantic enrichment of textual content; a user interface for search and exploration of a digital library through visual navigation of a knowledge graph of topics; the extensions of the central system to leverage the extracted knowledge. For example, interface components hide complex queries to find interesting topics for users; an integrated system to semi-automatically manage the knowledge contained in the images, generating video trailers of books; and a collaborative system to improve extracted data quality. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence solutions are empowering many fields of knowledge, including art. Indeed, the growing availability of large collections of digitized artworks, coupled with recent advances in Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision, offer new opportunities for researchers in these fields to help the art community with automatic and intelligent support tools. In this discussion paper, we outline some research directions that we are exploring to contribute to the challenge of understanding art with AI. Specifically, our current research is primarily concerned with visual link retrieval, artwork clustering, integrating new features based on contextual information encoded in a knowledge graph, and implementing these methods on social robots to provide new engaging user interfaces. The application of Information Technology to fine arts has countless applications, the most important of which concerns the preservation and fruition of our cultural heritage, which has been severely penalized, along with other sectors, by the ongoing COVID pandemic. On the other hand, the artistic domain poses entirely new challenges to the traditional ones, which, if addressed, can push the limits of current methods to achieve better semantic scene understanding. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - In the last years, virtual exhibitions have been widely adopted to enhance traditional museums and enable active interaction with culture without posing any physical constraints. Nevertheless, people interested in cultural heritage still behave as visitors. To fully engage them, we propose to let cultural heritage lovers play the role of exhibition curators. In authoring virtual exhibitions, users have to perform a data selection phase that poses several challenges, including finding data sources and extracting data of interest. We aim to take advantage of data published as Knowledge Graphs in the Linked Open Data format. Users can query geographically distributed artworks thanks to their linking nature, manipulate heterogeneous data, and easily customise their exhibitions by exploiting the wide range of available cultural heritage knowledge graphs. However, the complexity of linked open data query languages (such as SPARQL) threatens their exploitation. Consequently, we need to mask SPARQL technical challenges and guide users in naturally posing questions to unlock the potentialities of linked open data to a broader audience. We propose a virtual exhibition authoring tool that guides users from knowledge graphs querying to the automatic generation of virtual experiences. The Knowledge Graph query phase relies on ELODIE, a natural language interface to scaffold users in retrieving data of interest without asking for technical skills in query languages. We introduce our prototype by describing its operating mechanism and by detailing its components. We present a Van Gogh's experience as a use case by collecting all the artist's artworks published on DBpedia (a well-known and general purpose knowledge graph) and organise them in a virtual reality-based virtual exhibition. Finally, we conclude by overviewing advantages and technical challenges posed by linked open data in designing and developing knowledge graph exploitation tools. © 2021

AB  - Scientific conferences are essential for developing active research communities, promoting the cross-pollination of ideas and technologies, bridging between academia and industry, and disseminating new findings. Analyzing and monitoring scientific conferences is thus crucial for all users who need to take informed decisions in this space. However, scholarly search engines and bibliometric applications only provide a limited set of analytics for assessing research conferences, preventing us from performing a comprehensive analysis of these events. In this paper, we introduce the AIDA Dashboard, a novel web application, developed in collaboration with Springer Nature, for analyzing and comparing scientific conferences. This tool introduces three major new features: 1) it enables users to easily compare conferences within specific fields (e.g., Digital Libraries) and time-frames (e.g., the last five years); 2) it characterises conferences according to a 14K research topics from the Computer Science Ontology (CSO); and 3) it provides several functionalities for assessing the involvement of commercial organizations, including the ability to characterize industrial contributions according to 66 industrial sectors (e.g., automotive, financial, energy, electronics) from the Industrial Sectors Ontology (INDUSO). We evaluated the AIDA Dashboard by performing both a quantitative evaluation and a user study, obtaining excellent results in terms of quality of the analytics and usability.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Archaeological and historical-artistic studies, together with correlated multidisciplinary research, regardless of the language of writing or technical terminology, find a natural connection between them in the topographical positioning. Studying a monument or area from an archaeological and historical-artistic point of view cannot be separated from a long search for the material published in specialized libraries. SCIBA aims to drastically reduce search times and provide an instant overview of particular themes through knowledge extraction from reference texts and the visualization of the concerned cartography. With a simplified user experience, the user will be able to identify the area, location, archaeological site or single monument of interest, exactly as already used to do with contemporary navigation systems, and in addition will be able to view in real-time all the related bibliography and to navigate the key concepts in a knowledge graph.  © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Extracurricular reading can broaden the horizons of college students. Exploring the patterns of students’ extracurricular learning and analyzing the relationships between extracurricular learning interests and book borrowing behaviours and the intervention mechanism of book borrowing can provide scientific guidance and basis for the comprehensive development of college students. Most of the existing learning interest analysis models have ignored other feedbacks generated in learner’s behaviours, and there are very few studies on learning interests based on book borrowing behaviours. Therefore, this paper conducts an analysis of college students’ extracurricular learning interests based on book borrowing behaviours. Based on the data of college students’ book borrowing behaviours obtained from the service terminal of the library management system, an extracurricular learning interest model for learners was constructed, and the extracurricular learning interest degrees of college students were calculated based on the borrowing time and the number of borrowing times. A multilayer interest model based on knowledge graph was also constructed to further improve the accuracy of the analysis results of learners’ extracurricular learning interests. © 2022, International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning.

AB  - In this article, we investigate how explanatory AI can better harness the full potential of the vast and rich library of books at our disposal. Based on a recent theory of explanations from Ordinary Language Philosophy that frames the process of explaining as illocutionary process of answering to questions, we have developed a new kind of interactive and adaptive e-book. Using the most recent question answering technology, our e-book automatically generates a specialized knowledge graph from a collection of books and other resources and extracts questions and answers. With this knowledge graph, the e-book generates interactive and adaptive explanations that guide readers through the materials in a pedagogically productive manner.

AB  - Code sharing and reuse is a widespread use practice in software engineering. Although a vast amount of open-source Python code is accessible on many online platforms, programmers often find it difficult to restore a successful runtime environment. Previous studies validated automatic inference of Python dependencies using pre-built knowledge bases. However, these studies do not cover sufficient knowledge to accurately match the Python code and also ignore the potential conflicts between their inferred dependencies, thus resulting in a low success rate of inference. In this paper, we propose PyCRE, a new approach to automatically inferring Python compatible runtime environments with domain knowledge graph (KG). Specifically, we design a domain-specific ontology for Python third-party packages and construct KGs for over 10,000 popular packages in Python 2 and Python 3. PyCRE discovers candidate libraries by measuring the matching degree between the known libraries and the third-party resources used in target code. For the NP-complete problem of dependency solving, we propose a heuristic graph traversal algorithm to efficiently guarantee the compatibility between packages. PyCRE achieves superior performance on a real-world dataset and efficiently resolves nearly half more import errors than previous methods. © 2022 ACM.

AB  - The traditional record-based approach used in Digital Libraries has gone as far as it could. To support the needs and activities of different kinds of users, we propose a graph-based ‘holistic’ representation of DL knowledge, describing the documents’ metadata, physical aspects, content, context and lifecycle. We also propose its implementation based on a framework in which Formal Ontologies play the role of data schemas for the LPG-based DBs. This enables automated reasoning on the DL data, and we propose the use of multiple inference strategies. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Since its first formalization, the Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) field has shown diverse extensions of the FCA paradigm. A recent example is Graph-FCA, an extension of FCA to graphs. In the context of Graph-FCA, a notion of concept of neighbors has been introduced to support a form of nearest neighbour search over the nodes of a graph. Concepts of neighbors have been used for diverse tasks, such as knowledge graph completion and relation classification in texts. In this paper, we present CONNOR, a Java library for the computation of concepts of neighbors on RDF graphs. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - With the global outbreak of virulent infectious diseases such as COVID-19, the lack of medical resources has become a serious social problem. More and more online users who encounter physical discomfort will first choose to look up the relevant symptoms on the Internet. Some online platforms have been able to understand the symptoms entered by users and provide auxiliary diagnosis suggestions. However, the professionalism and accuracy of online health and medical Question Answering (QA) systems are very insufficient. How to obtain and utilize massive medical symptom data from multiple data sources such as the Internet, medical symptom libraries and medical professional electronic books has become a difficult problem. The development of big data, artificial intelligence, and especially knowledge graph technology has provided ideas and methods to solve this problem. In this paper, a medical knowledge graph NWNU-KG is constructed on the basis of multi-source data, and the BiLSTM-CRF-CNN-Dict (BCCD) joint model is used for entity recognition and relationship extraction of user-asked questions to implement a healthcare knowledge QA system. Numerous experiments have found that the joint model BCCD proposed in this paper has a higher accuracy rate compared with the best available models, and can filter the answers to questions and return them to users in multi-source, heterogeneous and massive healthcare data, which has some practical value. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - The automatic extraction of knowledge from a Digital Library is a crucial task in the world of Digital Humanities by enabling the discovery of information on a scale that is not achievable by human experts alone. However, the automation of information extraction processes brings the typical problems of a fully automated process, namely data quality and explainability of the results. This paper proposes a system that allows domain experts to collaboratively validate information previously automatically extracted from a Digital Library (DL), supporting an incremental data quality improvement approach, specifically through entity linking. Furthermore, rather than seeing just the results of the extraction process, the domain experts can trace the origin of where the AI recognized a specific entity (i.e. a “snippet” of text or an image). In order to allow the domain experts to contextualize the information they need to validate (i.e. topics, descriptions, etc.) leveraging the Knowledge Graph potential, in the proposed use case, the validation is integrated into the interface designated for the DL semantic exploration. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Electric power inspection work ticket is an important text document in the electric power inspection business. The current methods of generating work tickets have problems such as irregular manual filling, low efficiency, and poor knowledge library portability, etc. To solve the problems, this paper constructs the knowledge graph (KG) in the field of power inspection and proposes a knowledge-guided method for intelligently generating work tickets of electric power inspections. Firstly, the named entity of the component or part in the work order is recognized by applying a bidirectional long and short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) and conditional random field (CRF). Secondly, the bi-encoder is applied for entity disambiguation to make the entity-mention with the description text of defect in the work order corresponds to the node of the component or part defect in the KG. Finally, the relevant paths of the target linked entity are inquired in the KG, and the semantic similarities based on the cosine distance between the text of work order and the texts of paths are calculated to select the optimal path, and the nodes under this path are filled in the slot to generate work tickets. This paper conducts simulation experiments and analysis results for named entity recognition, entity disambiguation, and semantic similarity comparison to verify the effectiveness of work ticket intelligent generation of electric power inspection. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Knowledge Graphs (KG) have gained increasing importance in science, business and society in the last years. However, most knowledge graphs were either extracted or compiled from existing sources. There are only relatively few examples where knowledge graphs were genuinely created by an intertwined human-machine collaboration. Also, since the quality of data and knowledge graphs is of paramount importance, a number of data quality assessment models have been proposed. However, they do not take the specific aspects of intertwined human-machine curated knowledge graphs into account. In this work, we propose a graded maturity model for scholarly knowledge graphs (KGMM), which specifically focuses on aspects related to the joint, evolutionary curation of knowledge graphs for digital libraries. Our model comprises 5 maturity stages with 20 quality measures. We demonstrate the implementation of our model in a large scale scholarly knowledge graph curation effort. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The FAQ system is to match the questions asked by the user with the questions in the FAQ library, and subsequently return the answers to the questions according to the smenatic similarity between questions. The existing matching methods of question pair are not specially designated for the OS domain and do not incorporate domain knowledge. The screenshots of Operating System provided by user usually contain important information, which can be uesed to improve the effectiveness of question matching method. In this paper, we evaluate the important of text in image with the highlighted evaluation, location evaluation, and text evaluation, and filter out important text for question matching. In order to use knowledge of Operation System, we introduce a pretraining model incorporating the domain knowledge that can be used for problem matching. In the experiment, the method with knowledge graph and image information can fully improve the accuracy rate, recall rate and F1 score of the matching reuslts compared to the mainstream method. © VDE VERLAG GMBH - Berlin - Offenbach.

AB  - Few-shot knowledge graph (KG) completion task aims to perform inductive reasoning over the KG: given only a few support triplets of a new relation./(e.g., (chop,./, kitchen), (read,./, library)), the goal is to predict the query triplets of the same unseen relation./, e.g., (sleep,./, ?). Current approaches cast the problem in a meta-learning framework, where the model needs to be first jointly trained over many training few-shot tasks, each being defined by its own relation, so that learning/prediction on the target few-shot task can be effective. However, in real-world KGs, curating many training tasks is a challenging ad hoc process. Here we propose Connection Subgraph Reasoner (CSR), which can make predictions for the target few-shot task directly without the need for pre-training on the human curated set of training tasks. The key to CSR is that we explicitly model a shared connection subgraph between support and query triplets, as inspired by the principle of eliminative induction. To adapt to specific KG, we design a corresponding self-supervised pretraining scheme with the objective of reconstructing automatically sampled connection subgraphs. Our pretrained model can then be directly applied to target few-shot tasks on without the need for training few-shot tasks. Extensive experiments on real KGs, including NELL, FB15K-237, and ConceptNet, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework: we show that even a learning-free implementation of CSR can already perform competitively to existing methods on target few-shot tasks; with pretraining, CSR can achieve significant gains of up to 52% on the more challenging inductive few-shot tasks where the entities are also unseen during (pre)training. © 2022 Neural information processing systems foundation.

AB  - Information extraction from scholarly articles is a challenging task due to the sizable document length and implicit information hidden in text, figures, and citations. Scholarly information extraction has various applications in exploration, archival, and curation services for digital libraries and knowledge management systems. We present MORTY, an information extraction technique that creates structured summaries of text from scholarly articles. Our approach condenses the article’s full-text to property-value pairs as a segmented text snippet called structured summary. We also present a sizable scholarly dataset combining structured summaries retrieved from a scholarly knowledge graph and corresponding publicly available scientific articles, which we openly publish as a resource for the research community. Our results show that structured summarization is a suitable approach for targeted information extraction that complements other commonly used methods such as question answering and named entity recognition. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - There is an urgent need for preserving and making available the knowledge related to the history of computing, for research and education purposes. This is a peculiar kind of Cultural Heritage, since it tightly mixes hardware, software, documental and even immaterial heritage. The interlinks among these items and their context is fundamental to properly understand them and their role. Advanced AI techniques can support this vision and open unprecedented opportunities to the researchers, practitioners and hobbyists. We are pursuing these objectives in a project based the GraphBRAIN platform for Knowledge Graphs management. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - This paper introduces the ontological model for a FAIR digital library of music documents which takes into account a variety of music-related information, among which editorial information on documents and their production workflow as well as the score content and licensing information. The model is complemented with annotations (e.g. comments, fingering) on music documents produced by end-users, capable to add a social layer over the framework which enables the building of user-centric music applications. As a result, a machine-understandable knowledge graph of music content is defined, which can be queried, navigated and explored. On top of this, novel applications could be designed, like semantic workplaces where music scholars and musicians can find, analyse, compare, annotate and manipulate musical objects. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Third-party libraries with rich functionalities facilitate the fast development of JavaScript software, leading to the explosive growth of the NPM ecosystem. However, it also brings new security threats that vulnerabilities could be introduced through dependencies from third-party libraries. In particular, the threats could be excessively amplified by transitive dependencies. Existing research only considers direct dependencies or reasoning transitive dependencies based on reachability analysis, which neglects the NPM-specific dependency resolution rules as adapted during real installation, resulting in wrongly resolved dependencies. Consequently, further fine-grained analysis, such as precise vulnerability propagation and their evolution over time in dependencies, cannot be carried out precisely at a large scale, as well as deriving ecosystem-wide solutions for vulnerabilities in dependencies. To fill this gap, we propose a knowledge graph-based dependency resolution, which resolves the inner dependency relations of dependencies as trees (i.e., dependency trees), and investigates the security threats from vulnerabilities in dependency trees at a large scale. Specifically, we first construct a complete dependency-vulnerability knowledge graph (DVGraph) that captures the whole NPM ecosystem (over 10 million library versions and 60 million well-resolved dependency relations). Based on it, we propose a novel algorithm (DTResolver) to statically and precisely resolve dependency trees, as well as transitive vulnerability propagation paths, for each package by taking the official dependency resolution rules into account. Based on that, we carry out an ecosystem-wide empirical study on vulnerability propagation and its evolution in dependency trees. Our study unveils lots of useful findings, and we further discuss the lessons learned and solutions for different stakeholders to mitigate the vulnerability impact in NPM based on our findings. For example, we implement a dependency tree based vulnerability remediation method (DTReme) for NPM packages, and receive much better performance than the official tool (npm audit fix). © 2022 ACM.

AB  - Knowledge is the lifeblood for a plethora of applications such as search, recommender systems and natural language understanding. Thanks to the efforts in the fields of Semantic Web and Linked Open Data a growing number of interlinked knowledge bases are supporting the development of advanced knowledge-based applications. Unfortunately, for a large number of domain-specific applications, these knowledge bases are unavailable. In this paper, we present a resource consisting of a large knowledge graph linking the Italian cultural heritage entities (defined in the ArCo ontology) with the concepts defined on well-known knowledge bases (i.e., DBpedia and the Getty GVP ontology). We describe the methodologies adopted for the semi-automatic resource creation and provide an in-depth analysis of the resulting interlinked graph. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC-4.0.

AB  - BookSampo – Finnish Fiction Literature on the Semantic Web is a Linked Data (LD) service and portal deployed in 2011 by the Public Libraries of Finland with nearly 2 million annual users. However, BookSampo’s user interface (UI) on top of the underlying knowledge graph (KG) in a SPARQL endpoint has been created using traditional search and data exploration methods, and the full potential of the KG—8.74 million triples today—has not been fully utilized: the data, covers all Finnish fiction literature and beyond and is interesting from a Digital Humanities (DH) research perspective, too. This paper presents first results in creating a new BookSampo UI using faceted semantic search with data-analytic tools for Digital Humanities (DH) research, based on the Sampo Model and Sampo-UI framework. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Our approach integrates into a single knowledge graph both structured and unstructured textual data through a novel representation of multiple scientific documents. The Neo4j graph database is used for the representation of the proposed scientific knowledge graph. For the implementation of our approach, we use the Python programming language and the scikit-learn machine learning library. We assess our approach against classical link prediction algorithms using accuracy, recall and precision as our performance metrics. Our experiments achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the task of predicting future research collaborations. The experimentations reported in this chapter use the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In the fuzzy front stage of product conceptual design, requirements are often expressed briefly as the expectation of product effect. However, the mapping relationship between this kind of effect expectation requirement and product design knowledge is difficult to explore and establish, and it is more difficult to guide designing process objectively. In order to expand product conceptual design ideas, professionally search the design solution space, and improve user satisfaction, this article proposes product design knowledge and engineering parameter mapping technologies that support conceptual design: First, construct a domain knowledge graph based on patent text. Extract entities-such as effect knowledge, functional knowledge, technical knowledge, and structural knowledge-and inter-entity relationships from patent texts through BERT technology to realize the construction of domain knowledge graph; Second, in view of the fuzziness and incompleteness of the front stage design requirements, by introducing General Engineering Parameters (GEPs), construct the domain product-engineering parameter-structure (PGS) mapping relationship library. On the one hand, the library realizes the professional representation and completion of the product design requirements from the engineering perspective; on the other hand, it improves the mapping relationship between the difficult-to-identify relationships between design requirements and their structural solutions in the domain knowledge graph; Third, a product conceptual design process model based on PGS is proposed. The model takes the professional and complete requirements expressed as engineering parameters as input, which matches patent candidate sets through effect knowledge in the domain knowledge graph. Then select and construct a structural solution morphology matrix through computational evaluation methods to support the generation of product design conceptions; Finally, an example of manipulator design verifies the effectiveness of the knowledge library and the technical solution proposed by this research. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - In the last decade, the research on ancient civilizations has started to rely more and more on data science to extract knowledge on ancient societies from the written sources delivered from the past. In this paper, we combine two well-established frameworks: Linked Data to obtain a rich data structure, and Network Science to explore different research questions regarding the structure and the evolution of ancient societies. We propose a multi-disciplinary pipeline where, starting from a semantically annotated prosopographic archive, a research question is translated into a query on the archive and the obtained dataset is the input to the network model. We applied this pipeline to different archives, a Hittite and a Kassite collection of cuneiform tablets. Finally, network visualization is presented as a powerful tool to highlight both the data structure and the social network analysis results. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The Robot Operating System (ROS) has become the most popular robot development framework in the last few years, which has loosely coupled structure and provides remote communications between different component nodes. The ROS messages are critical to bridge the communication channels and clearly define the data structures. The developers can use the standardized or user-customized ROS message types to construct a communication channel between two component nodes uniquely. However, it becomes increasingly difficult for developers to find the required ROS message type from thousands of diverse ROS message types in ROS-based robotic software development. Finding the proper ROS message type is a non-trivial task because developers may hardly know the exact names of required ROS messages but only has a rough knowledge of the task domain features. To tackle this challenge, we construct a novel ROS Message Knowledge Graph (RMKG) with 4543 entities and 14320 relationships, including all ROS message types and message packages. We take the shortest path algorithm to search ROS message in RMKG by searching with ROS message feature or ROS message package and visualize the subgraph structure of the search results. Moreover, we develop a ROS message package library that supports fuzzy queries to find the required message package. A comprehensive evaluation of RMKG shows the high accuracy of our knowledge construction approach. A user study indicates that RMKG is promising in helping developers find suitable ROS message types for robotics software development tasks. An effect evaluation of message package fuzzy query shows the good effects of our fuzzy query method under different situations. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - To alleviate the common cold start problem in music recommendation scenarios, this paper proposes a personalized hybrid recommendation method based on Knowledge Graphs. The method constructs a music knowledge graph which is based on the Satori library and records of user-music interactions. At the same time, the approach will map the feature vectors of entities and relationships obtained from the knowledge graph into low-dimensional vectors. Moreover, through the operation of neighborhood aggregation, the local proximity structure is successfully captured and stored in each entity. The approach also explores users' preferences on the knowledge graph for recommender system. Finally, the final recommendation list is obtained based on the potential characteristics of music predicted by the CNN regression model. Comparing experiments on Last.FM demonstrate that this algorithm outperforms the traditional recommendation methods and knowledge graph-based methods, effectively mining the potential relationship between users and music and improving the quality of music recommendation. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Classical Chinese poetry has a history of thousands of years and is a precious cultural heritage of humankind. Compared with the modern Chinese corpus, it is irrecoverable and specially organized, making it difficult to be learned by existing pre-trained language models. Besides, with the thousands of years of development, many words in classical Chinese poetry have changed their meanings or been out of use today, which further limiting the capability of existing pre-trained models to learn the semantics of classical Chinese poetry. To address these challenges, we construct a large-scale sememe knowledge graph of classical Chinese Poetry (SKG-Poetry), which connects the vocabularies in classical Chinese poetry and modern Chinese. By extracting the sememe knowledge from classical Chinese poetry, our model PoetryBERT not only enlarges the irrecoverable pre-training corpus but also enriches the semantics of the vocabularies in classical Chinese poetry, which enables PoetryBERT to be successfully used in downstream tasks. Specifically, we evaluate our model in two tasks in the field of Chinese classical poetry, which are poetry theme classification and poetry-modern Chinese translation. Extensive experiments are conducted on the two tasks to show the effectiveness of sememe knowledge based pre-training model. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Faced with the ever-increasing number of scientific publications, researchers struggle to keep up, find and make sense of articles relevant to their own research. Scientific open archives play a central role in helping deal with this deluge, yet keyword-based search services often fail to grasp the richness of the semantic associations between articles. In this paper, we present the methods, tools and services implemented in the ISSA project to tackle these issues. The project aims to (1) provide a generic, reusable and extensible pipeline for the analysis and processing of articles of an open scientific archive, (2) translate the result into a semantic index stored and represented as an RDF knowledge graph; (3) develop innovative search and visualization services that leverage this index to allow researchers, decision makers or scientific information professionals to explore thematic association rules, networks of co-publications, articles with co-occurring topics, etc. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution, we also report on its deployment and user-driven customization for the needs of an institutional open archive of 110,000+ resources. Fully in line with the open science and FAIR dynamics, the presented work is available under an open license with all the accompanying documents necessary to facilitate its reuse. The knowledge graph produced on our use-case is compliant with common linked open data best practices. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The theory of "urban historical landscape"is gradually emerging in cultural heritage protection and urban planning in recent years. It was first proposed and promoted by UNESCO. In this study, the identification and evaluation are taken as the prerequisite for the protection and management of historical landscape. This paper uses CiteSpace to analyze the map of knowledge data to collect and sort out the global research status of urban historical landscape. In addition, the clustering function of knowledge graph software VOSviewer is used to analyze the knowledge clustering in the research field of urban historical landscape, and the research process and interdisciplinary development of urban historical landscape are obtained, to make some guiding suggestions for the future study of urban historical landscape. The results show that the study of urban historical landscape has experienced three stages. The early stage is the introduction and tracing stage, the middle stage is the diversification and enrichment stage, and the recent stage is the practice and construction stage. At present, it has become a multidisciplinary and multiperspective international research. The in-depth study of urban historical landscape undoubtedly opens a door for the traditional thought of urban heritage protection. At the same time, it gradually turned to more active management of urban historical landscape and also promoted the intersection of city, architecture, landscape architecture, anthropology, sociology, economics, and other disciplines from the side, with far-reaching influence. Reviewing and looking forward to studying urban historical landscape is more conducive to sustainable construction of the future. CiteSpace, as an excellent bibliometrics software, can help researchers sort out and display past research tracks in a novel visual way, to conduct future research better.  © 2022 Youping Teng et al.

AB  - In the World Wide Web, a very large number of online cultural heritage (CH) resources is made available through digital museums websites. They display collections images and share collection metadata, which makes opportunities for aggregating. 'China Art in the Museums Overseas' platform aggregated China digital collections from overseas institutions. This paper introduces the metadata aggregation workflow of this project, especially a unified data model used to solve the metadata standards heterogeneity. Besides, this platform is not simply a database, but also provides search, images semantic annotation, knowledge graph serves, linked open data interface and so on. Our work is an effort to resolve multi-source data aggregation and it is valuable. It improves the availability and discoverability of digital collections, and spread Chinese culture to the public more widely. © 2022 Dublin Core metadata initiative. All rights reserved.

AB  - The accurate search of professional knowledge in power dispatching systems, enterprise technical standards, and other power business documents is significant for power dispatching personnel to make decisions and improve work efficiency. The existing methods to solve the power search focused on paragraph search, few of which consider locating the question to the precise answer. This paper proposes an intelligent search method based on the combination of Elasticsearch and Knowledge Graph for power dispatching and equipment technology, which improves the accuracy of searching enterprise technical standard documents. This method is based on Elasticsearch to prefilter the contents of paragraphs and reduce the search scope. Further, in a small range of paragraph content, based on the knowledge graph of triples and problems to match fine granularity, to achieve the power enterprise technical standard documents intelligent accurate search. A real-world data set is used in the experiment, and the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, a prototype system for knowledge search of power grid dispatching system is constructed.

AB  - Graph databases are a straightforward technology for storing knowledge graphs. However, they are schema-less. We apply the GraphBRAIN Schema (GBS) format to describe Time-sensitive Linguistic Knowledge in a graph database (Neo4j). Our schema can model relations between concepts and words, information about word occurrences, and diachronic information about concepts and words. This paper introduces GraphBRAIN technology and describes our model for time-sensitive linguistic data. Moreover, we provide an example of usage and show the potential of this model for humanities and cultural heritage research. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - We present a new gold-standard dataset and a benchmark for the Research Theme Identification task, a sub-task of the Scholarly Knowledge Graph Generation shared task, at the 3rd Workshop on Scholarly Document Processing. The objective of the shared task was to label given research papers with research themes from a total of 36 themes. The benchmark was compiled using data drawn from the largest overall assessment of university research output ever undertaken globally (the Research Excellence Framework - 2014). We provide a performance comparison of a transformer-based ensemble, which obtains multiple predictions for a research paper, given its multiple textual fields (e.g. title, abstract, reference), with traditional machine learning models. The ensemble involves enriching the initial data with additional information from open-access digital libraries and Argumentative Zoning techniques (Teufel et al., 1999b). It uses a weighted sum aggregation for the multiple predictions to obtain a final single prediction for the given research paper. Both data and the ensemble are publicly available on https://www.kaggle.com/ and https://github.com/ProjectDoSSIER/sdp2022, respectively. © 2022 COLING. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Visual Question Answering (VQA) is gaining momentum for its ability of bridging Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. VQA approaches mainly rely on Machine Learning algorithms that need to be trained on large annotated datasets. Once trained, a machine learning model is barely portable on a different domain. This calls for agile methodologies for building large annotated datasets from existing resources. The cultural heritage domain represents both a natural application of this task and an extensive source of data for training and validating VQA models. To this end, by using data and models from ArCo, the knowledge graph of the Italian cultural heritage, we generated a large dataset for VQA in Italian and English. We describe the results and the lessons learned by our semi-automatic process for the dataset generation and discuss the employed tools for data extraction and transformation. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This paper presents μKG, an open-source Python library for representation learning over knowledge graphs. μKG supports joint representation learning over multi-source knowledge graphs (and also a single knowledge graph), multiple deep learning libraries (PyTorch and TensorFlow2), multiple embedding tasks (link prediction, entity alignment, entity typing, and multi-source link prediction), and multiple parallel computing modes (multi-process and multi-GPU computing). It currently implements 26 popular knowledge graph embedding models and supports 16 benchmark datasets. μKG provides advanced implementations of embedding techniques with simplified pipelines of different tasks. It also comes with high-quality documentation for ease of use. μKG is more comprehensive than existing knowledge graph embedding libraries. It is useful for a thorough comparison and analysis of various embedding models and tasks. We show that the jointly learned embeddings can greatly help knowledge-powered downstream tasks, such as multi-hop knowledge graph question answering. We will stay abreast of the latest developments in the related fields and incorporate them into μKG.

AB  - Knowledge Extraction (KE) techniques are used to convert unstructured information present in texts to Knowledge Graphs (KGs) which can be queried and explored. Despite their potential for cultural heritage domains, such as Art History, these techniques often encounter limitations if applied to domain-specific data. In this paper we present the main challenges that KE has to face on art-historical texts, by using as case study Giorgio Vasari's The Lives of The Artists. This paper discusses the following NLP tasks for art-historical texts, namely entity recognition and linking, coreference resolution, time extraction, motif extraction and artwork extraction. Several strategies to annotate art-historical data for these tasks and evaluate NLP models are also proposed. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Given a few seed entities of a certain type (e.g., Software or Programming Language), entity set expansion aims to discover an extensive set of entities that share the same type as the seeds. Entity set expansion in software-related domains such as StackOverflow can benefit many downstream tasks (e.g., software knowledge graph construction) and facilitate better IT operations and service management. Meanwhile, existing approaches are less concerned with two problems: (1) How to deal with multiple types of seed entities simultaneously? (2) How to leverage the power of pre-trained language models (PLMs)? Being aware of these two problems, in this paper, we study the entity set co-expansion task in StackOverflow, which extracts Library, OS, Application, and Language entities from StackOverflow question-answer threads. During the co-expansion process, we use PLMs to derive embeddings of candidate entities for calculating similarities between entities. Experimental results show that our proposed SECoExpan framework outperforms previous approaches significantly. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Among the ancient cities and ports of Tamil Nadu, India, Poompuhar is a historical and coastal port that emerged with the increasing maritime trade of the early Chola kingdom. The ancient trade town and the busy port of Poompuhar symbolize the Tamil culture and civilization up to 200 CE. The city was destroyed and washed away by big shore waves during AD 500. The submerged parts and scattered destruction remains have been identified in onshore and offshore excavations around the coastal lines of the Bay of Bengal in Tamil Nadu. Information on the port city can be found in various sources, such as archaeo-logical evidence, historical references, coastal erosion data and Sangam Tamil literature. Here, a methodology is pre-sented for a semantic representation of Poompuhar port city, integrating heterogeneous data to create a knowledge base by mapping and associating related entities. The knowledge base has been created using CIDOC CRM to represent Poompuhar events digitally. The experimental results of the ontology are verified exploring the submer-gence of Poompuhar use cases for onshore and offshore excavations through a knowledge graph. © 2022, Current Science.

AB  - Linking and visualizing multiple types of entities in a DH knowledge graph generates the need to deal with multiple types of data and media modalities both on the designer and the user side. The InTaVia project develops synoptic visual representations for a multimodal historical knowledge graph which draws together transnational data about cultural objects and historical actors. In this paper we reflect on the question how to integrate and mediate the informational and visual affordances of both kinds of cultural data with hybrid designs and show how a user-centered design process can help to ground the required selections and design choices in an empirical procedure.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Heritage institutions hold rich information on cultural heritage objects involving contextual information about people, places, times, and events. This information is usually kept in institutional silos, where domain researchers often work with data across institutions. Linking entities among different institutions can enrich these data sources and, in turn, aid domain research. The aggregated version of data can be further used to infer insightful knowledge that can excel in one of the time-consuming tasks of the domain, which is provenance research. This research will first focus on entity linking across institutions to construct a Knowledge Graph representing both structured metadata of objects and the collector's biography. This work aims to use this newly formed Knowledge Graph to find interesting patterns to scale-up provenance research and analyse the effect of adding such information to the current data source. Experiments with the different modalities of data and pattern mining techniques will reveal to which extent this data enrichment places a role in finding useful knowledge for the heritage objects' provenance research. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - This work presents frances, an integrated text mining tool that combines information extraction, knowledge graphs, NLP, deep learning, parallel processing and Semantic Web techniques to unlock the full value of historical digital textual collections, offering new capabilities for researchers to use powerful analysis methods without being distracted by the technology and middleware details. To demonstrate these capabilities, we use the first eight editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica offered by the National Library of Scotland (NLS) as an example digital collection to mine and analyse. We have developed novel parallel heuristics to extract terms from the original collection (alongside metadata), which provides a mix of unstructured and semi-structured input data, and populated a new knowledge graph with this information. Our Natural Language Processing models enable frances to perform advanced analyses that go significantly beyond simple search using the information stored in the knowledge graph. Furthermore, frances also allows for creating and running complex text mining analyses at scale. Our results show that the novel computational techniques developed within frances provide a vehicle for researchers to formalize and connect findings and insights derived from the analysis of large-scale digital corpora such as the Encyclopaedia Britannica.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Health and the initiation, progression, and outcome of disease are the result of multiple environmental factors interacting with individual genetic makeups. Collectively, results from primary clinical research on health and disease represent the most compendious and reliable source of actionable knowledge on strategies to optimize health. However, the dispersal of this information as unstructured data, distributed across millions of documents, is a substantial challenge in bridging the gap between primary research and concrete recommendations for improving health. Described here is the development and implementation of a machine reading pipeline that builds a knowledge graph of causal relationships between a broad range of predictive/modifiable diet and lifestyle factors and health outcomes, extracted from the vast biomedical corpus in the National Library of Medicine.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The Qiang people is an ancient minority in western China. However, Qiang language, as the carrier of Qiang culture and spirit, is rapidly fading as less and fewer people can speak it. Despite the fact that the serious game of indigenous language has been widely discussed, there is still a dearth of research on the Qiang language and culture. This research aims to determine the efficacy of serious games based on interactive projection to encourage people’s interest in Qiang language and culture. To better understand the Qiang language and cultural heritage’s current state and challenges, we conducted a three-day field investigation in the Qiang village. Based on the field study’s findings, we created “WhiteStone”, an interactive projection device based on the heroic epic of Qiang. Our user research consists of remote verification and user testing, indicating that serious games based on projected interaction have the potential to create engrossed and interesting experiences, which can attract young people’s interest in the Qiang language and culture. This paper examines the design opportunities for serious games based on interactive projection to revitalize the Qiang language and culture. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Background: Recent years are seeing a growing impetus in the semantification of scholarly knowledge at the fine-grained level of scientific entities in knowledge graphs. The Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG, orkg.org) represents an important step in this direction, with thousands of scholarly contributions as structured, fine-grained, machine-readable data. There is a need, however, to engender change in traditional community practices of recording contributions as unstructured, non-machine-readable text. For this in turn, there is a strong need for AI tools designed for scientists that permit easy and accurate semantification of their scholarly contributions. We present one such tool, ORKG-assays. Implementation: ORKG-assays is a freely available AI micro-service in ORKG written in Python designed to assist scientists obtain semantified bioassays as a set of triples. It uses an AI-based clustering algorithm which on gold-standard evaluations over 900 bioassays with 5,514 unique property-value pairs for 103 predicates shows competitive performance. Results and Discussion: As a result, semantified assay collections can be surveyed on the ORKG platform via tabulation or chart-based visualizations of key property values of the chemicals and compounds offering smart knowledge access to biochemists and pharmaceutical researchers in the advancement of drug development. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - More and more publishers tend to create and upload their data as digital open data, and this is also the case for the Cultural Heritage (CH) domain. For facilitating their Data Interchange, Integration, Preservation and Management, publishers tend to create their data as Linked Open Data (LOD) and connect them with existing LOD datasets that belong to the popular LOD Cloud, which contains over 1,300 datasets (including more than 150 datasets of CH domain). Due to the high amount of available LOD datasets, it is not trivial to find all the datasets having commonalities (e.g., common entities) with a given dataset at real time. However, it can be of primary importance for several tasks to connect these datasets, for being able to answer more queries and in a more complete manner (e.g., for better understanding our history), for enriching the information of a given entity (e.g., for a book, a historical person, an event), for estimating the veracity of data, etc. For this reason, we present a research prototype, called ConnectionChecker, which receives as input a LOD Dataset, computes and shows the connections to hundreds of LOD Cloud datasets through LODsyndesis knowledge graph, and offers several measurements, visualizations and metadata for the given dataset. We describe how one can exploit ConnectionChecker for their own dataset, and we provide use cases for the CH domain, by using two real linked CH datasets: a) a dataset from the National Library of Netherlands, and b) a dataset for World War I from the Universities of Aalto and Helsinki. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Knowledge reuse can increase the quality and efficiency of different activities, as well as reduce risks. The digital transformation of a city is a complex task that requires new approaches and management technologies. Knowledge reuse can reinforce city digital transformation initiatives, e.g. data integration and modeling activities can be improved via ontology reuse, design and development of digital solutions can be enhanced via reference architectures and reuse of existing methods and systems. Such reuse can speed up the work of city development managers, digital architects, and other ICT specialists, as well as decrease costs and risks. Although there are platforms for knowledge sharing and reuse within the smart city domain, they apply a traditional document-oriented approach to knowledge representation. This limits knowledge integration and the creation of intelligent services. So, knowledge graph technology was selected for collecting and curating digital city planning reusable content. The Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) provided an opportunity for piloting this approach. The current paper will overview the digital city planning observatory within the ORKG, including main knowledge representation mechanisms and representative content examples, and provide the link between content and application scenarios. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Since its first formalization, the Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) field has shown diverse extensions of the FCA paradigm. A recent example is Graph-FCA, an extension of FCA to graphs. In the context of Graph-FCA, a notion of concept of neighbors has been introduced to support a form of nearest neighbor search over the nodes of a graph. Concepts of neighbors have been used for diverse tasks, such as knowledge graph completion and relation classification in texts. In this paper, we present CONNOR, a Java library for the computation of concepts of neighbors on RDF graphs. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Knowledge can play an important role in ascertaining an organization’s competitive edge if the knowledge of employees is nurtured and utilized as an asset with a potential to improve service delivery. The study focused on knowledge sharing at the Thomas Mofolo Library in Lesotho to determine if knowledge sharing was being used to improve service delivery at the library. A case study design that triangulated interviews and questionnaires was used in this study. Quantitative data was processed using software packages. Data from the interviews was analyzed through content analysis based on the objectives of the study. This study established that staff recognized the need to share knowledge. However, knowledge sharing occurred on an ad hoc basis. There was a limited use of technology-based and human-based mechanisms of sharing knowledge. The study suggests practical knowledge-sharing practices that may contribute to improved service delivery in a library setup. As a case study, the study may also contribute to the development of theory about the phenomenon. © 2022 IGI Global. All rights reserved.

AB  - The development of digital technology promotes the construction of the Intangible cultural heritage (ICH) database but the data is still unorganized and not linked well, which makes the public hard to master the overall knowledge of the ICH. An ICH knowledge graph (KG) can help the public to understand the ICH and facilitate the protection of the ICH. However, a general framework of ICH KG construction is lacking now. In this study, we take the Chinese ICH (nation-level) as an example and propose a framework to build a Chinese ICH KG combining multiple data sources from Baike and the official website, which can extend the scale of the KG. Besides, the data of ICH grows daily, requiring us to design an efficient model to extract the knowledge from the data to update the KG in time. The built KG is based on the triple 〈entity, attribute, attribute value〉 and we introduce the attribute value extraction (AVE) task. However, the public Chinese ICH annotated AVE corpus is lacking. To solve that, we construct a Chinese ICH AVE corpus based on the Distant Supervision (DS) automatically rather than employing traditional manual annotation. Currently, AVE is usually seen as the sequence tagging task. In this paper, we take the ICH AVE as a node classification task and propose an AVE model BGC, combining the BiLSTM and graph attention network, which can fuse and utilize the word-level and character-level information by means of the ICH lexicon generated from the KG. We conduct extensive experiments and compare the proposed model with other state-of-the-art models. Experimental results show that the proposed model is of superiority. © 2021

AB  - In this paper, we describe our recent findings in interlinking the ArCo Italian cultural heritage entities to the well known Getty Art and Architecture (GVP) Thesaurus through the automated extraction of candidate entities from textual descriptions and the subsequent pruning of ambiguous out-of-domain entities using Neural Word Sense Disambiguation. The disambiguation task is particularly complex since, as detailed in this paper, we map Italian entities in the Arco cultural heritage onto lexical concepts in English (such as those in the GVP Thesaurus). To date, the majority of entity linking and word sense disambiguation systems are designed to work with English and to operate with general purpose sense inventories and knowledge bases, such as DBpedia, BabelNet and WordNet. To address this challenging entity linking and disambiguation task, we adapted a state-of-the-art Neural Word Sense Disambiguation to work in this multi-language setting. We here describe our adaptation process and discuss preliminary experimental results. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - RDF Knowledge graphs are semantic networks to infer information from data based on RDF triples using SPARQL queries. Querying RDF Knowledge graphs using visualization allows different views of the graph and provides more insights. A new visualization tool, KG-Visual is developed in this paper using Python dashboard, JavaScript and RDF libraries. This tool tackles the limitations of existing tools by providing a customizable and reliable visualization for RDF knowledge graphs. In addition to the essential functionalities such as search, drag and drop nodes, zoom-in and zoom-out over a knowledge graph, the tool holds the capability to run SPARQL queries and visualize the results on the knowledge graph, which makes this open-source tool a potential candidate amongst most RDF visualization tools. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - To give a quick idea of a knowledge graph content, it is usual to show the classes and properties it instantiates. However, controlled vocabulary's terms can also inform about its content, as much as the classes and properties. We present a study on the role and the place of these terms in knowledge graphs, in particular those designed with the CIDOC CRM.We explain the difficulties of finding them automatically. We identify simple queries to do it, we propose a more complex one, and we present experimental results on SPARQL access points, in the cultural heritage domain. Those results show that... the question remains open. © 2022 IC 2022 - 33es Journees Francophones d'Ingenierie des Connaissances.All rights reserved.

AB  - Research knowledge graphs allow the enrichment of large amounts of data. Still, in some fields like the humanities sources are distributed in small archives not connected by the large research knowledge graphs or hubs like Wikidata. In comparison to these large research knowledge graphs, light-weight knowledge graphs allow the creation of small-scale hubs within the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud as well as the re-usage of larger hubs like Wikidata in order to enrich one’s own data. This paper describes the potentials of research knowledge graphs for interlinking archives and data hubs offering an overarching systematic overview to topic related distributed data. The potentials of the graph technology are shown in action for a concrete case in the field of history of education, focusing on school archives. Also, the research knowledge graph enables archivists and researchers to annotate and enrich the graph in order to customize it to their needs and research interests. It also facilitates processing of the heterogeneously structured data from larger hubs in order to increase coverage of the graph. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Besides third-party packages, the Python interpreter and system libraries are also critical dependencies of a Python program. In our empirical study, 34% programs are only compatible with specific Python interpreter versions, and 24% programs require specific system libraries. However, existing techniques mainly focus on inferring third-party package dependencies. Therefore, they can lack other necessary dependencies and violate version constraints, thus resulting in program build failures and runtime errors. This paper proposes a knowledge-based technique named PyEGo, which can automatically infer dependencies of third-party packages, the Python interpreter, and system libraries at compatible versions for Python programs. We first construct the dependency knowl-edge graph PyKG, which can portray the relations and constraints among third-party packages, the Python interpreter, and system libraries. Then, by querying PyKG with extracted program features, PyEGo constructs a program-related sub-graph with dependency candidates of the three types. It finally outputs the latest compatible dependency versions by solving constraints in the sub-graph. We evaluate PyEGo on 2,891 single-file Python gists, 100 open-source Python projects and 4,836 jupyter notebooks. The experimental re-sults show that PyEGo achieves better accuracy, 0.2x to 3.5x higher than the state-of-the-art approaches. © 2022 ACM.

AB  - An important problem in large symbolic music collections is the low availability of high-quality metadata, which is essential for various information retrieval tasks. Traditionally, systems have addressed this by relying either on costly human annotations or on rule-based systems at a limited scale. Recently, embedding strategies have been exploited for representing latent factors in graphs of connected nodes. In this work, we propose MIDI2vec, a new approach for representing MIDI files as vectors based on graph embedding techniques. Our strategy consists of representing the MIDI data as a graph, including the information about tempo, time signature, programs and notes. Next, we run and optimise node2vec for generating embeddings using random walks in the graph. We demonstrate that the resulting vectors can successfully be employed for predicting the musical genre and other metadata such as the composer, the instrument or the movement. In particular, we conduct experiments using those vectors as input to a Feed-Forward Neural Network and we report good comparable accuracy scores in the prediction with respect to other approaches relying purely on symbolic music, avoiding feature engineering and producing highly scalable and reusable models with low dimensionality. Our proposal has real-world applications in automated metadata tagging for symbolic music, for example in digital libraries for musicology, datasets for machine learning, and knowledge graph completion. © 2022-The authors.

AB  - The existing intangible cultural heritage knowledge exists in different data formats such as structured, semi-structured and unstructured. It is stored in a variety of ways and cannot be used effectively. How to reasonably store intangible cultural heritage knowledge, improve the singleness of knowledge form, better retrieve knowledge and provide relevant services have become the main problems. In order to alleviate these problems, this paper constructs the intangible cultural heritage knowledge graph (KG), which provides a set of KG construction paradigm for the intangible cultural heritage field. The intangible cultural heritage knowledge is crawled by the crawler, stored in the graph database, and the intelligent question answering (IQA) system is realized by using the matching algorithm. The intangible cultural heritage KG spectrum is successfully constructed. The results show that the method proposed in this paper is effective and has certain scalability and popularization.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Image-based retrieval in large Earth observation archives is difficult, because one needs to navigate across thousands of candidate matches only with the proposition image as a guide. By using text as a query language, the retrieval system gains in usability, but at the same time faces difficulties due to the diversity of visual signals that cannot be summarized by a short caption only. For this reason, as a matching-based task, cross-modal text-image retrieval often suffers from information asymmetry between texts and images. To address this challenge, we propose a Knowledge-aware Cross-modal Retrieval (KCR) method for remote sensing text-image retrieval. By mining relevant information from an external knowledge graph, KCR enriches the text scope available in the search query and alleviates the information gaps between texts and images for better matching. Experimental results on two commonly used remote sensing text-image retrieval benchmarks show that the proposed knowledge-aware method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - OBO library ontologies include a wealth of inter-ontology semantic links, which require OWL reasoning to utilize fully. Merging and reasoning over a large suite of ontologies is resource intensive, and challenging for many users. Here we present Ubergraph, an RDF triplestore and public SPARQL query endpoint, which includes a novel approach to precomputing OWL inferences, stored in a readily traversable knowledge graph. Ubergraph’s “relation graphs” allow users to perform SPARQL queries which make use of the semantics of the included ontologies. Ubergraph currently includes 39 OBO library ontologies. We describe several use cases enabled by Ubergraph such as ontology browsing and entailment validation. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - This paper will review the progresses done at the University of Cagliari on the exploitation of free text corpora in order to extract structured information that can be then queried using both standard and advanced querying techniques. Unsupervised techniques to induce knowledge graphs (entity, relations, ontological hierarchies) from untagged text, including ad-hoc tasks (such as set expansion, relation extraction, etc.) available in our python library OKgraph will be discussed. We will also discuss advanced techniques that have been developed to query such structured data, including the use of natural language via Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) and the so-called By-Example Structured (BESt) Queries, developed in collaboration with UCLA. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Digital Storytelling can exploit numerous technologies and sources of information to support the creation, refinement and enhancement of a narrative. Research on text editing tools has created novel interactions that support authors in different stages of the creative process, such as the inclusion of crowd-generated content for writing. While these interactions have the potential to change workflows, integration of these in a way that is useful and matches users’ needs is unclear. In order to investigate the space of Assisted Storytelling, we designed and conducted a study to analyze how users write and edit a story about Cultural Heritage using an auxiliary source like Wikipedia. Through a diffractive analysis of stories, creative processes, and social and cultural contexts, we reflect and derive implications for design. These were applied to develop an AI-supported text editing tool using crowd-sourced content from Wikipedia and Wikidata. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - As an important carrier of color culture costumes are a epitome of multiple cultural factors such as national culture, mass psychology, historical background and social environment, and the color of costumes embodies the process of change and development of traditional Chinese philosophical thought and aesthetic views. Today, with the rapid development of digital technology and the emphasis on cultural ideology, the study of colors has gradually moved away from the mere analysis of natural scientific principles to focus more on the underlying national traditions and cultural connotations. The Qing Dynasty was the end of China' s feudal dynasty and the traditional costumes of the Qing Dynasty, influenced by the mutual absorption of multiple ethnic cultures were characterized by rich and colorful ornamentation and exquisite craftsmanship occupying an important place in the history of Chinese costumes. The color palette of the Qing Dynasty not only embodies the traditional "five elements and five colors" that have been passed down through the ages but also provides a constant source of inspiration and color matching for contemporary designers today. The Qing Dynasty drama Yanxi Raiders is popular with viewers for its color palette but many audiences are misled by commercial account media into mistaking the " Morandi colors" for the " Qianlong colors". When faced with a vast amount of cultural knowledge designers are prone to under-absorb and under-transform often resulting in the blind use of color and a lack of cultural connotation in their design work. This paper aims to dig into the knowledge content of the color setting rules of traditional Qing Dynasty costumes for the purpose of color application for designers, and to digitize and visualize the knowledge. The data from the Qing Dynasty costume collections in the Palace Museum and the Museum of Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology are selected as the data set for the study from the perspectives of reliability quality authority and comprehensiveness of the data sources and a database of Qing Dynasty costume colors is constructed. Adopting the methodology of the color system the study compares the color name records color design causes color performance and aesthetic characteristics of the Qing Dynasty costumes in terms of both material and immaterial colors based on the records and descriptions in classic Qing Dynasty cultural texts and modern costume color studies. By summarizing and analyzing the cultural connotations and aesthetic values it provides a knowledge structure and content reserve for the digitalization and visualization of a cultural database on the color scheme of the Qing Dynasty costumes. Finally, by analyzing the needs of designers in terms of knowledge acquisition knowledge analysis and knowledge application and combining the common visualization forms of intangible cultural heritage databases an interactive knowledge visualization platform based on the visualization form of knowledge mapping is constructed for the color scheme of the Qing Dynasty costumes. Through the visual mapping designers can obtain information on the cultural imagery chronological background people occasions of use institutions of origin color characteristics and decorative techniques of color application from the knowledge of the color scheme of the Qing Dynasty costumes so as to better realize the modern transformation of traditional color culture. This paper constructs a designer-oriented approach to the study of traditional costume color culture. By studying the cultural connotations and expressive characteristics of traditional color culture it helps designers to organize the color culture of the Qing Dynasty costumes and form a knowledge base of color setting laws making up for the lack of cultural connotations of color in color design. A knowledge base on the color schemes of the Qing Dynasty costumes is constructed and the types of entities suitable for a traditional costume color culture knowledge base are defined. The data from the Qing Dynasty traditional costume collection which are currently from official and reliable sources and of good quality are collected and collated and the picture data and knowledge text are combined and analyzed dialectically to form a diversified data structure and knowledge system which facilitates the management and analysis of knowledge. Based on the visual form of knowledge mapping the construction of a digital platform for designer applications is explored. Traditional knowledge mapping is highly professional and low in interactivity. By analyzing the interaction habits and needs of designers this paper carries out the interaction design of the platform from four levels aiming to help designers better access analyze and apply data. There is a huge amount of documentation involved in the color culture of the Qing Dynasty costumes and the objects selected for study in this paper still have certain limitations. In this paper we select the collections of two typical museums as image resources take into consideration the classic historical texts and classic literary works of the Qing Dynasty and take the literature on Qing Dynasty costume color studies as cross-references aiming to compare the textual information with image resources and strengthen the connection between knowledge and links. However we only select typical cultural objects for regular analysis and summarization which is still not enough to cover the entire cultural knowledge of the costumes and colors of the Qing Dynasty and there is still room for complementary knowledge comprehensiveness and quantitative expansion of content. © 2022 China Silk Association.

AB  - In recent years, considerable efforts have been made by cultural heritage institutions across the globe to digitise cultural heritage sites, artifacts, historical maps, etc. for digital preservation and online representation. On the other hand, ample research projects and studies have been published that demonstrate the great capabilities of web-geographic information systems (web-GIS) for the dissemination and online representation of cultural heritage data. However, cultural heritage data and the associated metadata produced by many cultural heritage institutions are hetero-geneous. To make this heterogeneous data more interoperable and structured, an ever-growing number of cultural heritage institutions are adopting linked data principles. Although the cultural heritage domain has already started implementing linked open data concepts to the cultural heritage data, there are not many research articles that present an easy-to-implement, free, and open-source-based web-GIS architecture that integrates 3D digital cultural heritage models with cloud computing and linked open data. Furthermore, the integration of web-GIS technologies with 3D web-based visualisation and linked open data may offer new dimensions of interaction and exploration of digital cultural heritage. To demonstrate the high potential of integration of these technol-ogies, this study presents a novel cloud architecture that attempts to enhance digital cultural heritage exploration by integrating 3D digital cultural heritage models with linked open data from DBpedia and GeoNames platforms using web-GIS technologies. More specifically, a digital interactive map, 3D digital cultural heritage models, and linked open data from DBpedia and GeoNames platforms were integrated into a cloud-based web-GIS architecture. Thus, the users of the architecture can easily interact with the digital map, visualise 3D digital cultural heritage models, and ex-plore linked open data from GeoNames and DBpedia platforms, which offer additional information and context related to the selected cultural heritage site as well as external web resources. The architecture was validated by applying it to specific case studies of Australian cultural heritage and seeking expert feedback on the system, its benefits, and scope for improvement in the near future. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - We present the Lohengrin TimeMachine web application, consisting of video and textual musicological essays supported by an interactive digital companion. The digital companion allows a user to browse and compare all the occurrences of a motive in the opera Lohengrin, viewing them by text, vocal score and orchestration, with detailed views, segment labelling, audio excerpts and textual commentaries supporting the exploration. The video and essay modes show live links into the companion as the viewer or reader progresses through the narrative. This application is built on Linked Data technology and demonstrates the viability of such an approach, with the knowledge graph being traversed in the user's browser to gather the materials for display. It uses the Music Encoding and Linked Data (MELD) framework, which provides the basis for a range of music-related Linked Data applications. In this paper, we describe and illustrate the application in use, its technological underpinnings, as well as the motivation and implementation experience.  © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Cultural heritage institutions are exploring Semantic Web technologies to publish and enrich their catalogues. Several initiatives, such as Labs, are based on the creative and innovative reuse of the materials published by cultural heritage institutions. In this way, quality has become a crucial aspect to identify and reuse a dataset for research. In this article, we propose a methodology to create Shape Expressions definitions in order to validate LOD datasets published by libraries. The methodology was then applied to four use cases based on datasets published by relevant institutions. It intends to encourage institutions to use ShEx to validate LOD datasets as well as to promote the reuse of LOD, made openly available by libraries. © 2023-The authors. Published by IOS Press.

AB  - In this Chapter, we present an Ontology Design Pattern for representing situations that recur at regular periods and share some invariant factors, which unify them conceptually: we refer to this set of recurring situations as recurrent situation series. The proposed pattern appears to be foundational, since it can be generalised for modelling the top-level domain-independent concept of recurrence, which is strictly associated with invariance. The pattern reuses other foundational patterns such as Collection, Description and Situation, Classification, Sequence. Indeed, a recurrent situation series is formalised as both a collection of situations occurring regularly over time and unified according to some properties that are common to all the members, and a situation itself, which provides a relational context to its members that satisfy a reference description. Besides including some exemplifying instances of this pattern, we show how it has been implemented and specialised to model recurrent cultural events and ceremonies in ArCo, the Knowledge Graph of Italian cultural heritage. © 2021 The authors, AIT Austrian Institute of Technology and IOS Press.

AB  - [Objective] This study proposes a new term extraction model for the intangible heritage (traditional drama), which also helps us construct a term database. [Methods] First, we analyzed the drama language characteristics from term category, semantic structure, and text length perspectives. Then, we added part of speech and domain features to the character representation obtained by the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model. Finally, we incorporated the graph convolutional network (GCN) to the new model and captured the constraint relationship of the distant words. [Results] The F1 value of the proposed model reached 91.11%, which was 1.3 percentage points higher than the baseline BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model. [Limitations] We only retrieved the experimental data from Baidu Baike and the official website of Intangible Cultural Heritage, which should have included more free texts from other sources, more categories of drama terms, as well as the external features. [Conclusions] The proposed model and the database for traditional drama terms will help us construct the knowledge graph for traditional drama. © 2021, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - What is the thermal conductivity of copper? This straightforward question leads to a fascinating instance of the production of scientific facts through documentation practices. Ho, Powell and Liley's 1974 The Thermal Conductivity of the Elements: A Comprehensive Review is examined as an artifact of scientific reference data production, and its answer to the initial question is traced to modern-day search engine results. A short history of the Center that produced the book and some initial research into its authors is provided. Kuhn's concepts of normal science and normic lexical structures are utilized to clarify the Comprehensive Review's functioning within the broader scientific fields in which it is utilized. Bowker's concepts of memory practices and the jussive Archive help identify the forgetting embedded in the production of reference data, producing what Star called global certainty. Far from impugning the internal validity of these scientific facts, this forgetting is shown to be licensed by scientific rigor. This paper presents a novel historically informed investigation of how documentation practices produce scientific facts, and connect these activities to modern-day knowledge graph information retrieval. The theoretical analyses provided show how scientifically licensed forgetting is a key mechanism of fact production, what Hayles termed constrained constructivism.

AB  - In this article we introduce our semantic modeling approach for data from over 50 years of excavations at Tell el-Daba in Egypt. The CIDOC CRM with some of its extensions is used as an ontological framework to provide the semantics for creating a knowledge graph containing material remains, excavated areas, and documentation resources. An objective of the project A Puzzle in 4D is to digitize the documentation and create metadata for analog and digital resources in order to provide the data to the research community and facilitate future work for this important archaeological site. Using an example of 3D reconstruction of a tomb, we show how the knowledge graph linked to digital resources can be exploited for a specific task to encounter available information that is essential for a virtual reconstruction. Moreover, we show an approach of modeling to represent the interpretations supporting reconstructions as well as relate them to the sources used, thus providing transparency for the model and provenance data. Modeling for excavation documentation as well as virtual reconstruction has been tailored to the large amount of data processed from the project. The goal is to propose a semantic modeling feasible even on a large scale while still preserving the basic underlying ontological structures.  © 2021 ACM.

AB  - With the development of graph databases, organizations can utilize this technology to enhance human capital allocation by better understanding and connecting employee skillsets with the requirements of positions. Specifically, by storing data in the form of a knowledge graph, organizations are enabled to profile the competencies of their employees and optimize the deployment of human capital to the company's objectives. This study explores data provided by a large engineering organization which merges employee data, including project assignment and skills, with a public library of competency profiles from O∗NET. The objective is to explore employee skills profiling, optimize project staffing, and identify employees best suited for upskilling through the use of graph databases and machine learning algorithms. The findings show that knowledge graphs present an opportunity for organizations to better understand their workforces and more optimally allocate and strengthen their human capital.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Using the “ICH Light” metadata model created for the QueryLab portal, we sought to collect data from different archives, harvesting and storing it from a minimal set of information, with the goal of designing a discovery section to facilitate data search and retrieval. This paper will describe the activities and problems faced while modeling the common data structure implemented aimed to design a new and extensible one, defining a format that also opens towards the Linked Open Data environment. Starting from the analysis of similar experiences applied to museum data, we studied how to apply the Europeana Data Model (EDM) classes and focused on the specific entities designed to express the intangible cultural heritage described by the CHDE model (Cultural Heritage in Digital Environments), which provides a solution using the concept of Instantiation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This work aims to normalize the NlpContributions scheme (henceforward, NlpContributionGraph) to structure, directly from article sentences, the contributions information in Natural Language Processing (NLP) scholarly articles via a two-stage annotation methodology: 1) pilot stage - to define the scheme (described in prior work); and 2) adjudication stage - to normalize the graphing model (the focus of this paper). We re-annotate, a second time, the contributions-pertinent information across 50 prior-annotated NLP scholarly articles in terms of a data pipeline comprising: contribution-centered sentences, phrases, and triple statements. To this end, specifically, care was taken in the adjudication annotation stage to reduce annotation noise while formulating the guidelines for our proposed novel NLP contributions structuring and graphing scheme. The application of NlpContributionGraph on the 50 articles resulted finally in a dataset of 900 contribution-focused sentences, 4,702 contribution-information-centered phrases, and 2,980 surface-structured triples. The intra-annotation agreement between the first and second stages, in terms of F1-score, was 67.92% for sentences, 41.82% for phrases, and 22.31% for triple statements indicating that with increased granularity of the information, the annotation decision variance is greater. NlpContributionGraph has limited scope for structuring scholarly contributions compared with STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Medicine) scholarly knowledge at large. Further, the annotation scheme in this work is designed by only an intra-annotator consensus - a single annotator first annotated the data to propose the initial scheme, following which, the same annotator reannotated the data to normalize the annotations in an adjudication stage. However, the expected goal of this work is to achieve a standardized retrospective model of capturing NLP contributions from scholarly articles. This would entail a larger initiative of enlisting multiple annotators to accommodate different worldviews into a "single"set of structures and relationships as the final scheme. Given that the initial scheme is first proposed and the complexity of the annotation task in the realistic timeframe, our intra-annotation procedure is well-suited. Nevertheless, the model proposed in this work is presently limited since it does not incorporate multiple annotator worldviews. This is planned as future work to produce a robust model. We demonstrate NlpContributionGraph data integrated into the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), a next-generation KG-based digital library with intelligent computations enabled over structured scholarly knowledge, as a viable aid to assist researchers in their day-to-day tasks. NlpContributionGraph is a novel scheme to annotate research contributions from NLP articles and integrate them in a knowledge graph, which to the best of our knowledge does not exist in the community. Furthermore, our quantitative evaluations over the two-stage annotation tasks offer insights into task difficulty.  © 2021 2021 Jennifer D'Souza et al., published by Sciendo.

AB  - Cultural heritage institutions store and digitize large amounts of multimedia data inside archives to make archival records findable by archivists, scientists, and general public. Cataloging standards vary from archive to archive and, therefore, the sharing and use of this data are limited. To solve this issue, linked open data (LOD) is rising as an essential paradigm to open and provide access to the archival resources. Archives which are opened to the world knowledge benefit from external connections by enabling the application of automated approaches to process archival records, helping all stakeholders to gain valuable insights. In this paper, we present the Archive Dynamics Ontology (ArDO) - an ontology designed for describing the hierarchical nature of archival multimedia data, as well as its application on the example of archival resources about the Weimar Republic. Furthermore, ArDO semantically organizes multimedia archival resources in form of texts, images, audios, and videos by representing the dynamics related to their classification over time. ArDO tracks the changes of a specific hierarchical classification schema referred to as systematics adopted to organize archival resources under semantically defined keywords. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Traditional UBC provides for the standardization of bibliographic records, the creation of guidelines dedicated to national bibliographic agencies, the creation of the UNIMARC format, and the curation of authority data. Bibliographic Control has deeply evolved since IFLA theorization during the Seventies of the XX Century, due to the availability of a very large range of new bibliographic tools. At the beginning of the XXI century, UBC is quite different and involves new actors. Among these, Wikidata has a background greatly different from that of libraries as institutions: it is not devoted to bibliographic data, nor it is limited to personal authority control, but its value in AC tools like VIAF and National Libraries authority files is undiscussed. After a presentation on how Wikidata items describe and identify bibliographic entities, the authors underline how the existence, use and reuse of Wikidata affect the way the professional community thinks about UBC. Wikidata is a clear example of the need for a new approach to identification and description, that are deeply intertwined. Secondly, from a Wikidata perspective, the relevance of globally preferred and variant access points is lessened. Moreover, descriptions in Wikidata – although conceptually very similar to the traditional one – present differences and potentialities that a traditional description does not have and cannot have. Also from a theoretical perspective, Wikidata offers a pragmatic way to think globally and act locally. In fact, it shows that there is no need for one standardization of practices for establishing the headings and structure of authority records in one international form; instead, users’ convenience can be achieved by a technological infrastructure capable to present to each user the information about an entity in its own language and script. Additionally, Wikidata is the most evident example of the distributed and diffused approach of the semantic web to the issue of the universal identification of the entities. Also, Wikidata identification and description show that authority and bibliographic control must be tackled as just a part of the more general topic of the creation of a knowledge graph of all human knowledge by means of linked open data. Lastly, this objective cannot be achieved only by contribution, cooperation, and networking of large national agencies (as in VIAF), as a larger number of stakeholders must be involved to achieve a UBC also including the full indexing of any kind of scientific communication © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Biology has changed radically in the past two decades, growing from a purely descriptive science into also a design science. The availability of tools that enable the precise modification of cells, as well as the ability to collect large amounts of multimodal data, open the possibility of sophisticated bioengineering to produce fuels, specialty and commodity chemicals, materials, and other renewable bioproducts. However, despite new tools and exponentially increasing data volumes, synthetic biology cannot yet fulfill its true potential due to our inability to predict the behavior of biological systems. Here, we showcase a set of computational tools that, combined, provide the ability to store, visualize, and leverage multiomics data to predict the outcome of bioengineering efforts. We show how to upload, visualize, and output multiomics data, as well as strain information, into online repositories for several isoprenol-producing strain designs. We then use these data to train machine learning algorithms that recommend new strain designs that are correctly predicted to improve isoprenol production by 23%. This demonstration is done by using synthetic data, as provided by a novel library, that can produce credible multiomics data for testing algorithms and computational tools. In short, this paper provides a step-by-step tutorial to leverage these computational tools to improve production in bioengineered strains. © Copyright © 2021 Roy, Radivojevic, Forrer, Marti, Jonnalagadda, Backman, Morrell, Plahar, Kim, Hillson and Garcia Martin.

AB  - Graph is a natural data structure for describing complex systems, which contains a set of objects and relationships. Ubiquitous real-life biomedical problems can be modeled as graph analytics tasks. Machine learning, especially deep learning, succeeds in vast bioinformatics scenarios with data represented in Euclidean domain. However, rich relational information between biological elements is retained in the non-Euclidean biomedical graphs, which is not learning friendly to classic machine learning methods. Graph representation learning aims to embed graph into a low-dimensional space while preserving graph topology and node properties. It bridges biomedical graphs and modern machine learning methods and has recently raised widespread interest in both machine learning and bioinformatics communities. In this work, we summarize the advances of graph representation learning and its representative applications in bioinformatics. To provide a comprehensive and structured analysis and perspective, we first categorize and analyze both graph embedding methods (homogeneous graph embedding, heterogeneous graph embedding, attribute graph embedding) and graph neural networks. Furthermore, we summarize their representative applications from molecular level to genomics, pharmaceutical and healthcare systems level. Moreover, we provide open resource platforms and libraries for implementing these graph representation learning methods and discuss the challenges and opportunities of graph representation learning in bioinformatics. This work provides a comprehensive survey of emerging graph representation learning algorithms and their applications in bioinformatics. It is anticipated that it could bring valuable insights for researchers to contribute their knowledge to graph representation learning and future-oriented bioinformatics studies. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This chapter investigates the roles of embodied experience and experienced language use as motivating factors in the emergence of an open set of closely related and partially conventionalized figurative expressions: up to one's eyes in debt, up to one's ears in a mess, etc. The case study reported analyzes 276 instantiations of the low-level construction [up to X N: body-part, poss. in Y N: mass], also referred to here as the “immersion schema”. The multimodal data are randomly taken from U.S. television as documented in the UCLA Newscape Archive, a component of the RedHen Lab, and accessed via the Erlangen corpus NewsScape English v.5. To investigate dominant usage patterns, the case study employs an adapted “covarying collexeme analysis” capturing the co-varying lexical meanings contributed by X and Y. This is complemented by coarse-grained analyses of 54 co-speech gestures in the corpus data that are co-expressive with instantiations of the immersion schema. Identifying two major subschemas, the case study shows how figurative, i.e. metonymical and metaphorical, instantiations of the immersion schema draw on the conceptual and formal framework provided by formally identical 'literal' instantiations verbalizing actual bodily immersion experiences. To capture the relations in this network of instantiations and account for the productivity of the schema - especially the variation and creativity to be observed with its figurative instantiations - the chapter introduces the dynamic, usage- and construction-based notion of “idiom set”. © 2022 John Benjamins Publishing Company.

AB  - Anomalies such as redundant, inconsistent, contradictory, and deficient values in a knowledge graph are unavoidable, as such graphs are often curated manually, or extracted using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. Therefore, anomaly detection in knowledge graphs is an essential task that contributes towards its quality. Although there are approaches to detect anomalies in knowledge graphs, they are either domain dependent, not scalable to large graphs, or they require substantial human intervention. In this preliminary research paper we propose a novel unsupervised feature-based approach to anomaly detection in knowledge graphs. We first characterize triples in a directed edge-labelled knowledge graph using a set of binary features, and then use a one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify these triples as normal or abnormal. After selecting the features that have the highest consistency with the SVM outcomes, we provide a visualization of the identified anomalies, and the list of anomalous triples, thus supporting non-technical domain experts to understand the anomalies present in a knowledge graph. We evaluate our approach on the four knowledge graphs YAGO-1, KBpedia, Wikidata, and DSKG. This evaluation demonstrates that our approach is well suited to identify anomalies in knowledge graphs in an unsupervised manner, independent from the domain of the knowledge graph being evaluated. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Convolutional neural networks raised the bar for machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, mainly due to the abundance of data and computations. However, there is not always enough data for training, especially when it comes to historical collections of cultural heritage where the original artworks have been destroyed or damaged over time. Transfer Learning and domain adaptation techniques are possible solutions to tackle the issue of data scarcity. This article presents a new method for domain adaptation based on Knowledge graph embeddings. Knowledge Graph embedding forms a projection of a knowledge graph into a lower-dimensional where entities and relations are represented into continuous vector spaces. Our method incorporates these semantic vector spaces as a key ingredient to guide the domain adaptation process. We combined knowledge graph embeddings with visual embeddings from the images and trained a neural network with the combined embeddings as anchors using an extension of Fisher’s linear discriminant. We evaluated our approach on two cultural heritage datasets of images containing medieval and renaissance musical instruments. The experimental results showed a significant increase in the baselines and state-of-the-art performance compared with other domain adaptation methods. Copyright: © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Over the past few decades, the enormous expansion of medical data has led to searching for ways of data analysis in smart healthcare systems. Acquisition of data from pictures, archives, communication systems, electronic health records, online documents, radiology reports and clinical records of different styles with specific numerical information has given rise to the concept of multimodality and the need for machine learning and deep learning techniques in the analysis of the healthcare system. Medical data play a vital role in medical education and diagnosis; determining dependency between distinct modalities is essential. This paper gives a gist of current radiology medical data analysis techniques and their various approaches and frameworks for representation and classification. A brief outline of the existing medical multimodal data processing work is presented. The main objective of this study is to spot gaps in the surveyed area and list future tasks and challenges in radiology. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (or PRISMA) guidelines were incorporated in this study for effective article search and to investigate several relevant scientific publications. The systematic review was carried out on multimodal medical data analysis and highlighted advantages, limitations and strategies. The inherent benefit of multimodality in the medical domain powered with artificial intelligence has a significant impact on the performance of the disease diagnosis frameworks. © 2022 by the author(s).

AB  - Today, Web3D technologies and the rise of new standards, combined with faster browsers and better hardware integration, allow the creation of engaging and interactive web applications that target the field of cultural heritage. Functional, accessible, and expressive approaches to discovering the past starting from the present (or vice-versa) are generally a strong requirement. Cultural heritage artifacts, decorated walls, etc. can be considered as palimpsests with a stratification of different actions over time (modifications, restorations, or even reconstruction of the original artifact). The details of such an articulated cultural record can be difficult to distinguish and communicate visually, while entire archaeological sites often exhibit profound changes in terms of shape and function due to human activities over time. The web offers an incredible opportunity to present and communicate enriched 3D content using common web browsers, although it raises additional challenges. We present an interactive 4D technique called “Temporal Lensing”, which is suitable for online multi-temporal virtual environments and offers an expressive, accessible, and effective way to locally peek into the past (or into the future) by targeting interactive Web3D applications, including those leveraging recent standards, such as WebXR (immersive VR on the web). This technique extends previous approaches and presents different contributions, including (1) a volumetric, temporal, and interactive lens approach; (2) complete decoupling of the involved 3D representations from the runtime perspective; (3) a wide range applications in terms of size (from small artifacts to entire archaeological sites); (4) cross-device scalability of the interaction model (mobile devices, multi-touch screens, kiosks, and immersive VR); and (5) simplicity of use. We implemented and developed the described technique on top of an open-source framework for interactive 3D presentation of CH content on the web. We show and discuss applications and results related to three case studies, as well as integrations of the temporal lensing with different input interfaces for dynamically interacting with its parameters. We also assessed the technique within a public event where a remote web application was deployed on tablets and smartphones, without any installation required by visitors. We discuss the implications of temporal lensing, its scalability from small to large virtual contexts, and its versatility for a wide range of interactive 3D applications. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - With the development of digital technology, Memory Projects, such as the American Memory and the Venice Time Machine, have been explored continually as typical digital humanity projects. In these projects, humanists are able to look into the thousand-year-history with a macro view by a 'data telescope', as well as numerous micro views by 'data microscopes'. This article investigates representative historical memory and city memory projects from over the past 20 years and analyses the purpose, investigation, cooperation, methods, implementation, and technical routes adopted. The following problems are apparent: resource decentralization and fragmentation, duplication of database construction, single-user service mode and low utilization rate of cultural heritage resources, etc. This study provides an overall technical route to solve these problems by examining ongoing practice. The Shanghai Memory Project, undertaken by Shanghai Library, uses knowledge reorganization and data reconciling technologies such as Big Data, Semantic Web, and Knowledge Graph to construct an overarching Humanities Research Environment, which is co-constructing, sharing, and interconnecting to avoid problems of resource decentralization and database duplication. The Project provides a user service model, which combines the library creating knowledge with user-generated content. Implementing data visualization technologies, such as AR, VR, etc., the project improves the collection display and promotes the utilization of the resources. The Urban Memory Project is a comprehensive program that relies on cooperation and interdisciplinary collaboration, co-construction, and the sharing of data. Meanwhile, an increasing number of Urban Memory Projects play a significant role in helping to develop the Digital Humanities' infrastructure.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Scientific publications from a group or consortium often form a coherent larger body of work with underlying threads and relationships. Rich social, structural, and topical networks between authors and organizations can be identified, and to convey these we have created the publicly available “Science Library” as a user-centric, interactive portal. A key consideration in this endeavor is rapid and efficient curation of the corpus of publications, both in terms of assuring quality, as well minimizing the effort required. For this to be sustainable it must offer substantial benefits to the community and avoid excessive operational cost through cumbersome or complex processes. We describe the agility of the Science Library implementation as a controlled natural language (CNL) semantic knowledge graph and describe the different roles within the community to ensure efficient curation, validation, and provenance of the content. By describing the process of curation and validation, alongside the CNL-based definition of the model we show how relatively non-technical users are able to interact with, and contribute to the Science Library. This provides an extensible approach, initially based around digital library and virtual community capabilities, that can be applied more broadly to support other desired capabilities of Science Gateways. © 2020 IBM Research Europe.

AB  - Tools for HEritage Science Processing, Integration, and ANalysis (THESPIAN) is a cloud system that offers multiple web services to the researchers of INFN-CHNet, from storing their raw data to reusing them by following the FAIR principles for establishing integration and interoperability among shared information. The injection in the CHNet cloud database of data and metadata (the latter modelled on a CIDOC-based ontology called CRMhs [20]) is performed by using the cloud service THESPIAN-Mask. THESPIAN-NER is a tool based on a deep neural network for Named Entity Recognition (NER), which will ease the data extraction from the database, enabling users to upload.pdf or.txt files and obtain named entities and keywords to be fetched in the metadata entries of the database. The neural network, on which THESPIAN-NER relies, is based on a set of open-source NLP models; transfer learning was employed to customise the Named Entity Recognition output of the models to match the CRMhs ontology properties. The service is now available in alpha version to researchers on the CHNet cloud. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Nowadays, the new generation of information technology can provide excellent support for the practical training in a higher vocational architectural major. The main research methods in training rooms' development are analyzed, and then the problems encountered in the current building training are discussed in detail. In order to solve these problems, technologies such as cloud computing, knowledge graph, teaching resource library, artificial intelligence and others are proposed to design an intelligent management framework suitable for a vocational building training center. This framework can support both online virtual training and training on site. A test has proven that the implementation of this framework can effectively meet the training needs of the building training with high scalability and intelligence.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Digital photographic capture of pictorial artworks with gigapixel resolution (around 1000 megapixels or greater) is a novel technique that is beginning to be used by some important international museums as a means of documentation, analysis, and dissemination of their masterpieces. This line of research is extremely interesting, not only for art curators and scholars but also for the general public. The results can be disseminated through online virtual museum displays, offering a detailed interactive visualization. These virtual visualizations allow the viewer to delve into the artwork in such a way that it is possible to zoom in and observe those details, which would be negligible to the naked eye in a real visit. Therefore, this kind of virtual visualization using gigapixel images has become an essential tool to enhance cultural heritage and to make it accessible to every-one. Since today’s professional digital cameras provide images of around 40 megapixels, obtaining gigapixel images requires some special capture and editing techniques. This article describes a series of photographic methodologies and equipment, developed by the team of researchers, that have been put into practice to achieve a very high level of detail and chromatic fidelity, in the documentation and dissemination of pictorial artworks. The result of this research work consisted in the gigapixel documentation of several masterpieces of the Museo de Bellas Artes of Valencia, one of the main art galleries in Spain. The results will be disseminated through the Internet, as will be shown with some examples. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Multimodal fusion of different types of neural image data provides an irreplaceable opportunity to take advantages of complementary cross-modal information that may only partially be contained in single modality. To jointly analyze multimodal data, deep neural networks can be especially useful because many studies have suggested that deep learning strategy is very efficient to reveal complex and non-linear relations buried in the data. However, most deep models, e.g., convolutional neural network and its numerous extensions, can only operate on regular Euclidean data like voxels in 3D MRI. The interrelated and hidden structures that beyond the grid neighbors, such as brain connectivity, may be overlooked. Moreover, how to effectively incorporate neuroscience knowledge into multimodal data fusion with a single deep framework is understudied. In this work, we developed a graph-based deep neural network to simultaneously model brain structure and function in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI): the topology of the graph is initialized using structural network (from diffusion MRI) and iteratively updated by incorporating functional information (from functional MRI) to maximize the capability of differentiating MCI patients from elderly normal controls. This resulted in a new connectome by exploring “deep relations” between brain structure and function in MCI patients and we named it as Deep Brain Connectome. Though deep brain connectome is learned individually, it shows consistent patterns of alteration comparing to structural network at group level. With deep brain connectome, our developed deep model can achieve 92.7% classification accuracy on ADNI dataset. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents an approach how to create FAIR data for prehistoric mining archaeology, based on the CIDOC CRM ontology and semantic web standards. The interdisciplinary Research Centre HiMAT (History of mining activities in the Tyrol and adjacent areas, University of Innsbruck) investigates mining history from prehistoric to modern times with an interdisciplinary approach. One of the projects carried out at the research centre is the multinational DACH project “Prehistoric copper production in the eastern and central Alps”. For a specific geographical region of the project, the data transformation to open and re-usable data is investigated in a separate Open Research Data pilot project. The methodological approach will use the FAIR principles to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable. Every archaeological investigation in Austria has to be documented according to the requirements of the Austrian Federal Monuments Office. This documentation is deposited in the CERN-based EU supported research data repository ZENODO. For each deposited file, metadata are created through the application of the conceptual metadata schema CIDOC CRM, an ISO standard for Cultural Heritage Information, which was adopted by ARIADNE, the European Union Research Infrastructure for archaeological resources. Concepts specific to mining archaeology research are organized with the DARIAH Back Bone Thesaurus, a model for sustainable interoperable thesauri maintenance, developed in the European Union Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities. Metadata are created through the extraction of information from the documentation and the transformation to a knowledge graph using semantic web standards. To facilitate usage, graph data are exported to hierarchical and tabular formats representing sites and objects with their geographic locations, temporal and typological assignments and links to the research activities and documents. Metadata are deposited together with the documentation into the repository. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Capturing paintings with gigapixel resolution (resolution around 1000 megapixels or greater) is an innovative technique that is starting to be used by some important international museums for documenting, analysing, and disseminating their masterpieces. This line of research is extremely interesting, not only for art curators and scholars, but also for the general public. The results can be disseminated through online virtual tours, offering a detailed interactive visualization. These virtual tours allow the viewer to delve into the artwork, in such a way, that it is possible to zoom in and observe those details, which would be negligible to the naked eye in a real visit. Therefore, this kind of virtual visualization using gigapixel images becomes an essential tool to enhance this cultural heritage and to make it accessible to everyone. This article will describe an affordable methodology, based on SfM photogrammetry techniques, with which it will be possible to achieve a very high level of detail and chromatic fidelity, when documenting and disseminating pictorial artworks. As a practical example, there will be shown a case study of the altarpiece, from the Museo de Bellas Artes de Valencia (Spain), entitled <i>Virgen de las fiebres</i>, painted around 1500 by Bernardino di Benedetto di Biagio, nicknamed ĝ€ <i>Il Pinturicchio</i>' (Perugia, ca. 1454-Siena, 1513). © 2021 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.

AB  - The formal representation of cultural metadata has always been a challenge, considering the heterogeneity of cultural objects and especially when dealing with experts' interpretation over them. This paper presents an overview of the mythLOD dataset production as the Mythologiae digital collection revalorisation into linked open data format. The research aims then to explore Mythologiae data leveraging semantic web potentialities, focusing over the formal representation of experts' analysis when associating visual artworks (and their interpretations) to literary sources. The workflow of the project consisted of data model definition, data cleaning and entity linking, conversion (from tabular data to graph) and testing activity (domain experts review over competency questions and two designed on-purpose data visualizations). The result is the mythLOD platform, which present the dataset and the detailed documentation of the research. Additionally, the platform hosts the two data visualization spaces which have been implemented - the online catalogue and the storytelling experiment over Aeneid - as a user-friendly testing unit for the dataset and an additional tool for documenting the project and exploring the collection.  © 2022 Valentina Pasqual, Francesca Tomasi.

AB  - In January 2016, the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital (The Neuro) declared itself an Open Science organization. This vision extends beyond efforts by individual scientists seeking to release individual datasets, software tools, or building platforms that provide for the free dissemination of such information. It involves multiple stakeholders and an infrastructure that considers governance, ethics, computational resourcing, physical design, workflows, training, education, and intra-institutional reporting structures. The C-BIG repository was built in response as The Neuro’s institutional biospecimen and clinical data repository, and collects biospecimens as well as clinical, imaging, and genetic data from patients with neurological disease and healthy controls. It is aimed at helping scientific investigators, in both academia and industry, advance our understanding of neurological diseases and accelerate the development of treatments. As many neurological diseases are quite rare, they present several challenges to researchers due to their small patient populations. Overcoming these challenges required the aggregation of datasets from various projects and locations. The C-BIG repository achieves this goal and stands as a scalable working model for institutions to collect, track, curate, archive, and disseminate multimodal data from patients. In November 2020, a Registered Access layer was made available to the wider research community at https://cbigr-open.loris.ca, and in May 2021 fully open data will be released to complement the Registered Access data. This article outlines many of the aspects of The Neuro’s transition to Open Science by describing the data to be released, C-BIG’s full capabilities, and the design aspects that were implemented for effective data sharing. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The Protein Data Bank in Europe – Knowledge Base (PDBe-KB, https://pdbe-kb.org) is an open collaboration between world-leading specialist data resources contributing functional and biophysical annotations derived from or relevant to the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The goal of PDBe-KB is to place macromolecular structure data in their biological context by developing standardised data exchange formats and integrating functional annotations from the contributing partner resources into a knowledge graph that can provide valuable biological insights. Since we described PDBe-KB in 2019, there have been significant improvements in the variety of available annotation data sets and user functionality. Here, we provide an overview of the consortium, highlighting the addition of annotations such as predicted covalent binders, phosphorylation sites, effects of mutations on the protein structure and energetic local frustration. In addition, we describe a library of reusable web-based visualisation components and introduce new features such as a bulk download data service and a novel superposition service that generates clusters of superposed protein chains weekly for the whole PDB archive. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Nowadays, museums are developing chatbots to assist their visitors and to provide an enhanced visiting experience. Most of these chatbots do not provide a human‐like conversation and fail to deliver the complete requested knowledge by the visitors. There are plenty of stand‐alone museum chatbots, developed using a chatbot platform, that provide predefined dialog routes. However, as chatbot platforms are evolving and AI technologies mature, new architectural approaches arise. Museums are already designing chatbots that are trained using machine learning techniques or chatbots connected to knowledge graphs, delivering more intelligent chatbots. This paper is surveying a representative set of developed museum chatbots and platforms for implementing them. More importantly, this paper presents the result of a systematic evaluation approach for evaluating both chatbots and platforms. Furthermore, the paper is introducing a novel approach in developing intelligent chatbots for museums. This approach emphasizes graph‐based, distributed, and collaborative multi‐chatbot conversational AI systems for museums. The paper accentuates the use of knowledge graphs as the key technology for potentially providing unlimited knowledge to chatbot users, satisfying conversational AI’s need for rich machine‐understandable content. In addition, the proposed architecture is designed to deliver an efficient deployment solution where knowledge can be distributed (distributed knowledge graphs) and shared among different chatbots that collaborate when is needed. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This paper discusses current challenges in archaeological cultural heritage data management and presents the interdisciplinary research project DigiNUMA. The project investigates solutions in data harmonisation and dissemination of pan-European cultural heritage through an interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral project in Digital Humanities, semantic computing, participatory heritage, museum collections management and archaeological/numismatic studies. Using Finnish and English numismatic data as a test case, DigiNUMA creates ontological infrastructure and a proof-of-concept data model for finely-grained Linked Open Data (LOD) harmonisation across national and international databases for cultural heritage data, and tests it through a broad suite of Digital Humanities analyses. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Lublin is a city located in the eastern part of Poland, which is an important place of cultural heritage, being the venue where the Polish-Lithuanian Union was signed 450 years ago in 2019. This article presents "Architectural Jewels of Lublin,"a computerized serious board game for two players. The aim of the game is to collect points for recognizing models of the city's historic architectural objects and their correct position on the board. They represent the landmarks of the historic Old Town quarter. Another point of the game is to answer questions about the cultural heritage of Lublin. 3D models of historic buildings were initially designed manually and then 3D printed in FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) technology. The correct location of the object on the board is identified by sensors working in the RFID (Radio-Frequency IDentification) technology supported by two microcontrollers of an Arduino platform, which were connected to the software managing the whole game shown on a tablet monitor. The game is used both to promote Lublin at numerous cyclical cultural and science popularization events, and during conferences and seminars organized for circles representing cultural heritage from Poland and abroad. It is aimed at presenting a way to integrate many different contemporary digital technologies that can serve education in the area of cultural heritage. The game, in contrast to popular games using VR and AR technologies, combines in an interesting way physical and digital space using modern computer technologies. The research carried out on the participants of the game has shown its high effectiveness in raising the historical awareness of its participants, as well as the players' positive attitude toward the game.  © 2021 ACM.

AB  - The continuous growth of available resources on the web, both in the form of Linked Open Data and on Social Networks, provides an important opportunity to gather information concerning specific kinds of touristic activities like, for example, cultural tourism, eco-tourism, bike-tourism, and so on. Both decision makers and tourists can take advantage from these data, as demonstrated by previous works, with institutional actors foreseeing an increase in the use of this data to substitute other time-consuming and expensive approaches. However, managing multiple sources built with different goals and structures is not straightforward, so specific design choices must be made when assembling this kind of information. Graph databases represent an ideal way to combine multiple-source data but, to be successful, strategies accounting for inconsistencies and format differences have to be defined to support coherent analysis. Also, the continuously changing nature of crowd-sourced data makes it difficult, for the research community, to compare technological approaches to the different tasks that are linked to cultural heritage, from recommendation to management. To support the research effort in this direction, we describe the data ingestion and enrichment procedure we followed to organise knowledge coming from three different sources, namely Wikidata, Wikipedia, and Flickr, into a single, application-oriented, resource organised as a graph database. We present the potential use of this resource to perform multiple source analyses targeting the specific case of cultural tourism on a nationwide scale, and we propose its use as a shared benchmark for technological applications designed to support optimal management of cultural resources.  © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Rapid and accurate acquisition of refining catalysts knowledge from mass data is beneficial to saving the time cost of developing novel refining catalysts. Scientific research archives, regarded as carriers to record the process data and experiential knowledge, are the important basis for the development of refining catalyst production technology. Through analyzing the current situation about the utilization of refining catalysts-related scientific research archives, it can be found that those archives are not effectively combined with the research and production process, and thus resulting in severe waste of resources. In order to enhance the use value of archives in product development, the idea about construction of refining catalyst archives thematic database was raised. In this paper, the system architecture, overall technical framework and operation strategy were introduced, which could meet different users’ demand during the research and development process. The database also realizes its supporting role in research, which is expected to work as a reference in scientific research archives of petrochemical industry in China when it comes to data management and knowledge mining. © 2021, Chemical Industry Press Co., Ltd.

AB  - The development of the field of digital humanities in recent years has led to the increased use of knowledge graphs within the community. Many digital humanities projects tend to model their data based on CIDOC-CRM ontology, which offers a wide array of classes appropriate for storing humanities and cultural heritage data. The CIDOC-CRM ontology model leads to a knowledge graph structure in which many entities are often linked to each other through chains of relations, which means that relevant information often lies many hops away from their entities. In this paper, we present a method based on graph walks and text processing to extract entity information and provide semantically relevant embeddings. In the process, we were able to generate similarity recommenda-tions as well as explore their underlying data structure. This approach was then demonstrated on the Sphaera Dataset which was modeled according to the CIDOC-CRM data structure. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Service robots are envisioned to be adaptive to their working envi-ronment based on situational knowledge. Recent research focused on designing visual representation of knowledge graphs for ex-pert users. However, how to generate an understandable interface for non-expert users remains to be explored. In this paper, we use knowledge graphs (KGs) as a common ground for knowledge ex-change and develop a pattern library for designing KG interfaces for non-expert users. After identifying the types of robotic situa-tional knowledge from the literature, we present a formative study in which participants used cards to communicate the knowledge for given scenarios. We iteratively coded the results and identifed patterns for representing various types of situational knowledge. To derive design recommendations for applying the patterns, we prototyped a lab service robot and conducted Wizard-of-Oz testing. The patterns and recommendations could provide useful guidance in designing knowledge-exchange interfaces for robots. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - In language technology and language sciences, tab-separated values (TSV) represent a frequently used formalism to represent linguistically annotated natural language, often addressed as “CoNLL formats”. A large number of such formats do exist, but although they share a number of common features, they are not interoperable, as different pieces of information are encoded differently in these dialects. CoNLL-RDF refers to a programming library and the associated data model that has been introduced to facilitate processing and transforming such TSV formats in a serialization-independent way. CoNLL-RDF represents CoNLL data, by means of RDF graphs and SPARQL update operations, but so far, without machine-readable semantics, with annotation properties created dynamically on the basis of a user-defined mapping from columns to labels. Current applications of CoNLL-RDF include linking between corpora and dictionaries [28] and knowledge graphs [36], syntactic parsing of historical languages [12, 11], the consolidation of syntactic and semantic annotations [8], a bridge between RDF corpora and a traditional corpus query language [24], and language contact studies [6]. We describe a novel extension of CoNLL-RDF, introducing a formal data model, formalized as an ontology. The ontology is a basis for linking RDF corpora with other Semantic Web resources, but more importantly, its application for transformation between different TSV formats is a major step for providing interoperability between CoNLL formats. © Christian Chiarcos, Maxim Ionov, Luis Glaser, and Christian Fäth; licensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY 4.0

AB  - The increasing digitization and the emergence of new data-sharing practices change our understanding of how cultural heritage is defined, collected, and exhibited. We must pay particular attention to the ways in which digital interfaces curate history. Crowdsourcing, social media, linked open data, and other open science practices challenge the current practices of cultural heritage institutions, owing to the established structures between and within them and the character of the networked publics involved. However, such challenges also open new opportunities for wider negotiations of cultural heritage and rethinking what cultural heritage institutions and practices are. This special issue brings together scholars from different disciplines to provide critically and empirically grounded perspectives on the datafication of cultural heritage institutions’ exhibition and collection practices. © 2022 by the University of Texas Press

AB  - Data exploration and inspection within semantically enriched multi-dimensional contexts, may benefit of immersive VR presentation when proper 3D user interfaces are adopted. WebXR represents a great opportunity to investigate, experiment, develop and assess advanced multi-dimensional interactive tools for Cultural Heritage, making them accessible through a common web browser. We present and describe the potential of WebXR and a set of building blocks for crafting such immersive data inspection tools, exploiting recent web standards and spatial user interfaces. We describe the current state of the EMviq tool - developed within SSHOC European project - and how it is taking advantage of these components for online immersive sessions. The EMviq tool allows to visually inspect and query an Extended Matrix dataset, allowing to query and explore all the information within the knowledge graph relating to the interpretative datasets - in this paper applied to the case studies of the Roman theatre of Catania and Montebelluna smithy. The main functionalities discussed are spatio-temporal exploration, search and selection of stratigraphic units, and the presentation of metadata and paradata related to the data provenance (both objective and interpretative). © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This paper presents an improvement of collaborative activities in a knowledge-graph construction framework, so-called Community-Driven Ontology-based Application Management (CD-OAM). It facilitates domain experts to make a consensus with the corresponding concept of the Buddha Image (BDI) ontology. Real-world concepts of Buddha Image are described as entities and relationships in a knowledge graph. mapping the sources of knowledge (reference documents, discussion context, and existing ontology). In our scenario, domain experts of different perspectives pointed out epistemological discrepancies of the same concept definition, while identifying the origin of the big Buddha s head in Bangkok National Museum. Their consensus provided us to understand the reasons for different concept properties by referencing evidence. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays, many technologies are changing our way of life, including those related to extended reality. One of the most interesting is Augmented Reality (AR). Today, even if this technology seems to be discovered yet, it is widely applied in several contexts, including the fruition and conservation of cultural heritage. Such spread is mainly offered by the new and more powerful mobile devices, allowing museums and art exhibitions to use AR to offer new experiences to visitors. In this paper, we present an augmented reality mobile system based on content-based image analysis techniques and Linked Open Data to improve the user knowledge about cultural heritage. We use different image analysis techniques, and we present several experimental results to show the performance of our system. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This paper shows how the newly published Linked Open Data (LOD) service and semantic portal “AcademySampo - Finnish Academic People 1640-1899” can be used for Digital Humanities (DH) research. The original primary data, based on some ten man-years of digitization work, covers a significant part of the Finnish university history based on the student registries in 1640-1852 and 1853-1899. They contain biographical descriptions of 28 000 students of the University of Helsinki, originally the Royal Academy of Turku. AcademySampo also sheds light to the academic history of Sweden and Baltic countries through their shared history with Finland in the larger Swedish Empire. The Finnish student registries have been widely used by genealogists and historians by close reading. We argue that unprecedented new possibilities for DH research are now enabled by using AcademySampo: the underlying knowledge graph can be accessed and analyzed using Semantic Web technologies and tools and with the ready-to-use data-analytic tools of the portal. Examples of data-analysis are presented by using the AcademySampo system for studying migrations of students in Finland, Sweden, Russia, and Estonia, history of student nations, inheritance of vocations and social classes, lengths of family lines of students, and network analyses of students. Related analyses have been made before using biographical dictionaries but not for academic history and student registries. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Starting from the case of the choirstalls in the Oviedo Cathedral, that were dismantled and partially rebuilt in the chapterhouse of the same building, this article describes the process of virtual reconstruction and subsequent interactive visualization of the original set in its context. To do that, equirectangular images of the current building are geometrically integrated with the virtual model of the stalls completely rebuilt from the photogrammetric survey of part of it, still preserved. The technique allows to combine real and virtual images in a hyper-realistic, interactive, and immersive way. It offers the viewer a “mixed” virtual tour of the cathedral central nave that incorporates the reconstructed virtual model in its originally designed location. The proposed methodology supposes a new visualization strategy that, in an economic, interactive, ubiquitous, and universal way, must allow progress in the dissemination of decontextualized heritage. © 2022 Universitat Politecnica de Valencia.

AB  - The fruition of the cultural heritage in the pandemic era has been stressed even more towards online and virtual environments. Usually the web site publishing process involves many competences, or the ability of the single cultural operator, which needs to become expert in many complex techniques. In the paper we present the VIEd’ARTE Project, an experience of implementation of a web publication framework supporting the work of cultural operators with tools for the data access to repositories and for the page design of the web applications. An example is shown using the VIEd’ARTE framework for the design of the virtual tour “On the trail of the Renaissance”. The publication framework of VIEd’ARTE manages different types of cultural objects and many types of presentations. The front-end side features include templates and predefined layouts, supporting a presentation model for a large public. The back-end side offers access capabilities to SQL databases, in particular to BeWEB archives, which contain data of different types of cultural heritage assets. The metadata layer of the BeWeb Portal allows the integration of the various data fonts. The data access model will move in the next future to allow also no-SQL databases and OAI (Open Archives Initiative) or Linked Open Data protocols to access databases. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Despite rapid growth in young children visiting museums, and an increasing acknowledgement that these visits are important to children’s development as cultural citizens [Mudiappa and Kluczniok 2015. “Visits to Cultural Learning Places in the Early Childhood.” European Early Childhood Education Research Journal 23 (2): 200–212] there is still relatively little published research on children’s encounters with them [Hackett, Holmes, and Macrae 2020. Working with Young Children in Museums: Weaving Theory and Practice. London: Routledge]. Our practitioner-led ‘playgroup-in-residence’ explored how young children made sense of the museum in dialogue with the objects, spaces, and people within it. Working within an interpretivist framework, we collectedrich multimodal data and used grounded theory to identify significant patterns in children’s responses. One important theme was the way in which children made marks and left traces to both explore and communicate their emerging sense of belonging within the museum. Our findings have implications for understanding how young children enter into dialogue with environments outside the home. This work is important as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, during which children have spent long periods at home. It is vital that we support them to forge relationships with places and spaces within the wider community. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Abstract: Recently, various computational methods have been proposed to find new therapeutic applications of the existing drugs. The Multimodal Restricted Boltzmann Machine approach (MM-RBM), which has the capability to connect the information about the multiple modalities, can be applied to the problem of drug repurposing. The present study utilized MM-RBM to combine two types of data, including the chemical structures data of small molecules and differentially expressed genes as well as small molecules perturbations. In the proposed method, two separate RBMs were applied to find out the features and the specific probability distribution of each datum (modality). Besides, RBM was used to integrate the discovered features, resulting in the identification of the probability distribution of the combined data. The results demonstrated the significance of the clusters acquired by our model. These clusters were used to discover the medicines which were remarkably similar to the proposed medications to treat COVID-19. Moreover, the chemical structures of some small molecules as well as dysregulated genes’ effect led us to suggest using these molecules to treat COVID-19. The results also showed that the proposed method might prove useful in detecting the highly promising remedies for COVID-19 with minimum side effects.

AB  - The paper presents the adoption of semantic metadata design and domain entity linking to enrich an opera photographic digital collection, proving how to leverage the Semantic Web to get authoritative information to enrich metadata. The ongoing digitisation program of the photographic archive of the Teatro Comunale di Bologna produced so far more than 8 thousand images over a century of opera seasons. During the design of the browsing application, the initial requirement was to access photos by simple and domain related criteria. Given that the cataloguing process produced some very basic metadata, an LD-aided procedure was developed to enrich metadata through the alignment with two external Knowledge Bases (KBs): WikiData and Corago LOD, the KB about the Italian opera. The result is a web application based on the Omeka S platform that enables users to browse the collection by works, events or portrayed artists. The experimentation confirms both the feasibility and benefits resulting from the adoption of Linked Data to organise and enhance archival information in a performing arts case study. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The global world cultural heritage ont and its environmental data are the basis for the recognition and protection of heritage values, as well as for the research, demonstration and sustainable use of heritage in the age of big data.Based on the network and earth big data, this paper constructs the knowledge map of the world cultural heritage by using the techniques of natural language processing, spatial analysis and domain knowledge map, and analyzes the landscape features, cultural continuity and spatial relationship between site and city and community based on knowledge map.A global world cultural heritage data set including 869 heritage sites and more than 200 types of attributes is reconstructed, and records the rich ontology of world cultural heritage and information about the characteristics of the environment. Then the data were organized in the form of a knowledge map. The research shows that the world cultural heritage site has the characteristics of distribution along the mountains and water systems, so it can refer to the geographical units, form the cultural heritage management and protection system with regional characteristics, and promote the sustainable development of the heritage site as a whole; Changes of the spatial distance between sites and cities or communities can be divided into three phases: the constant proximity period of 1990-2000, the slowdown in 2000-2015 and the acceleration of 2015-2018.The global world cultural heritage data were organized in the form of a knowledge map, which can support multiple attributes associated graph data mining and provide a basis for data reuse and deep processing. Based on the newly constructed data set, we also analyzed and verified the data set and knowledge map from the perspectives of the era and historical process of the heritage, the typical occurrence environment around the heritage, such as the distribution of mountains and water systems, and the changes of cities and communities, so as to meet the needs of global big data monitoring in the protection of world cultural heritage. And changes of the spatial relation between sites and cities show that continued attention needs to be paid to the impact of changes in urban and heritage site spatial relations on the sustainable development of heritage in the future. © 2021, Science Press.

AB  - Knowledge graph as a research topic is increasingly popular to represent structural relations between entities. Recent years have witnessed the release of various open-source and enterprise-supported knowledge graphs with dramatic growth in applying knowledge representation and reasoning into different areas like natural language processing and computer vision. This study aims to comprehensively explore the status and trends – particularly the thematic research structure – of knowledge graphs. Specifically, based on 386 research articles published from 1991 to 2020, we conducted analyses in terms of the (1) visualization of the trends of annual article and citation counts, (2) recognition of major institutions, countries/regions, and publication sources, (3) visualization of scientific collaborations of major institutions and countries/regions, and (4) detection of major research themes and their developmental tendencies. Interest in knowledge graph research has clearly increased from 1991 to 2020 and is continually expanding. China is the most prolific country in knowledge graph research. Moreover, countries/regions and institutions that have higher levels of international collaboration are more impactful. Several widely studied issues such as knowledge graph embedding, search and query based on knowledge graphs, and knowledge graphs for intangible cultural heritage are highlighted. Based on the results, we further summarize perspective directions and suggestions for researchers, practitioners, and project managers to facilitate future research on knowledge graphs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The new national IdroGEO web platform allows the navigation, social sharing and download of data, maps, reports of the Italian Landslide Inventory, national hazard maps, and risk indicators. It is a tool for communication and dissemination of information to support decisions in risk mitigation policies, land use planning, preliminary design of infrastructures, prioritization of mitigation measures, management of civil protection emergencies, and environmental impact assessment. The challenges that have been faced during the design and development of the platform concern usability, access on multiple devices (smartphones, tablets, desktops), interoperability, transparency, reuse of information and software in the public sector, and improvement of the updating of the Italian Landslide Inventory. The methodologies and solutions adopted to address them include Progressive Web Application (PWA), Application Programming Interface (API), open standards, open libraries, and software. A landslide inventory management system has been developed via REST API for data entry and approval workflow in order to maintain the inventory in a distributed and collaborative manner. As a result, IdroGEO provides a public service for citizens, public administration, and professionals, using the “mobile first” approach and with scalable and reliable architecture. IdroGEO represents a solid infrastructure for the interoperability of data that serves as the foundation for creating a first knowledge-graph on landslides and the community who manages them. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The purpose of controlled vocabularies is to organize information and to provide terminology to catalogue and retrieve information in information systems. Vocabularies provide definitions and scope notes, which is especially important in the field of cultural heritage, capturing the richness of meanings and relationships between terms. Therefore, they are important tools for data integrity control and providing reliable search and retrieval, and also essential educational resources. Currently, there are only two controlled vocabularies in the Croatian language related to the field of cultural heritage, primarily museum collections and the protection of cultural monuments: 1) the Classification of museum and gallery objects, 2) the Thesaurus of monument types. They overlap to some extent, but also differ according to the levels of specificity, exhaustivity and structure. As an initial method of vocabulary reconciliation, mapping based on Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) mapping properties is used. This paper aims to examine the possibilities and challenges of vocabulary reconciliation and to provide guidelines for the future use of these valuable terminological resources, to improve the users' access to cultural heritage. Additional mapping of both terminologies to the Art & Architecture Thesaurus will ensure interoperability in the global linked open data environment and provide a multilingual context. © 2022 Croatian Society MIPRO.

AB  - The RESTORE project (smaRt accESs TO digital heRitage and mEmory) started in June 2020 with a duration of 2 years. The project consortium, coordinated by the Istituto Opera del Vocabolario Italiano of the Italian CNR (National Research Council of Italy), includes national Cultural Heritage institutes, such as the State Archives and the Museum of Palazzo Pretorio in Prato and the Archival and Bibliographic Superintendency of Tuscany, and the SPACE SpA software company. The project - co-financed by the Regione Toscana - has its main purpose in the recovery, integration and accessibility of data and digital objects collected by partner, in order to build a knowledge base made of information regarding the history of the city and of its civic institutions, the development of its economic and entrepreneurial system, the role of women in the development of a welfare state and network. Starting a local history approach, it is nonetheless possible to broaden the focus from the local dimension to reconstruct a significant part of the history of European and Mediterranean cities of the 14th century, including commercial and economical aspects. This paper presents a focused overview on the mapping and modeling of archival and museum digital resources encoded with different standards, such as XML-EAD, XML-EAC, XML-TEI and ICCD-OA, and covered in the CIDOC-Conceptual Reference Model, the ontology that was chosen as "common language"for semantic data integration. The long term sustainability for the project's results will be fostered by the collaboration with key players in the EU RIs environment, such as DARIAHERIC (ESFRI Landmark for the Humanities and Social Sciences) and E-RIHS (ESFRI project for the Heritage Science), as well as other actors within the EOSC Framework.  © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - This article partially addresses a challenge from Licklider in his 1965 book on “Libraries of the Future,” focusing on how to build extensible digital libraries that can dramatically expand the support of exploration. A new methodology connects the efforts of User eXperience researchers with those of subject matter experts (domain scientists, curators, researchers, and so on) and developers. This allows constructing a knowledge graph representing the relationships among goals, tasks, workflows, and services. A reasoner empowers authorized users to have their goals met with suitable workflows that are dynamically generated and executed. Student teams have applied the new methodology to support users interested in tweets, web pages, or electronic theses and dissertations, as well as those curating and experimenting with those collections. Exploration is thus broadened across content types and their elements, with an extensible set of services, to address an arbitrary set of stakeholder goals. © 2021 Edward A.

AB  - Personal health libraries (PHL) are increasingly becoming the mainstay as a single point for patient centered health information management and services. However, the transition to a solely PHL based health information management (HIM) will, at the very least, take a very long time. It is more likely therefore to co-evolve with our current systems for HIMs. In this emerging scenario, the traditional obstacles of data integration among autonomous HIMs face novel challenges. Additionally, the goal to make PHLs responsive to open-ended and personalized health information needs adds unknown wrinkles to current challenges. In this paper, we propose a new architecture, and a knowledge-based information retrieval and processing model for PHLs. We show that by using a declarative data integration language, a knowledge representation scheme and knowledge graph induction technique from health information texts, we are able to respond to patient queries in unprecedented ways in the context of their PHLs. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Learning from graph and relational data plays a major role in many applications including social network analysis, marketing, e-commerce, information retrieval, knowledge modeling, medical and biological sciences, engineering, and others. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising new learning framework capable of bringing the power of deep representation learning to graph and relational data. This ever-growing body of research has shown that GNNs achieve state-of-the-art performance for problems such as link prediction, fraud detection, target-ligand binding activity prediction, knowledge-graph completion, and product recommendations. In practice, many of the real-world graphs are very large. It is urgent to have scalable solutions to train GNN on large graphs efficiently. The objective of this tutorial is twofold. First, it will provide an overview of the theory behind GNNs, discuss the types of problems that GNNs are well suited for, and introduce some of the most widely used GNN model architectures and problems/applications that are designed to solve. Second, it will introduce the Deep Graph Library (DGL), a scalable GNN framework that simplifies the development of efficient GNN-based training and inference programs at a large scale. To make things concrete, the tutorial will cover state-of-the-art training methods to scale GNN to large graphs and provide hands-on sessions to show how to use DGL to perform scalable training in different settings (multi-GPU training and distributed training). This hands-on part will start with basic graph applications (e.g., node classification and link prediction) to set up the context and move on to train GNNs on large graphs. It will provide tutorials to demonstrate how to apply the techniques in DGL to train GNNs for real-world applications. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - The signature of the 2019 Declaration of Cooperation on advancing the digitization of cultural heritage in Europe shows the important role that the 3D digitization process plays in the safeguard and sustainability of cultural heritage. The digitization also aims at sharing and presenting cultural heritage. However, the processing steps of data acquisition to its presentation requires an interdisciplinary collaboration, where understanding and collaborative work is difficult due to the presence of different expert knowledge involved. This study proposes an end-to-end method from the cultural data acquisition to its presentation thanks to explicit semantics representing the different fields of expert knowledge intervening in this process. This method is composed of three knowledge-based processing steps: (i) a recommendation process of acquisition technology to support cultural data acquisition; (ii) an object recognition process to structure the unstructured acquired data; and (iii) an enrichment process based on Linked Open Data to document cultural objects with further information, such as geospatial, cultural, and historical information. The proposed method was applied in two case studies concerning the watermills of Ephesos terrace house 2 and the first Sacro Monte chapel in Varallo. These application cases show the proposed method’s ability to recognize and document digitized cultural objects in different contexts thanks to the semantics. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The rise of digitization of cultural documents offers large-scale contents, opening the road for development of AI systems in order to preserve, search, and deliver cultural heritage. To organize such cultural content also means to classify them, a task that is very familiar to modern computer science. Contextual information is often the key to structure such real world data, and we propose to use it in form of a knowledge graph. Such a knowledge graph, combined with content analysis, enhances the notion of proximity between artworks so it improves the performances in classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel use of a knowledge graph, that is constructed on annotated data and pseudo-labeled data. With label propagation, we boost artwork classification by training a model using a graph convolutional network, relying on the relationships between entities of the knowledge graph. Following a transductive learning framework, our experiments show that relying on a knowledge graph modeling the relations between labeled data and unlabeled data allows to achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple classification tasks on a dataset of paintings, and on a dataset of Buddha statues. Additionally, we show state-of-the-art results for the difficult case of dealing with unbalanced data, with the limitation of disregarding classes with extremely low degrees in the knowledge graph. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - This paper presents the vision of aggregating, harmonizing, and publishing letter catalog metadata (information e.g. of senders, receivers and datings of letters) from cultural heritage (CH) institutions in Finland as a single reconciled Linked Open Data (LOD) service and a semantic portal providing data analytical tools for researchers. The research is conducted as part of the consortium research project Constellations of Correspondence (CoCo). The target of the project is to study - for the first time - scattered, heterogeneous epistolary metadata regarding the period of the Grand Duchy of Finland (1809-1917) as one, integrated dataset and make it interoperable and available. This will enable scholars to ask ambitious research questions in the field of computer science and to conduct empirical, bottom-up case studies e.g. on epistolary culture, communicative networks, and heritagization processes. This paper discusses one of the first datasets acquired by the project, the letter collection of the Board of the Finnish Art Society (1846-1901), provided by the Finnish National Gallery, which contains details of c. 1150 letters sent or received by c. 400 actors. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Architectural archives, usually held by private bodies, are important primary sources of information for architecture and urban development historians; for architects themselves, who research archives for inspiration and to prepare for restoration; and also for common citizens, who may find it interesting to discover the designs of their own homes. Cataloguing standards for archival descriptions of architectural records have existed at least since the 1980s, however, the rise of Linked Open Data as a framework for publishing cultural heritage data has allowed archivists to enhance the descriptions with rich contextual information and links to external knowledge bases. In this paper, we present an extension of RiC-Ontology designed for describing architectural archival records and the creative process that leads to their production, and we discuss its application to the project files of Italian architect and engineer Dino Tamburini (1924-2011). The ontology is suitable for representing typical architectural records such as drawings, written reports, bid documents and photographs, but also the different stages of an architectural project and their actors. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Objective: PubMed has suffered from the author ambiguity problem for many years. Existing studies on author name disambiguation (AND) for PubMed only used internal metadata for development. However, some of them are incomplete (eg, a large number of names are only abbreviated and their full names are not available) or less discriminative. To this end, we present a new disambiguation method, namely AggAND, by aggregating information from external databases. Materials and Methods: We address this issue by exploring Microsoft Academic Graph, Semantic Scholar, and PubMed Knowledge Graph to enhance the built-in name metadata, and extend the internal metadata with some external and more discriminative metadata. Results: Experimental results on enhanced name metadata demonstrate comparable performance to 3 author identifier systems, as well as show superiority over the original name metadata. More importantly, our method, AggAND, incorporating both enhanced name and extended metadata, yields F1 scores of 95.80% and 93.71% on 2 datasets and outperforms the state-of-the-art method by a large margin (3.61% and 6.55%, respectively). Conclusions: The feasibility and good performance of our methods not only help better understand the importance of external databases for disambiguation, but also point to a promising direction for future AND studies in which information aggregated from multiple bibliographic databases can be effective in improving disambiguation performance. The methodology shown here can be generalized to broader bibliographic databases beyond PubMed.

AB  - As a witness of human civilization, the cultural heritage in the ancient city makes the memory of civilization more vivid and the urban living environment can be continued. Narrative map combines the advantages of cartography for expressing spatial information and narratology for expressing time information. It is an emerging direction of cartography in recent years, and it also provides a suitable space narrative carrier for ancient city.Aiming at the expression demand of ancient city narrative map, this paper studies the constituent elements, structure and relationship of ancient city narrative map from the perspective of geographical time and space, and constructs the knowledge graph of ancient city narrative map. On this basis, taking the ancient city of Qingjiangpu as an example, the paper designed the architecture of the ancient city narrative map. The paper constructed the typical landscape and architecture model of the ancient city using oblique photogrammetry and three-dimensional real scene modeling technology based on the remote sensing images, photos, historical records and other multi-source data of Qingjiangpu. At last we realized the multi-scale and multi-carrier ancient city narrative map.The design idea of narrative map based on spatiotemporal knowledge graph, and the landscape model constructing technique based on remote sensing images and other multi-source data, and the multi-scale, multi-carrier reproducing method of ancient city cultural heritage landscape proposed by this research provide references for the study of ancient city historical and cultural heritage. © 2021, Science Press.

AB  - There is a deluge of Cultural Heritage Linked Open Data containing detailed information (e.g., location, architectural styles, etc.). Teachers could use this Open Data to generate meaningful learning tasks. However, most teachers are not using this information. This may be because they are not aware of these information sources or because they have technological difficulties in accessing the information (as they need to know Semantic Web related technologies). To overcome that limitation, this demonstration paper presents Cultural Heritage Educational Semantic Tool (CHEST), a distributed application aimed at supporting teachers in authoring Cultural Heritage learning tasks based on existing Cultural Heritage Linked Open Data. Teacher annotations are published as Linked Open Data, thus facilitating the reuse of such data by other teachers (using CHEST or other applications). This new application also supports students in the completion of the learning tasks created and/or reused by their teachers. CHEST can be used by both teachers and students using a web-based desktop interface or Android/iOS mobile apps. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The NFDI (German National Research Data Infrastructure) consortia are associations of various institutions within a specific research field, which work together to develop common data infrastructures, guidelines, best practices and tools that conform to the principles of FAIR data [1, 2]. Within the NFDI, a common question is: What is the potential of Wikidata to be used as an application for science and research [3]? In this paper, we address this question by tracing current research use-cases and applications for Wikidata, its relation to standalone Wikibase instances [4], and how the two can function as complementary services to meet a range of research needs. This paper builds on lessons learned through the development of open data projects and software services within the Open Science Lab at TIB, Hannover, in the context of NFDI4Culture - the consortium including participants across the broad spectrum of the digital libraries, archives, and museums field, and the digital humanities [5, 6]. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - [Objective] This study proposes a new term extraction model for the intangible heritage (traditional drama), which also helps us construct a term database. [Methods] First, we analyzed the drama language characteristics from term category, semantic structure, and text length perspectives. Then, we added part of speech and domain features to the character representation obtained by the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model. Finally, we incorporated the graph convolutional network (GCN) to the new model and captured the constraint relationship of the distant words. [Results] The F1 value of the proposed model reached 91.11%, which was 1.3 percentage points higher than the baseline BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model. [Limitations] We only retrieved the experimental data from Baidu Baike and the official website of Intangible Cultural Heritage, which should have included more free texts from other sources, more categories of drama terms, as well as the external features. [Conclusions] The proposed model and the database for traditional drama terms will help us construct the knowledge graph for traditional drama. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The production of European silk textile is an endangered intangible cultural heritage. Digital tools can nowadays be developed to help preserving it, or even to make it more accessible for the public and the fashion industry. In this paper, we propose an image-based retrieval tool that leverages on a knowledge graph describing the silk textile production as well as rules formulated by experts of this domain. Out of several possible similarity scenarios, two have proven to work best and have been integrated into an exploratory search engine. © 2021 ACM.

We use graph Transformer to capture semantic relations, and incorporate into multi-dimensional external information such as question types and external question libraries to present knowledge graph. Thus, a series of questions can be generated based on an n-hop subgraph. In the application of educational scenarios, our approach GTQG serves for questioning teaching help improve students' reasoning and logic skills in text reading practice.  © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Docker is the de-facto container technology for software system deployment and delivery. A Dockerfile specifies how to containerize a system into a Docker image. However, creating a Dockerfile is not trivial since resolving the dependencies (e.g., third-party libraries) of diverse software requires comprehensive domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose DockerGen to containerize software packages automatically. DockerGen constructs a knowledge graph containing rich knowledge of building Docker images by analyzing nearly 220 thousand Dockerfiles. DockerGen exploits the knowledge graph to containerize the target software by creating a Dockerfile specifying the base image, dependencies, and the operation workflow. We evaluate DockerGen on 100 software packages of various categories. DockerGen achieves a 73% build success rate and a 59% configuration success rate. The experimental result indicates it is viable to automate software containerization based on a domain knowledge graph. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Traditionally, digital health data management has been based on electronic health record (EHR) systems and has been handled primarily by centralized health providers. New mechanisms are needed to give patients more control over their digital health data. Personal health libraries (PHLs) provide a single point of secure access to patients' digital health data and enable the integration of knowledge stored in their digital health profiles with other sources of global knowledge. PHLs can help empower caregivers and health care providers to make informed decisions about patients’ health by understanding medical events in the context of their lives. Objective: This paper reports the implementation of a mobile health digital intervention that incorporates both digital health data stored in patients’ PHLs and other sources of contextual knowledge to deliver tailored recommendations for improving self-care behaviors in diabetic adults. Methods: We conducted a thematic assessment of patient functional and nonfunctional requirements that are missing from current EHRs based on evidence from the literature. We used the results to identify the technologies needed to address those requirements. We describe the technological infrastructures used to construct, manage, and integrate the types of knowledge stored in the PHL. We leverage the Social Linked Data (Solid) platform to design a fully decentralized and privacy-aware platform that supports interoperability and care integration. We provided an initial prototype design of a PHL and drafted a use case scenario that involves four actors to demonstrate how the proposed prototype can be used to address user requirements, including the construction and management of the PHL and its utilization for developing a mobile app that queries the knowledge stored and integrated into the PHL in a private and fully decentralized manner to provide better recommendations. Results: To showcase the main features of the mobile health app and the PHL, we mapped those features onto a framework comprising the user requirements identified in a use case scenario that features a preventive intervention from the diabetes self-management domain. Ongoing development of the app requires a formative evaluation study and a clinical trial to assess the impact of the digital intervention on patient-users. We provide synopses of both study protocols. Conclusions: The proposed PHL helps patients and their caregivers take a central role in making decisions regarding their health and equips their health care providers with informatics tools that support the collection and interpretation of the collected knowledge. By exposing the PHL functionality as an open service, we foster the development of third-party applications or services and provide motivational technological support in several projects crossing different domains of interest. © Nariman Ammar, James E Bailey, Robert L Davis, Arash Shaban-Nejad.

AB  - This work provides a proficient approach to coordinate archeological exercises, information administration, digital object representation, and spatial investigation. The proposed framework furnishes the client with the intuitive investigation of the 3D model artifacts along with detailed information on specific points of interest alongside their 3D geographic information system (3D GIS). A parallel result is the utilization of fully transparent and costeffective open-source tools and free software. The work addressed the creation of a computerized system that aids classification, administration, and representation of archeological discoveries inside a 3D web-based repository; and the utilization of 3D digital models as a restoration of the artifacts to allow navigation through the data; besides enabling 3D GIS to spatially store, share, envision and examine complex archeological components; This work is one of the first of its type in Qatar to archive and record all of the archeological data from the Murwab site in Qatar. © 2022.

AB  - The main mission of cultural memory institutions is to protect their collections and to provide access to a wider audience. World Wide Web technology offers different tools to fulfill this mission. Among a range of applications, the most effective is the search engines’ search for metadata of collections. However, search engines are not always able to see all sources caused by various problems. Linked data is a publishing technique that uses standard web technologies to associate data with other data and makes them available on the Web. In available literature, it is seen that many memory institutions use Linked Open Data as a solution to the search engine problem with the main motivation of making their collections more accessible. However, these applications are still not at proficient level. In this study, Linked Open Data studies in the available literature were scanned and a process map was created based on these applications. These applications, which especially require technical knowledge and infrastructure, can be confusing for memory institutions that have not yet participated in the process. In this context, it is clear that the process map created as a result of this study will be enlightening for memory institutions. The most important point on the map is that an extensive decision-making mechanism should be formed with the stakeholders before starting the process and the implementation plan should be developed in detail over the problems of existing projects. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Art history research examines objects as embedded in a web of relationships, including multiple spatial dimensions (e.g. of the materials, of the artist, of the cultural influences, of the museum collection, and of the temporary exhibitions). However, this richness of nuances is not yet fully encompassed in Linked Open Data standards. This paper aims to examine how the multiplicity of places entangled in art objects can be represented within existing vocabularies (Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names, Geonames, Pleiades, Trismegistos), ontologies (CIDOC CRM, Europeana Data Model, Linked Ancient World Data, Wikidata, LIDO) and interconnection formats (Pelagios, World Historical Gazetteer, SENESCHAL, Linked Art). In doing so, this article raises a series of questions concerning the potential and limitation of current solutions for representing geographical information. It highlights the needs for inclusive, interoperable, open and accessible features in LOD systems in spatial humanities and it traces possible areas of inquiry for further research. The article argues that there is the need to develop more granular and comprehensive solutions for encompassing the multiplicity of places that can be enclosed in an art object, and its itineraries across time and space. © Edinburgh University Press 2022.

AB  - As with almost all data, museum collection catalogues are largely unstructured, variable in consistency and overwhelmingly composed of thin records. The form of these catalogues means that the potential for new forms of research, access and scholarly enquiry that range across multiple collections and related datasets remains dormant. In the project Heritage Connector: Transforming text into data to extract meaning and make connections, we are applying a battery of digital techniques to connect similar, identical and related objects within and across collections and other publications. In this article, we describe a framework to create a Linked Open Data knowledge graph from digital museum catalogues, perform record linkage to Wikidata, and add new entities to this graph from textual catalogue record descriptions (information retrieval). We focus on the use of machine learning to create these links at scale with a small amount of labelled data, and models which are small enough to run inference on datasets the size of museum collections on a mid-range laptop or a small cloud virtual machine. Our method for record linkage against Wikidata achieves 85%+ precision with the Science Museum Group (SMG) collection, and our method for information retrieval is shown to improve NER performance compared with pretrained models on the SMG collection with no labelled training data. We publish open-source software providing tools to perform these tasks. © 2021 The Authors. Applied AI Letters published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - In order to unify access to multiple heterogeneous sources of cultural heritage data, many datasets were mapped to the CIDOC-CRM ontology. CIDOC-CRM provides a formal structure and definitions for most cultural heritage concepts and their relationships. The COURAGE project includes historic data concerning people, organizations, cultural heritage collections, and collection items covering the period between 1950 and 1990. Therefore, CIDOC-CRM seemed the optimal choice for describing COURAGE entities, improving knowledge sharing, and facilitating the COURAGE dataset unification with other datasets. This paper introduces the results of translating the COURAGE dataset to CIDOC-CRM semantically. This mapping was implemented automatically according to predefined mapping rules. Several SPARQL queries were applied to validate the migration process manually. In addition, multiple SHACL shapes were conducted to validate the data and mapping models. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Software reuse most focuses on component based software development (CBSD). However, it's not so accurate and efficient in the process, to solve this problem, this paper proposes an intelligent knowledge-driven method of target component retrieval and evaluation. This method is based on Ontology component description. With the help of the knowledge graph, a semantic mapping is formed between the component to be queried and the component description library, so the entity component is located. In order to measure the component matching performance, it gives multi-angle evaluation of queried candidate components by an evaluation index system. Based on component query information, it makes the searching target clearer, extends the semantic scope of components to be queried. In order to assembly components, a multi agent system (MAS) is also established. The result shows that this method not only makes the component retrieval process higher recall and precision, but also makes the component retrieval process more intelligent by meeting the assembly requirement.  © 2021 ACM.

AB  - In this work, doctors can find useful tips to discover semantic similarities to diagnostic tasks, natural biomedical language, and writing to obtain effective simulations. It proposes a concrete analytical framework for a considerable collection. It does some preliminary analysis using datasets extracted from the entire graduate entrance exam library. It has developed a web front end to demonstrate this method's practicality in the real-world context. The quickly extending field of enormous information examination is starting to assume a basic function in creating clinical practice and exploration. It gives a device to amass and retain a lot of organized and unstructured information created by the board, investigation, and current medical services frameworks. As of late, big data information examination has been applied to measures that help clinical administrations and illness investigation. The appropriation and R and D in this space are hampered by some key issues intrinsic in the huge information worldview. Basic Analysis of Images, Signals, and Genomics: In this article focus on these key challenges and discusses some of the three promising medical research areas. It targets large amounts of medical data, and the use of multimodal data from different sources has also been discussed in recent studies. Research Areas with the potential and significant impact in providing medical services are also being considered. © 2020

AB  - This article presents a new knowledge-based approach for finding interesting semantic relations between resources in a knowledge graph (KG). The idea is to characterize the notion of 'interesting connection' in terms of generic ontological explanation patterns that are applied to an underlying linked data repository to instantiate connections. In this way, (1) semantically uninteresting connections can be ruled out effectively and (2) natural language explanations about the connections can be created for the end-user. The idea has been implemented and tested based on a KG of biographical data extracted from the life stories of 13,144 prominent historical persons in Finland, enriched by data linking to collection databases of museums, libraries, and archives. The demonstrator is in use as part of the BiographySampo portal of interlinked biographies.  © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: Based on the topics of abstracts, times cited, and co-citation networks, this paper explores the knowledge system of dance teaching in China so as to provide a reference for future research based on bibliometrics. Method: According to the CSSCI database, a statistical analysis of Chinese research in dance teaching from 1998 to 2020 is carried out to discover implicit topics. In view of research hotspots and frontiers, this paper conducts a centrality and visualization analysis and a filtering of salient terms of research hotspots in dance teaching using CiteSpace, a knowledge graph visualization software. Also, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model is used to extract and visualize the topics from the filtered salient terms of the abstracts. Results/Conclusion: We found that the research hotspots in dance teaching in China can be divided into 16 clusters, namely 'Sports Dance', 'Dance Art', 'Classical Chinese Dance', 'Yunnan Dance', 'Dance', 'Folk Dance', 'Ethnic Dance'. 'Dance teaching', 'Quality Education', 'College Students', 'Ethnic Minorities'. 'Latin Dance', 'Traditional Athletic Maintenance', 'Chorus', 'Fitness Value', and 'Physical Fitness'. The research frontiers in dance teaching lie in the teaching, discovery, protection, restoration, and discipline construction of folk dance and intangible cultural heritage dance genres.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - We propose a method for entity matching that takes into account the characteristic complex properties of decentralized cultural heritage data sources, where multiple data sources may contain duplicates within and between sources. We apply the proposed method to historical data from the Amsterdam City Archives using several clustering algorithms and evaluate the results against a partial ground truth. We also evaluate our method on a semi-synthetic data set for which we have a complete ground truth. The results show that the proposed method for entity matching performs well and is able to handle the complex properties of historical data sources. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Recent years have seen significant interest in multimodal frameworks for modeling learner engagement in educational settings. Multimodal frameworks hold particular promise for predicting visitor engagement in interactive science museum exhibits. Multimodal models often utilize video data to capture learner behavior, but video cameras are not always feasible, or even desirable, to use in museums. To address this issue while still harnessing the predictive capacities of multimodal models, we investigate adversarial discriminative domain adaptation for generating modality-invariant representations of both unimodal and multimodal data captured from museum visitors as they engage with interactive science museum exhibits. This approach enables the use of pre-trained multimodal visitor engagement models in circumstances where multimodal instrumentation is not available. We evaluate the visitor engagement models in terms of early prediction performance using exhibit interaction and facial expression data captured during visitor interactions with a science museum exhibit for environmental sustainability. Through the use of modality-invariant data representations generated by the adversarial discriminative domain adaptation framework, we find that pre-trained multimodal models achieve competitive predictive performance on interaction-only data compared to models evaluated using complete multimodal data. The multimodal framework outperforms unimodal and non-adapted baseline approaches during early intervals of exhibit interactions as well as entire interaction sequences. © EDM 2021.All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim is to make appropriate reflections on artificial intelligence AI through the differences in cognitive systems between intelligent digital libraries and well-trained experts, especially scientists. The method is: first, compare the difference and connection between data structure and knowledge reserve, then compare the difference and connection between query, retrieval or search algorithm path, finally, compare the difference and connection between cognitive computing and cognitive ability. Its characteristics are: data query or search algorithm and logical reasoning or cognitive computing, knowledge graph and cognitive graph are all conducive to the construction of intelligent digital library. The result is: it is found that whether it is based on rules or statistics or a combination of the two cognitive systems, there are limitations in cognitive computing and cognitive ability or intelligence. Its significance lies in: from this we can at least reflect on the theoretical limits of AI and some worthy questions, such as the calculability problem and Turing test problem and the Chinese Room Argument of the intelligent digital library. The problem of isomorphism with the information processing mode of the intelligent digital computer, and why can’t the intelligent digital library become a well-trained expert or even a scientist, and so on are worthy of the philosophy of logic and mind with Cognitive Science. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Underwater cultural heritage sites represent an attractive and exciting experience for diving tourists, even if often it is complicated for them to understand the significance and value of the remains that are usually strongly damaged and covered by the marine organisms. Thanks to the recent advancements in technologies that overcome these problems, augmented reality is nowadays possible even in such harsh conditions, opening new possibilities for enhancing the diver's experience. However, no user study has formally evaluated the usefulness and usability of augmented reality in open sea underwater environments. This paper presents two novel solutions for underwater augmented reality: a compact marker-based system for small areas, and a complex acoustic system for large areas. Both of them were deployed at an underwater cultural heritage site and evaluated by ten divers in experiments analyzing their perception and remembrance, interests, and user experience. For comparison, the same study was also performed with non-divers assessing the marker-based system on land. Results show that both systems allow divers to encounter new and exciting moments and provide valuable insights for underwater augmented reality applications.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Libraries and documentation centers haven’t a methodology guide to transform their RDF data into knowledge graphs, which prevents them from taking advantage of the facilities of this tool in the search and retrieval of information. This methodology was proposed for the transformation of bibliographic data in knowledge graphs. ANCORP was presented from the analysis of the techniques of incrustation, cleaning and checking of knowledge graphs. This methodology was divided into two parts: part I dedicated to the construction of the knowledge graph, and part II dedicated to solving the processes of information retrieval. With the implementation of the methodology, qualitative leaps in the information retrieval and in the quality of the data are corroborated. © 2021, Centro Nacional de Informacion de Ciencias Medicas.

AB  - The purpose of the paper is to assess the state of the art in the co-existence of blockchain technology with other 4.0 technologies that are used for supply chain management and to identify examples of solutions that can support the construction of resilient chains. The paper also aims to identify future research directions that are extensions of the primary objective. Therefore, a coalescence of coexisting 4.0 technologies that can support the construction of resilient supply chains is proposed. For this purpose, secondary data from SCOPUS was used, as well as the author's program, jVectorMap library (https://jvectormap.com/ ), and data from collaboratively edited multilingual knowledge graph – Wikidata (https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page ). Among other things, the authors identified four geographic clusters, in which blockchain coexistence with other 4.0 technologies is written about the most. However, only a few studies examined the synergistic effect between the two. It was also found that the least discussed attribute of resilient blockchains in the context of 4.0 technologies is supply chain agility. Moreover, other attributes like transparency, security and trust in supply chains can be further developed by using blockchain technology with the support of other technologies. At the same time, it was found that research on this topic is at a very early stage of development. Based on the identified research gaps, it can be concluded that science in the subject area is not keeping up with the needs of the economy. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - When developing a knowledge graph, it is important to promote its (re)usability, accessibility, and persistence. One way of accomplishing (re)usability is through the principled use (i.e., using a structured development methodology) of a schema that describes and documents the relations between concepts in the knowledge graph. With respect to accessibility and persistence, one can consider exposing a SPARQL endpoint and allowing interested parties to query against it. While this is a very exible approach, it makes it difficult to explore the data. On the other hand, one could consider exposing data through a framework such as Wikibase. In this paper, we provide a small library of patterns that link between a traditional ontology design pattern and the underlying Wikibase data model. © 2021 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the most important elements of culture is painting, which reserves ethnic and national immaterial relics. However, Chinese Web is currently short of a specialized knowledge graph on museums and it still crave accesses to effectually assimilate extensive types of discrete knowledge for applications. To facilitate museum knowledge sharing, we propose a painting knowledge graph, namely PaintKG, utilizing Bi-LSTM with CRF layer which obviously rises the F-l measure to recognize and extract knowledge and relations of different types of paintings and their painters from existing encyclopedia and unstructured Web text data and physically restore them in neo4j as graph data eventually. What's more, we depict and demonstrate typical scenarios of PaintKG and implement them by real-world applications, such as painting recommendation, painter entity association.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - As digital libraries make the dissemination of research publications easier, they also enable the propagation of invalid or unreliable knowledge. Examples of relevant problems include: retraction and inadvertent citation and reuse of retracted papers [1], [2]; propagation of errors in literature and scientific databases [3], [4]; non-reproducible papers; known domain-specific issues such as cell line contamination [5]; bias in research datasets and publications [6]-[8]; systematic reviews that arrive at different conclusions about the same question at the same time [9], [10]. The digital environment facilitates broad interdisciplinary reuse beyond the originating scientific community; thus, marking known problems and tracing the impact on dependent and follow-on works is particularly important (but still under-addressed). Further, context-specific information inside a paper may not be immediately reusable when extracted by automated processes, leading to apparent contradictions [11]. Current mitigating approaches use the underlying reasoning for information retrieval [12], [13], develop new infrastructures analyzing the reasoning [14]-[16] or certainty [17] of statements, or use visualization to highlight possible discrepancies [10], [15]. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) establishes a new paradigm for learning graph representations without human annotations. Although remarkable progress has been witnessed recently, the success behind GCL is still left somewhat mysterious. In this work, we first identify several critical design considerations within a general GCL paradigm, including augmentation functions, contrasting modes, contrastive objectives, and negative mining strategies. Then, to understand the interplay of different GCL components, we conduct comprehensive, controlled experiments over benchmark tasks on datasets across various domains. Our empirical studies suggest a set of general receipts for effective GCL, e.g., simple topology augmentations that produce sparse graph views bring promising performance improvements; contrasting modes should be aligned with the granularities of end tasks. In addition, to foster future research and ease the implementation of GCL algorithms, we develop an easy-to-use library PyGCL, featuring modularized CL components, standardized evaluation, and experiment management. We envision this work to provide useful empirical evidence of effective GCL algorithms and offer several insights for future research. © 2021 Neural information processing systems foundation.

AB  - Wikidata is evolving as the hub of Linked Open Data (LOD), with its language-neutral URIs and close adherence to Wikipedia. Well defined URIs help the data to be interoperable and linkable. This paper examines the possibilities of utilizing Wikidata as the means of a vocabulary resource for promoting the use of linkable concepts. Digital curation projects are vibrant with varying demands and purposes, which makes them less suitable for adopting any common vocabularies or ontologies. Also, developing and maintaining custom vocabularies are expensive processes for smaller projects in terms of resources and skill requirements. In general, Wikidata entities are well documented with Wikipedia entries, and Wikipedia entries express the conceptual and hierarchical relations in detail with provisions to modify or create. The authors explain the concept of using Wikidata as a vocabulary source with a proof of concept module implementation for Omeka-S, a widely adapted open source digital curation platform. This paper is expected to show some practical insights on reliable an reasonable vocabulary development for social informatics as well as cultural heritage projects, with a notion to improve the quality and quantity of linkable data from digital curation projects. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The Cultural Heritage (CH) domain is a field where many different visual media are constituent elements of the main activities: study, conservation, dissemination, and presentation to the public (museum visitors, tourists, practitioners). Those media are usually used in isolation, adopting specific visualization tools. This paper aims to present several experiences where multiple visual media have been used in a coordinated manner by fusing or presenting them in the same visualization context. These approaches experimented with new interaction and visualization methodologies to use different media in a synergic way. CH domain is an ideal field of experimentation of the potential of media integration/fusion/ cross-analysis. According to our understanding, using multiple media can improve insight capability. We guide the reader in the analysis of some pioneering experiences and approaches and try to deduce, for each of them, the potential improvement granted in terms of data communication or analysis. A final discussion tries to highlight the work needed for a wider acceptance and increased impact of those approaches. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This paper presents a method for extracting and reassembling a genealogical network automatically from a biographical register of historical people. The method is applied to a dataset of short textual biographies about all 28 000 Finnish and Swedish academic people educated in 1640–1899 in Finland. The aim is to connect and disambiguate the relatives mentioned in the biographies in order to build a continuous, genealogical network, which can be used in Digital Humanities for data and network analysis of historical academic people and their lives. An artificial neural network approach is presented for solving a supervised learning task to disambiguate relatives mentioned in the register descriptions using basic biographical information enhanced with an ontology of vocations and additional occasionally sparse genealogical information. Evaluation results of the record linkage are promising and provide novel insights into the problem of historical people register reconciliation. The outcome of the work has been used in practise as part of the in-use AcademySampo portal and linked open data service, a new member in the Sampo series of cultural heritage applications for Digital Humanities. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Most libraries put a lot of effort into developing subject headings or thesauri, which are used to index and retrieve information. Nevertheless, in the library field, controlled vocabularies are associated to authority records as authority files. In order to become findable by search engines, these authority files should be modelled on semantic vocabularies. This research proposes an authority-record conversion process for publishing thesauri and subject headings as linked data, by using the Simple Knowledge Organization Systems data model. To this purpose, we undertook a bibliographic and documentary research on the World Wide Web Consortium recommendation guidelines, which were used to produce a set of procedures and technologies to support the conversion proposal. This research provides evidences that controlled vocabularies are an important resource for improving information retrieval on the web. The proposed conversion process works as a quick guide for controlled vocabulary integration and reuse among users and systems on the linked data environment. Although the proposal was originally intended for a library setting, it can be applied and tested in another type of institution, such as documentation centres, museums, or cultural heritage archives. It can also be used in other linked open data projects. © 2021 Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Campinas. All rights reserved.

AB  - Traditional cultural heritage education mainly relies on the museum's display design and supplementation of exogenous materials, and most digital cultural heritage displays are based on the same principle. This process makes it difficult for tourists to absorb cultural knowledge actively and effectively. This article proposes a serious game of cultural heritage education based on the experiential learning cycle model, which provides a single-player experience environment on the computer with 3D modeling in the context of cultural heritages, and strengthens people's active construction of cultural heritage knowledge through game narrative, interaction and knowledge cards. Subsequently, a user test was conducted to verify whether the game design plays a role in real users. A total of 55 postgraduates participated in the experiment. Results show that The proposed design is feasible and can play a positive role in enhancing the learning effect, learning experience and learning initiative of learners, but more comprehensive tests are still needed to better investigate its use in formal education environments. © 2021 IEEE

AB  - RiC-O Converter is an open-source command-line tool to convert EAD finding aids and EAC-CPF authority records to RDF files conforming to Records in Contexts ontology, in a robust manner. It was developed for the Archives nationales of France (ANF) but is aimed to be reused by other archival institutions, and to this aim is fully documented in English. It is based on XSLT stylesheets that take into account the variability of EAD content. It enabled the ANF to convert 15000 EAC-CPF files and 29000 EAD files into an homogeneous knowledge graph. Such a graph opens new perspectives for navigating and linking from/to archival metadata. © Copyright 2021 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - It is an important task to connect encyclopaedic knowledge graphs by finding and linking the same entity nodes. Various available automated linking solutions cannot be applied in situations where data is sparse, private or a high degree of correctness is expected. Wikidata has grown into a leading linking hub collecting entity identifiers from various registries and repositories. To get a picture of connectability, we analysed the linking methods and results between the COURAGE registry and Wikidata, VIAF, ISNI and ULAN. This paper describes our investigations and solutions while mapping and enriching entities in Wikidata. Each possible mapped pair of entities received a numeric score of reliability. Using this score-based matching method, we tried to minimise the need for human decisions, hence we introduced the term human decision window for the mappings where neither acceptance nor refusal can be made automatically and safely. Furthermore, Wikidata has been enriched with related COURAGE entities and bi-directional links between mapped persons, organisations, collections, and collection items. We also describe the findings on coverage and quality of mapping among the above mentioned authority databases. Copyright © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - ［Purpose/Significance］The empowerment of digital intelligence has bought a new growth point for interdisciplinary integration and development of various disciplines and fields. Library and information science is a research, teaching and application field, which studies knowledge exchange of multiple fields and provides digital academic supportive environment through knowledge organization methodology and technology. This study aims to study how it could make possible contribution to interdisciplinary integration in digital humanities as well as obtain new achievements.［Design/Methodology］ By investigating the current status, problems and interdisciplinary integration trend of Historical Geography Informatization(HGI) with literature research and expert interview, this paper analyzed the application of metadata, ontology, linked data and knowledge graph as knowledge organization methods and technologies in solving the problems of HGI from the two dimensions, i.e.knowledge organization of historical geography materials and contents.［Findings/Conclusion］The methods and technologies of knowledge organization in digital intelligence era can provide a solution for the knowledge organization of historical materials and contents in HGI, which also provides a method and reference for the co-construction, sharing and longterm preservation of database for special topic research.［Originality/Value］Library and information science can participate in the interdisciplinary integration of humanities according to four paradigms: providing infrastructure for the long-term preservation of digital resources and research data, providing method reference for developing standards and specifications of historical data and materials digitization, providing high-level interoperability framework for cross-domain knowledge consilience, and providing data middle platform services for the co-construction and sharing of digital resources and research data. © 2021 Editorial Office of Documentation, Information and Knowledge.

AB  - Archival records are essential sources of information for historians and digital humanists to understand history. For modern information systems they are often analysed and integrated into Knowledge Graphs for better access, interoperability and re-use. However, due to restrictions of the representation of RDF predicates temporal data within archival records is a challenge to model. This position paper explains requirements for modeling temporal data in archival records based on running research projects in which archival records are analysed and integrated in Knowledge Graphs for research and exploration. © Copyright 2021 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Observing and analyzing human behavior is a labor-intensive task. Video data is a crucially important resource for ethnographical study, but the accessibility is limited because describing the semantics of video content is difficult. Moreover, the user typically must watch the entire video archive to identify important findings. This study aims to make human behavior computable and utilize it in various domains such as user-centric manufacturing and safety management. To this end, the work proposes an ontology and a semantic video indexing methodology that integrates human annotation and DNN detector-based annotations of video content and converts them into a knowledge graph. This knowledge graph of ontology-based human actions enables us to apply various computational algorithms to human behaviors. The reported proof of concept system retrieves multimodal data, represents every human behavior annotations as an RDF knowledge graph (KG), and exploits the KG to analyze behavior patterns. As a case study, the work was evaluated in the elderly care domain. A formal notation was used to retrieve complex action sequences with specific conditions. The system was validated to retrieve complex behavior patterns and display the location of such behavioral events in the video.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - The knowledge of the European silk textile production is a typical case for which the information collected is heterogeneous, spread across many museums and sparse since rarely complete. Knowledge Graphs for this cultural heritage domain, when being developed with appropriate ontologies and vocabularies, enable to integrate and reconcile this diverse information. However, many of these original museum records still have some metadata gaps. In this paper, we present a zero-shot learning approach that leverages the ConceptNet common sense knowledge graph to predict categorical metadata informing about the silk objects production. We compared the performance of our approach with traditional supervised deep learning-based methods that do require training data. We demonstrate promising and competitive performance for similar datasets and circumstances and the ability to predict sometimes more fine-grained information.

AB  - Knowledge graphs are essential for digital libraries to store entity-centric knowledge. The applications of knowledge graphs range from summarizing entity information over answering complex queries to inferring new knowledge. Yet, building knowledge graphs means either relying on manual curation or designing supervised extraction processes to harvest knowledge from unstructured text. Obviously, both approaches are cost-intensive. Yet, the question is whether we can minimize the efforts to build a knowledge graph. And indeed, we propose a toolbox that provides methods to extract knowledge from arbitrary text. Our toolkit bypasses the need for supervision nearly completely and includes a novel algorithm to close the missing gaps. As a practical demonstration, we analyze our toolbox on established biomedical benchmarks. As far as we know, we are the first who propose, analyze and share a nearly unsupervised and complete toolbox for building knowledge graphs from text. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Background: The study of adverse childhood experiences and their consequences has emerged over the past 20 years. Although the conclusions from these studies are available, the same is not true of the data. Accordingly, it is a complex problem to build a training set and develop machine-learning models from these studies. Classic machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques cannot provide a full scientific understanding of the inner workings of the underlying models. This raises credibility issues due to the lack of transparency and generalizability. Explainable artificial intelligence is an emerging approach for promoting credibility, accountability, and trust in mission-critical areas such as medicine by combining machine-learning approaches with explanatory techniques that explicitly show what the decision criteria are and why (or how) they have been established. Hence, thinking about how machine learning could benefit from knowledge graphs that combine “common sense” knowledge as well as semantic reasoning and causality models is a potential solution to this problem. Objective: In this study, we aimed to leverage explainable artificial intelligence, and propose a proof-of-concept prototype for a knowledge-driven evidence-based recommendation system to improve mental health surveillance. Methods: We used concepts from an ontology that we have developed to build and train a question-answering agent using the Google DialogFlow engine. In addition to the question-answering agent, the initial prototype includes knowledge graph generation and recommendation components that leverage third-party graph technology. Results: To showcase the framework functionalities, we here present a prototype design and demonstrate the main features through four use case scenarios motivated by an initiative currently implemented at a children’s hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Ongoing development of the prototype requires implementing an optimization algorithm of the recommendations, incorporating a privacy layer through a personal health library, and conducting a clinical trial to assess both usability and usefulness of the implementation. Conclusions: This semantic-driven explainable artificial intelligence prototype can enhance health care practitioners’ ability to provide explanations for the decisions they make. ©Nariman Ammar, Arash Shaban-Nejad.

AB  - Graphic symbols i.e. graphic entities drawn as a visual unit in a written text and representing something other or something more than a word of that text are the research object of the NOTAE project, which investigates them in the documentary practice of the late Roman State and Post-Roman Kingdoms (400-800 AD). While research results from the project are stored by filling forms resulting from the analysis of ancient documents, we argue that the availability of a navigable knowledge graph can ease the work of researchers at finding non trivial implications in data. In this paper, we propose a first version of the NOTAE Knowledge Graph, and we outline future works and possible synergies. Copyright © 2021 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Customised Named Entity Recognition is an interesting, yet challenging task. The focus of our paper is the extraction of the named entities that provide financial information about research projects and programs. We introduce AckNER, a tool which extracts financial information from the “Acknowledgments” or “Funding” sections of research articles and dissertations. The results show that AckNER outperforms generic NLP libraries such as SpaCy, Stanza, FLAIR and DeepPavlov. The improvements found can be attributed to the ability to identify non-capitalised parts of the named entities in combination with the addition of patterns to extract information about contracts and grants. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the whole world scenario and made researchers innovate on the corona virus. Researchers are working on information that includes symptoms, Infection spreading, preventive measures, health and travel advisories, and help lines for further assistance. During this pandemic scenario, the health assistant Chatbot is a very useful conversation tool for COVID-19, which provides preliminary medical advice and preventive measure suggestions. The paper proposes an Artificial Intelligence-based Re-Co Chatbot to provide information about the corona virus and also assist with customer queries. The goal is to build a 24/7 COVID Chatbot capable of answering user questions and to emphasize and stress the concept of contextual semantic search and Knowledge Graph to serve as the FAQ for Corona information. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used to process the user question and the SpaCy library is used for text processing. Once the question is processed, entities (the subject of question) and relations (predicate of the question) are recognized and extracted. The Chatbot is designed for about 100 question-answers pairs in the CSV file and will create about 575 relationships in the Knowledge Graph. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Art-historic documents often contain multimodal data in terms of images of artworks and metadata, descriptions, or interpretations thereof. Most research efforts have focused either on image analysis or text analysis independently since the associations between the two modes are usually lost during digitization. In this work, we focus on the task of alignment of images and textual descriptions in art-historic digital collections. To this end, we reproduce an existing approach that learns alignments in a semi-supervised fashion. We identify several challenges while automatically aligning images and texts, specifically for the cultural heritage domain, which limit the scalability of previous works. To improve the performance of alignment, we introduce various enhancements to extend the existing approach that show promising results. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Presently, medical professionals and researchers face a dire problem trying to identify important and subject specific documents for medical research. This is mainly owing to the fact that there is a disconnection in the pipeline for finding essential documents via a common platform which can parse and link the complex medical terminologies. To solve this problem, a model is generated, which creates a Semi-automated ontology and Knowledge-graph for link prediction using unstructured medical documents. To extract entities from a document is a tiresome task but can be achieved using multiple resources like DBPedia, pretrained statistical models on English provided by spaCy. Though, for biomedical data above two are not enough, as another key challenge with biomedical data is with its commonly occurring abbreviated names and noun compounds containing punctuation, which might lead to misidentification. To overcome this problem and also to train this model more medical specific, [bionlp13cg] model provided by scispaCy is used. It is a spaCy NER model trained on the BIONLP13CG corpus. This model not only extracts entities which are more specific to the medical domain, but also label them according to the category they belong to. All the entities are classified into subclass and main-class using ontologies. Hence link is predicted between two entities according to the categories they belong to. Ontology is created using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) RDF. It is a linked data representation of the MeSH biomedical vocabulary produced by the National Library of Medicine, thereby it provides precise results. Since, some entities are not identified by Mesh, they are first categorized using labels obtained by scispaCy, if it is recognized by latter. Further these categories are mapped to MeSH Ontology to enhance the precision of linked entities. Since this model is graph enabled, it gives users a very specific relation between medical terminologies. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Aggregation services are, for now, a necessary reality in the world of linked open data. This chapter looks at some of the benefits and tradeoffs that come with the aggregation of linked open data, before looking at the specific case of the Swedish Open Cultural Heritage (SOCH) national aggregator. By gathering disparate but thematically related data sets and republishing them in a common format, aggregators not only make data more accessible and discoverable, but also place it within a wider context. However, there are concomitant design compromises which must be made. SOCH is a national aggregator for heritage data in Sweden. Since 2010 it has harvested data from museums, archives and historic environment registers, and published them as linked open data mapped to a common data model and made them questionable via a web application programming interface (API). SOCH now aggregates more than 9 million records from more than 75 Swedish heritage institutions. Over its ten-year lifespan, SOCH has had significant success in opening up Swedish heritage data. However, as an early adopter of linked open data in Swedish heritage, there are nonetheless challenges to be addressed in future development. © 2022 Koraljka Golub and Ying-Hsang Liu.

AB  - This paper presents the in-use AcademySampo portal and Linked Open Data (LOD) service for biographical and prosopographical research, a new member in the Sampo series of cultural heritage applications for Digital Humanities. The portal is based on a dataset of short textual biographies about all 28 000 Finnish and Swedish academic people educated in 1640 1899 in Finland. Linked data extracted from the biography entries was enriched by internal and external data linking, and by reasoning, e.g., genealogical networks of the people mentioned. The data was published as a LOD service. This paper demonstrates how to use the AcademySampo data in Digital Humanities research by faceted search integrated seamlessly with data analytic tools of the AcademySampo portal, as well as by using the LOD service directly via a SPARQL editor and by Python scripting using Google Colab and Jupyter notebooks. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

AB  - In the last years cultural heritage institutions have radically changed the way they publish their data. Publishing Linked Open Data (LOD) offers many advantages, in terms of innovation, visibility, and engagement with patrons. New data are served along with legacy services and data, via dedicated interfaces that allow developers and Digital Humanists to access specialised information. However, Linked data are living entities that change over time and require expensive curatorial activities, and should not be misaligned with respect to original data. To cope with this problem, several LOD-native cataloguing systems have been created. In this article an overview of current projects for LOD-native cataloguing is provided. Projects and systems are analysed with respect to related problems and benefits. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for the analysis of mesoscopic and atomically resolved images and spectroscopy in electron and scanning probe microscopy, with the applications ranging from feature extraction to information compression and elucidation of relevant order parameters to inversion of imaging data to reconstruct structural models. However, the fundamental limitation of machine learning methods is their correlative nature, leading to extreme susceptibility to confounding factors. Here, we implement the workflow for causal analysis of structural scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) data and explore the interplay between physical and chemical effects in a ferroelectric perovskite across the ferroelectric–antiferroelectric phase transitions. The combinatorial library of the Sm-doped BiFeO3 is grown to cover the composition range from pure ferroelectric BFO to orthorhombic 20% Sm-doped BFO. Atomically resolved STEM images are acquired for selected compositions and are used to create a set of local compositional, structural, and polarization field descriptors. The information-geometric causal inference (IGCI) and additive noise model (ANM) analysis are used to establish the pairwise causal directions between the descriptors, ordering the data set in the causal direction. The causal chain for IGCI and ANM across the composition is compared and suggests the presence of common causal mechanisms across the composition series. Ultimately, we believe that the causal analysis of the multimodal data will allow exploring the causal links between multiple competing mechanisms that control the emergence of unique functionalities of morphotropic materials and ferroelectric relaxors. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.

AB  - Recent years have seen a growing interest in investigating visitor engagement in science museums with multimodal learning analytics. Visitor engagement is a multidimensional process that unfolds temporally over the course of a museum visit. In this paper, we introduce a multimodal trajectory analysis framework for modeling visitor engagement with an interactive science exhibit for environmental sustainability. We investigate trajectories of multimodal data captured during visitor interactions with the exhibit through slope-based time series analysis. Utilizing the slopes of the time series representations for each multimodal data channel, we conduct an ablation study to investigate how additional modalities lead to improved accuracy while modeling visitor engagement. We are able to enhance visitor engagement models by accounting for varying levels of visitors’ science fascination, a construct integrating science interest, curiosity, and mastery goals. The results suggest that trajectory-based representations of the multimodal visitor data can serve as the foundation for visitor engagement modeling to enhance museum learning experiences. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - While realizing global coverage, random access, on-demand service, security and credibility, the space-integrated-ground information network(SGIN) is confronted with more complex and variable security threats. Compared with the internet, satellite network has a lot of differences, such as highly dynamic changes of topology, transfer protocol and data format. In terms of these questions, it was necessary to integrated the rule of satellite network attacks into the rules of APT attacks, developed the cybersecurity knowledge graph and the attack rules library to analyzed the attacks of the SGIN. The pattern of attack rules was expressed based on time-space data model, which was used to completed the attack chain when there were non-continuous missed data or false positives data. The attack analysis framework proposed in this paper could accurately perceived the security status of the SGIN in real time, and provided decision support for the SGIN. © 2021 Authors.

AB  - The Second World War (WW2) is arguably the most devastating catastrophe of human history, a topic of great interest to not only researchers but the general public. However, data about the Second World War is heterogeneous and distributed in various organizations and countries making it hard to utilize. In order to create aggregated global views of the war, a shared ontology and data infrastructure is needed to harmonize information in various data silos. This makes it possible to share data between publishers and application developers, to support data analysis in Digital Humanities research, and to develop data-driven intelligent applications. As a first step towards these goals, this article presents the WarSampo knowledge graph (KG), a shared semantic infrastructure, and a Linked Open Data (LOD) service for publishing data about WW2, with a focus on Finnish military history. The shared semantic infrastructure is based on the idea of representing war as a spatio-temporal sequence of events that soldiers, military units, and other actors participate in. The used metadata schema is an extension of CIDOC CRM, supplemented by various military history domain ontologies. With an infrastructure containing shared ontologies, maintaining the interlinked data brings upon new challenges, as one change in an ontology can propagate across several datasets that use it. To support sustainability, a repeatable automatic data transformation and linking pipeline has been created for rebuilding the whole WarSampo KG from the individual source datasets. The WarSampo KG is hosted on a data service based on W3C Semantic Web standards and best practices, including content negotiation, SPARQL API, download, automatic documentation, and other services supporting the reuse of the data. The WarSampo KG, a part of the international LOD Cloud and totalling ca. 14 million triples, is in use in nine end-user application views of the WarSampo portal, which has had over 690 000 end users since its opening in 2015.  © 2021 - IOS Press.

AB  - There is an immediate need to study COVID-19, and the COVID-19 Data Archive (COVID-ARC) provides access to data along with user-friendly tools for researchers to perform analyses to better understand COVID-19 and encourage collaboration on this research. The COVID-19 pandemic has been spreading rapidly across the world, and there are still many unknowns about COVID-19. There is an urgent need for scientists around the world to work together to model the virus, study how the virus has changed and will change over time, understand how it spreads, and study transmission after vaccination. COVID-ARC can also prepare scientists for future pandemics by putting the infrastructure in place to enable researchers to aggregate data and perform analyses quickly in the event of an emergency. We have developed a platform of networked and centralized web-accessible data archives to store multimodal data related to COVID-19 and make them broadly available and accessible to the world-wide scientific community to expedite research in this area. COVID-ARC provides tools for researchers to visualize and analyze various types of data as well as a website with tools for training, announcements, virtual information sessions, and a knowledgebase wherein researchers post questions and receive answers from the community. © 2021, International Press, Inc..

AB  - The current trends in society evolution are showing rapid changes in our habitual environments and consequently affecting human interactions with them. Among the key factors of this process we can certainly cite the growth of BigData favored by the knowledge digitalization, the dissemination of sensors in environments and the advancements of connectivity capabilities. At the same time, the progress in artificial intelligence and cognitive robotics has lead to the production of sophisticated humanoid robots, which are progressively spreading to a wide public. In this way, research efforts are needed for a proper knowledge management and knowledge acquisition by machines, in order to have more natural and friendly human-robot interactions in daily tasks, usually performed by human beings. In this paper we show an approach related to a human-robot interaction in cultural heritage context, simulating a digital ecosystem where a robot plays the role of a guide for tourists and it is able to proactively interact with its interlocutors by combining both semantic and visual information. The proposed approach, its implementation and experimental results on a real robotic platform are shown and discussed.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - An important part in European cultural identity relies on European cities and in particular on their histories and cultural heritage. Nuremberg, the home of important artists such as Albrecht Durer and Hans Sachs developed into the epitome of German and European culture already during the Middle Ages. Throughout history, the city experienced a number of transformations, especially with its almost complete destruction during World War 2. This position paper presents TRANSRAZ, a project with the goal to recreate Nuremberg by means of an interactive 3D tool to explore the city's architecture and culture ranging from the 17th to the 21st century. The goal of this position paper is to discuss the ongoing work of connecting heterogeneous historical data from various sources previously hidden in archives to the 3D model using knowledge graphs for a scientifically accurate interactive exploration on the Web.

AB  - Recently, knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) have received significant attention, and several software libraries have been developed for training and evaluation. While each of them addresses specific needs, we report on a community effort to a re-design and re-implementation of PyKEEN, one of the early KGE libraries. PyKEEN 1.0 enables users to compose knowledge graph embedding models based on a wide range of interaction models, training approaches, loss functions, and permits the explicit modeling of inverse relations. It allows users to measure each component’s influence individually on the model’s performance. Besides, an automatic memory optimization has been realized in order to optimally exploit the provided hardware. Through the integration of Optuna, extensive hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) functionalities are provided. © 2021 Mehdi Ali, Max Berrendorf, Charles Tapley Hoyt, Laurent Vermue, Sahand Sharifzadeh, Volker Tresp, and Jens Lehmann.

AB  - Virtual heritage has been explained as virtual reality applied to cultural heritage, but this definition only scratches the surface of the fascinating applications, tools and challenges of this fast-changing interdisciplinary field. This book provides an accessible but concise edited coverage of the main topics, tools and issues in virtual heritage. Leading international scholars have provided chapters to explain current issues in accuracy and precision; challenges in adopting advanced animation techniques; shows how archaeological learning can be developed in Minecraft; they propose mixed reality is conceptual rather than just technical; they explore how useful Linked Open Data can be for art history; explain how accessible photogrammetry can be but also ethical and practical issues for applying at scale; provide insight into how to provide interaction in museums involving the wider public; and describe issues in evaluating virtual heritage projects not often addressed even in scholarly papers. The book will be of particular interest to students and scholars in museum studies, digital archaeology, heritage studies, architectural history and modelling, virtual environments. © Erik Malcolm Champion 2021.

AB  - Cultural heritage portals have the goal of providing users with seamless access to all their resources. This paper introduces initial e_orts for a user-oriented restructuring of the German Digital Library (DDB). At present, cultural heritage objects (CHOs) in the DDB are modeled using an extended version of the Europeana Data Model (DDBEDM), which negatively impacts usability and exploration. These challenges can be addressed by leveraging ontologies, and building a knowledge graph from the DDB's voluminous collection. Towards this goal, an alignment of bibliographic metadata from DDB-EDM to FRBR-Aligned Bibliographic Ontology (FaBiO) is presented. © 2021 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Our ability to generate, collect, and archive data related to everyday activities, such as interacting on social media, browsing the web, and monitoring well-being, is rapidly increasing. Getting the most benefit from this large-scale data requires analysis of patterns it contains, which is computationally intensive or even intractable. Summarization techniques produce compact data representations (summaries) that enable faster processing by complex algorithms and queries. This talk will cover summarization of interconnected data (graphs) [3], which can represent a variety of natural processes (e.g., friendships, communication). I will present an overview of my group’s work on bridging the gap between research on summarized network representations and real-world problems. Examples include summarization of massive knowledge graphs for refinement [2] and on-device querying [4], summarization of graph streams for persistent activity detection [1], and summarization within graph neural networks for fast, interpretable classification [5]. I will conclude with open challenges and opportunities for future research. © 2021, VLDB Endowment. All rights reserved.

AB  - ArrayExpress (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) is an archive of functional genomics data at EMBL-EBI, established in 2002, initially as an archive for publication-related microarray data and was later extended to accept sequencing-based data. Over the last decade an increasing share of biological experiments involve multiple technologies assaying different biological modalities, such as epigenetics, and RNA and protein expression, and thus the BioStudies database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies) was established to deal with such multimodal data. Its central concept is a study, which typically is associated with a publication. BioStudies stores metadata describing the study, provides links to the relevant databases, such as European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), as well as hosts the types of data for which specialized databases do not exist. With BioStudies now fully functional, we are able to further harmonize the archival data infrastructure at EMBL-EBI, and ArrayExpress is being migrated to BioStudies. In future, all functional genomics data will be archived at BioStudies. The process will be seamless for the users, who will continue to submit data using the online tool Annotare and will be able to query and download data largely in the same manner as before. Nevertheless, some technical aspects, particularly programmatic access, will change. This update guides the users through these changes.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Libraries have been digitizing their collections for years in order to provide users with enhanced access and improve preservation of library materials. This article studies how the linked data can be used to describe objects in the digital collections. Researchers selected a digital collection of the nineteenth-century British novels from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Library, and converted the metadata for 7,829 British novels from MARCXML to BIBFRAME 2.0. Their project demonstrates that the BIBFRAME 2.0 model is a feasible way to enhance the discoverability of digital collections within and beyond library communities. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Semantic enrichment methods may be used to identify relevant entities in textual documents. These extracted entities are part of knowledge graphs and thus linked by semantic relationships. This work explores the idea of navigating the semantic relationships among extracted entities as a way to search a text corpus. A modular software system (including document management, semantic enrichment, data consolidation, and data integration) has been designed, to offer a visual user interface for such navigation on top of an arbitrary corpus of textual documents. The software, called arca, has been used in a real use case: to search in the book catalogue of a publishing house. The evaluation carried out with a set of potential users has shown so far the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach. Critical issues and potential limitations of the paradigm have also been found and are discussed. Copyright © 2021 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - This paper presents a new software framework, Sampo-UI, for developing user interfaces for semantic portals. The goal is to provide the end-user with multiple application perspectives to Linked Data knowledge graphs, and a two-step usage cycle based on faceted search combined with ready-to-use tooling for data analysis. For the software developer, the Sampo-UI framework makes it possible to create highly customizable, user-friendly, and responsive user interfaces using current state-of-the-art JavaScript libraries and data from SPARQL endpoints, while saving substantial coding effort. Sampo-UI is published on GitHub under the open MIT License and has been utilized in several internal and external projects. The framework has been used thus far in creating six published and five forth-coming portals, mostly related to the Cultural Heritage domain, that have had tens of thousands of end-users on the Web.  © 2022 - The authors.

AB  - This paper presents the linked data representation of the National Library of Latvia (NLL) authority data consisting of topical, geographic name and form/genre thesauri. It is an important step from a data silo (MARC 21 data) to linked open datasets, represented using SKOS, that can be reused both within and outside the library domain. The datasets are converted to SKOS using mc2skos and are published as linked data using the Skosmos application for publishing SKOS datasets. The paper describes the datasets, including information about their external links. The NLL topical terms dataset, in particular, contains many external links – 85% of its concepts have links to the Library of Congress subject headings dataset that is available as linked open data. The published datasets can be applied to interconnecting Latvia’s cultural heritage information by describing museum and archive items with URIs from these datasets. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In order to more efficiently meet people's in-depth needs for knowledge acquisition and research, and to more effectively develop and use "the Canton Canon"historical archives, we designed and constructed the Canton Revolutionary History Knowledge Graph based on the revolutionary archives of Canton during the Republic of China. We associated the knowledge graph with the document corpus, transformed and combined the traditional digital library from document information management to knowledge management, and proposed a double-Layer retrieval mode of the document corpus based on the knowledge graph. At the same time, we developed "the Canton Canon"digital library based on the knowledge graph, and introduced the design and application of the digital library. It provides a great example of how to use huge archives more efficiently and build a more open digital library. What's more, it also opens up new ideas for the transformation of Chinese digital libraries from information management to knowledge management.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Background and objective: Modern imaging scanners produce an ever-growing body of 3D/4D multimodal data requiring image analytics and visualization of fused images, segmentations, and information. For the latter, augmented reality (AR) with head-mounted displays (HMDs) has shown potential. This work describes a framework (FI3D) for interactive immersion with data, integration of image processing and analytics, and rendering and fusion with an AR interface. Methods: The FI3D was designed and endowed with modules to communicate with peripherals, including imaging scanners and HMDs, and to provide computational power for data acquisition and processing. The core of FI3D is deployed to a dedicated computational unit that performs the computationally demanding processes in real-time, and the HMD is used as a display output peripheral and an input peripheral through gestures and voice commands. FI3D offers user-made processing and analysis dedicated modules. Users can customize and optimize these for a particular workflow while incorporating current or future libraries. Results: The FI3D framework was used to develop a workflow for processing, rendering, and visualization of CINE MRI cardiac sets. In this version, the data were loaded from a remote database, and the endocardium and epicardium of the left ventricle (LV) were segmented using a machine learning model and transmitted to a HoloLens HMD to be visualized in 4D. Performance results show that the system is capable of maintaining an image stream of one image per second with a resolution of 512 × 512. Also, it can modify visual properties of the holograms at 1 update per 16 milliseconds (62.5 Hz) while providing enough resources for the segmentation and surface reconstruction tasks without hindering the HMD. Conclusions: We provide a system design and framework to be used as a foundation for medical applications that benefit from AR visualization, removing several technical challenges from the developmental pipeline. © 2020

AB  - The scope and application of present web technology in the library and information sector have been increasingly transforming in terms of storage, processing, and delivery of services. Libraries, information centers, archives, museums, etc. are being driven to add meaningful and interoperable web-based library services to address the growing information needs of the users. One of the major developments in recent times is the adoption of semantic web technologies in providing web-based library services. Semantic web technology is an advanced web interface that offers structured webbased data and allows organizations or institutions to describe, communicate, retrieve and re-distribute over the web. It enables the library community to include additional information from other external resources to provide enriched information services to the users. Transformation, integration, and publication of library data as linked open data (LOD) is one such service. A library database typically holds two types of data viz., bibliographic data and authority data. There are many types of authority data that include personal names, corporate names, meeting names, geographic names, chronological terms, topical terms, etc. A personal name authority record provides several attributes of a person who may be an author, a contributor, an editor, a translator, an illustrator, etc., and acts as a preferred term or an access point for the library online catalogue service. The main objective of this paper is to transform MARC 21-based personal name authority data of a Koha database to RDF triple format and publish them as Linked Open Data (LOD) with enrichment of external LOD personal name authority datasets like Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF), Virtual International Authority File (VIAF), etc. Personal name authority LOD dataset adds a persistent URI to each personal name heading and makes the data easily accessible over the web. A Workflow Model (Figure-1) has been proposed to visualize the steps, operations, and components for converting personal name authority data to a LOD dataset. OpenRefine (version 3.2, https://openrefine.org/), an open-source tool, is used for the cleansing, reconciliation, and transformation of unstructured and messy data. In this research work, the OpenRefine tool has played a crucial role in facilitating a wide range of activities, from data refinement to the insertion of the URI column, link generation, reconciliation of external data sources, conversion of source format to different RDF formats such as RDF/XML, N-triples, Turtle, JSON-LD, etc. The produced personal name authority LOD dataset may further be used by the organizations or institutions for their advanced online catalogue service. © 2021.

AB  - The paper reviews the projects developed by Euro- peana to show the role that digitization, linked open data and cultural heritage can play in strengthening the cultural tourism sector. A series of basic statistical data about tourism and cultural tourism is provided to frame it as an economic sector. The fundamental strategies of the European institutions on cultural tourism are re- viewed, as well as the preponderant role they assign to Europeana. These strategies have been disrupted and accelerated in response to the economic debacle caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The main strate- gic plans of the Government of Spain for the develop- ment of the economy, research and innovation and for the digital transformation of Public Administrations are mentioned, having in mind the role that these plans as- sign to cultural tourism and memory institutions. © 2021 Prensas Universitarias de Zaragoza.

AB  - Digitized sources and digital methods are changing the way that we do history. For historians of the British Empire, the digital age offers new possibilities for investigating the lives of those who moved around the empire and across the world. However, much discussion of the possibilities and problems of digital history have focused on the creation and use of full text resources, skipping over the analytical opportunities offered by the descriptive systems in which those texts are embedded. This article is an attempt to fill this gap by documenting a journey through archival data relating to nineteenth-century Chinese naturalization in the Pacific Rim settler colonies of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. We argue that such data stories are critical if we are to understand both possibilities and pitfalls of research in digital collections. © 2021 by University of Hawai‘i Press.

AB  - Despite the rise of the knowledge graph (KG) popularity, understanding SPARQL query results from a KG can be challenging for users. The use of data visualization tools, e.g., Wikidata Query Service and YASGUI, can help address this challenge. However, existing tools are either focused just on a specific KG or only provided as a web interface. This paper proposes VizKG, a framework that provides a wide range of visualizations for SPARQL query results over KGs. VizKG aims to assist users in extracting patterns and insights from data in KGs, and hence supporting further KG analysis. VizKG features a wrapper that links SPARQL query results and external visualization libraries by mapping query result variables to the required visualization components, currently allowing for 24 types of visualizations. Not only that, VizKG also includes visualization recommendations for arbitrary SPARQL query results as well as extension mechanisms for additional visualization types. In our evaluation, the visualization recommendation feature of VizKG achieves an accuracy of 87.8%. To demonstrate the usefulness of VizKG in practical settings, this paper also reports on use case evaluation over various domains and KGs. A Python-based, Jupyter Notebook friendly implementation of VizKG is openly available at https://pypi.org/project/VizKG/. Copyright © 2021 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Under the German government s initiative "NEUSTART Kultur", the German Digital Library or Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek (DDB) is undergoing improvements to enhance user-experience. As an initial step, emphasis is placed on creating a knowledge graph from the bibliographic record collection of the DDB. This paper discusses the challenges facing the DDB in terms of retrieval and the solutions in addressing them. In particular, limitations of the current data model or ontology to represent bibliographic metadata is analyzed through concrete examples. This study presents the complete ontological mapping from DDB-Europeana Data Model (DDB-EDM) to FaBiO, and a prototype of the DDB-KG made available as a SPARQL endpoint. The suitabiliy of the target ontology is demonstrated with SPARQL queries formulated from competency questions. © 2021 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The potential of rich semantic contents in Cultural Heritage (CH) data has not been fully realised for Digital Humanities (DH) research. Barriers to effective access to and integration of digital resources have contributed to creating discrete data silos and insufficient exposure of the semantic conditions for contextualising data. Semantic enrichment is a datafication strategy that applies semantic techniques to enhance the value of data. Using the Digital Dunhuang Project as a case study, this chapter provides an overview of why and how semantic enrichment can be employed in CH data enhancement as a basis for the construction of DH research infrastructure. To achieve this, we describe how the knowledge of domain experts and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology were combined to construct the Dunhuang Mural Thesaurus (DMT). Then, we describe the techniques of semantic analysis, linking and augmentation in order to publish the data as linked open data (LOD)-DMT to support the cultural study of Dunhuang, called Dunhuangology. This chapter provides not only a pilot application of the methods and techniques of semantic enrichment but also, a reference for galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAMs) committed to the construction of DH research infrastructures. © 2022 Koraljka Golub and Ying-Hsang Liu.

AB  - Global architecture as a trend has created an unbalanced visual identity by neglecting the cultural past and the traditional local architecture. This intellectual movement results in an emotional disconnection between the people and their locality. Al Ain of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) faces challenges when it comes to protecting its local architectural identity. At this point, UNICEF necessitates the participation of youth in perceiving and expressing ideas relative to their interactive visual built environments. Therefore, the study explores the potential of the 'brand image' of architecture for creating a sense of attachment in the children's minds towards their visual built environment. Centered on Personal Construct Psychology (PCP) (Kelly, 1955), a 'Brand Perception' framework based on the design principles of Interest, Pleasure, Desirability, Loyalty, and Recognition was established. An empirical study relying on RGT interviews was conducted on a random sample of 70 participants (Emirati and Indian, aged 7-12) from the city of Al Ain, UAE. The resultant emotional responses towards the 'photographic' stimuli of Local images (LI), Brand images (BI), Foreign images (FI), New images (NI), and Brand Indian images (BII), representing diverse architectural styles were validated using analysis of variances (ANOVA). For p<.05, the Emirati participants show a significant emotional attachment towards the architectural forms signified by the LI (T-value= 8.410, p = 0.000), BI (T-value= 11.920, p = 0.000) and BII (T-value= 7.770, p = 0.000). Whereas, the T and p values for Indian participants depict a significant inherent attachment towards the LI (T-value= 2.660, p = 0.009), NI (T-value= 2.980, p = 0.003) and BII (T-value= 1.250, p = 0.0214). Conversely, BII-3 (the Taj Mahal) creates a significant emotional response from the Emirati's only due to the resemblance in architectural visual expression to the Sheikh Zayed Mosque. The results suggest that the children are emotionally attached to the architecture of their locale. Exposure to Brand Images (BI) and Local Images (LI) representing the architecture of the locale imparted the highest emotional responses of loyalty (68.6%) and recognition (50%) in the Emiratis. Similarly, viewing the Brand India Images (BII) led to an increase in the Indian participant's emotional responses of loyalty (52.9%) and recognition (50.7%). Although NI influences the desirability of Indians, no significant effect is produced by FI and NI on the Emiratis. The findings envision an “inclusive, people-centered, livable and culturally profound city”, emphasizing the youngster's emotional attachment to visual architectural cultural heritage as an essential for happiness and wellbeing. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Review articles are a means to structure state-of-the-art literature and to organize the growing number of scholarly publications. However, review articles are suffering from numerous limitations, weakening the impact the articles could potentially have. A key limitation is the inability of machines to access and process knowledge presented within review articles. In this work, we present SmartReviews, a review authoring and publishing tool, specifically addressing the limitations of review articles. The tool enables community-based authoring of living articles, leveraging a scholarly knowledge graph to provide machine-actionable knowledge. We evaluate the approach and tool by means of a SmartReview use case. The results indicate that the evaluated article is successfully addressing the weaknesses of the current review practices. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Purpose/Significance] The calculation and deduction that takes the stage of national social development and the scenario of surveying and mapping into consideration is an application of space remote sensing intervening in social science. The proposed map information meta-learning framework model is expected to realize the archival activation and environment topology of remote sensing GIS geographic information data, based upon which the ubiquitous structural description of ancient map semantics could be achieced. As a result, a quantitative calculation basis could be provided for association studies with knowledge graph construction. [Design/Methodology] An integrated knowledge graph of map archives and history books was built to realize geographic transportational location mapping. Description and analysis of geographical classics could help realize the function of integrated retrieval and provide a complex research environment for the composition of geographic classics and spatial location. [Findings/Conclusion] The proposed meta-information framework is able to realize efficient integration of single knowledge objective with broad external knowledge. Finally, it enables the analysis and research of map resources to achieve a leap from map archives to map data, then to map scenarios. [Originality/Value] This study provides a circumscription of semantic division between natural description semantics and image scenarios structural description. Bes ides, it can match suitable adaptive analysis models for different types of map scenarios, which effectively improves the efficiency of knowledge discovery and the robustness of geographic ubiquitous computing process in the field of space humanities. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In recent years, soft service robot(e-SBOT) that can exist in any intelligent terminal have received widespread attention. However, currently the services provided by e-SBOT are extremely limited. This defect mostly dues to two problems, one is that the inaccuracy of capturing user's need caused by incomplete understanding, the other is that the richness, diversity and complexity of service resources make it difficult to select appropriate resources. The existing service resource library is mainly based on the digital world and lacks a unified description and management of service resources both in digital and physical world. In addition, it is mostly useless to recommend service resources that do not match the user's current scenario, resulting in a worse experience. Therefore, it's essential to describe the service resources in combination with the scene and provide the service resources that adapted to the scenario to users in a more accurate and rapid way. To achieve this, we propose a scenario-based service resource description model based on ontology modeling. A multi-view retrieval method is simultaneously developed for rapid retrieval of service resources. Experimental results show that our proposed model and method can improve the retrieval speed and accurately return service resources suitable for user scenarios.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - The Unified Medical Language System, or UMLS, is a repository of medical terminology developed by the U.S. National Library of Medicine for improving the computer system's ability of understanding the biomedical and health languages. The UMLS Metathesaurus is one of the three UMLS knowledge sources, containing medical terms and their relationships. Due to the rapid increase in the number of medical terms recently, the current construction of UMLS Metathesaurus, which heavily depends on lexical tools and human editors, is error-prone and time-consuming. This paper takes advantages of the emerging deep learning models for learning to predict the synonyms and non-synonyms between the pairs of biomedical terms in the Metathesaurus. Our learning approach focuses a subset of specific terms instead of the whole Metathesaurus corpus. Particularly, we train the models with biomedical terms from the Disorders semantic group. To strengthen the models, we enrich the inputs with different strategies, including synonyms and hierarchical relationships from source vocabularies. Our deep learning model adopts the Siamese KG-LSTM (Siamese Knowledge Graph-Long Short-Term Memory) in the architecture. The experimental results show that this approach yields excellent performance when handling the task of synonym detection for Disorders semantic group in the Metathesaurus. This shows the potential of applying machine learning techniques in the UMLS Metathesaurus construction process. Although the work in this paper focuses only on specific semantic group of Disorders, we believe that the proposed method can be applied to other semantic groups in the UMLS Metathesaurus. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Creating access to digital surrogates of primary source materials has spurred the growth of history of science as a field. Enabling and supporting virtual access requires an understanding of the behind-the-scenes requirements of a digitization project. Using McGill's Taylor White Project as a case study, this article reveals how such a project is managed, to result in a unique digital collection that supports research in both the humanities and the sciences. The workflows described transformed a collection of 938 eighteenth-century natural history drawings from a relatively inaccessible archive to a searchable and browsable digital collection, complete with contextualizing interactive visualizations. Understanding this process reveals some of the ways in which digitized data can create new avenues for questioning and examining information. © 2021 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - In the process of translating cultural heritage data into linked open data, in particular from multiple sources, heterogeneity of data is a crucial issue. In this paper, our aim is to demonstrate the interest of linked open data and more precisely the IFLA LRM model for the digital representation of Quebec literature, based on data from various perspectives: authors, publishers, and books. We propose an IFLA LRM knowledge base to represent the aggregated data from these heterogeneous sources. We also extend the IFLA LRM model to take into account important aspects including literary awards, a more detailed description of authors, and book series, as well as interoperability with schema.org. Finally, we evaluate the resulting knowledge base using competency questions obtained from our data providers and show the benefit of data integration. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Scientists always look for the most accurate and relevant answers to their queries in the literature. Traditional scholarly digital libraries list documents in search results, and therefore are unable to provide precise answers to search queries. In other words, search in digital libraries is metadata search and, if available, full-text search. We present a methodology for improving a faceted search system on structured content by leveraging a federation of scholarly knowledge graphs. We implemented the methodology on top of a scholarly knowledge graph. This search system can leverage content from third-party knowledge graphs to improve the exploration of scholarly content. A novelty of our approach is that we use dynamic facets on diverse data types, meaning that facets can change according to the user query. The user can also adjust the granularity of dynamic facets. An additional novelty is that we leverage third-party knowledge graphs to improve exploring scholarly knowledge. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - As more and more knowledge graphs (KG) are published in the Web, there is a need of tools for abstracting their content for their producers to verify their result, and for their consumers to use it. This implies showing the schema-level patterns instantiated in the graph, with the frequency with which they are instantiated. A profile represents this information. In this paper, we propose a new type of profile that we call TT profile, for Types and Terms profile. It shows the used Types and predicates, and also the used Terms because of their paramount importance in most of KGs, especially in the Cultural Heritage (CH) domain. We present an algorithm for building a TT profile from an online KG's assertional part, and we report on experiments performed over a set of CH KGs. Copyright © 2021 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Ontologies or databases describing occupations in terms of competences or skills are an important resource for a number of applications. Exploiting large knowledge graphs thus becomes a promising direction to update those ontologies with entities of the latter, which may be updated faster, especially in the case of crowd-sourced resources. Here we report a first assessment of the potential of that strategy matching knowledge elements in ESCO to Wikidata using NER and document similarity models available at the Spacy NLP libraries. Results show that the approach may be effective, but the use of pre-trained language models and the short texts included with entities (labels and descriptions) does not result in sufficient quality for a fully automated process. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Digital humanities DH aims to solve problems in humanities by using digital ideas and technologies in the fields of computers and the Internet. Nowadays DH has a significant impact on the concepts and models of Library Archival & Information Science LIS. However compared to Library & Information Science Archival Science has neither comprehensively accepted the ideas and technologies from DH nor revealed its value in research paths and methods to DH. In some DH researches archives are only the secondary resources or objects while the results or conclusions of these researches are not related to Archival Science. Thus it is an essential to promote in-depth interaction between DH and Archival Science at the level of research methodology and to mine archives value from the multidimensional perspective. By integrating the concepts and technologies this paper puts forward a two-tiers framework in the paths and methods of archives research on the perspective of DH. First based on theories and practices of archival science the authors analyze the theoretical basis and mapping mechanism of archives research in DH background including some core elements such as philosophy basis research objects service models and etc. Second through reviewing papers and ideas of multi-disciplines a new model of archives research paths has been proposed. We define the archives research paths as the three core primitives called discovering reorganizing and storytelling. Specifically discovering is deconstructed to three sub-primitives containing positioning contexts recognizing and mining in order to discover all the memory entities and their relationships in archives resource without any prejudice. Reorganizing includes static relating and dynamic clustering which are implemented by building knowledge organization models such as Simple Event Ontology SEM and International Council on Archives Records in Contexts Ontology ICA RiC-O as well as adding semantic labels to represent an entity from different perspectives. User detecting framework constructing and archives narrating are fused as storytelling to furthering the distant reading of archives resources. Third correspondingly the authors operate the three primitives to data processing technologies from the perspective of archives value 1 Maintaining the value aiming to transform multi-modal archives to archives data. 2 Mining the value focusing on the dynamic and flexible knowledge organization of archives data. 3 Realizing the value paying attention to the contextual and immersive narrative of archives data. Then this paper selects archives data sets of archivist Wu Baokang as research case to validate the rationality and effectiveness of the paths and methods proposed above and tries to tell some stories about Wu Baokang with different topics. Ultimately we find that the new paths and methods of archives research on the perspective of DH could demonstrate the lofty beliefs and academic qualities of the older generation LIS scholars in New China. In the follow-up research we will focus on the limitations and problems pay attention to the collection and organization of archives with multiple types and sources. We will also set some standards about user participation in archives data description and organization while asking users opinions related to our knowledge discovery and service platform. In conclusion we believe that the paths and methods mentioned above will induce more thinking about the archives resources development and archival science research. Scholars from library & information science and archival science should discover more consistent research methods and interests in DH environment. 11 figs. 2 tabs. 40 refs. © 2021, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

AB  - The ROSSIO Infrastructure aims at aggregating, organising and contextualising digital objects whose metadata descriptions are provided by a consortium of Portuguese academic, public and private sector institutions in the domains of social sciences, arts and humanities. ROSSIO is the Portuguese representative of DARIAH, the European research infrastructure for arts and humanities. A platform is being developed to provide search and content curation services for researchers and the general public, namely digital collections, digital exhibitions and a virtual research environment. The ROSSIO Thesaurus is being developed to support content discovery and management in the platform. The thesaurus is being modelled as a SKOS concept scheme, and it leverages on existing unstructured vocabularies, such as subject headings and thesauri, produced by the ROSSIO data providers. This paper describes the modelling process of the ROSSIO Thesaurus, its integration and role in the infrastructure, its publication as Linked Open Data, and the results of this work after 6 months of development.

AB  - Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) have become an established and recognised practice for guaranteeing good quality ontology engineering. There are several ODP repositories where ODPs are shared as well as ontology design methodologies recommending their reuse. Performing rigorous testing is recommended as well for supporting ontology maintenance and validating the resulting resource against its motivating requirements. Nevertheless, it is less than straightforward to find guidelines on how to apply such methodologies for developing domain-specific knowledge graphs. ArCo is the knowledge graph of Italian Cultural Heritage and has been developed by using eXtreme Design (XD), an ODP- and test-driven methodology. During its development, XD has been adapted to the need of the CH domain e.g. gathering requirements from an open, diverse community of consumers, a new ODP has been defined and many have been specialised to address specific CH requirements. This paper presents ArCo and describes how to apply XD to the development and validation of a CH knowledge graph, also detailing the (intellectual) process implemented for matching the encountered modelling problems to ODPs. Relevant contributions also include a novel web tool for supporting unit-testing of knowledge graphs, a rigorous evaluation of ArCo, and a discussion of methodological lessons learned during ArCo's development.  © 2021 - IOS Press.

AB  - The research of European history across various time layers gives insights about the development of the European cultural identity. Nuremberg as one of the great European metropolises during the Middle Ages experienced a number of transformations throughout the centuries. Within the TRANSRAZ research project, Nuremberg and the development of its architecture and culture is recreated from the 17th to the 21st century. It will be available for researchers and the public by means of an interactive 3D environment. Goal of this poster paper is to discuss the ongoing work of connecting heterogeneous historical data from sources previously hidden in archives to the 3D model using knowledge graphs for a scientifically accurate exploration of Nuremberg. The contribution of this paper is the Nuremberg Address Knowledge Graph (NA-KG) which contains information of people and organizations in Nuremberg from unstructured data of Nuremberg address books. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - A vocabulary of culturally relevant relationships – CRR - between cultural heritage objects in Library, Archive, and Museum (LAM) was proposed with the aim of interlinking digital collections using the Linked Open Data (LOD) technologies. The CRR vocabulary was proposed to be used by culture curators, teachers, historians, etc. to enable them to interlink such digital resources to provide a richer context and to reveal new senses of such resources. This paper aims at testing and evaluating the CRR vocabulary, as follows. Wikipedia articles about remarkable cultural heritage objects as the painting Mona Lisa and the book Dom Casmurro are used to create RDF triples where the heritage object is the subject, relationships of the CRR vocabulary are the predicates, and links found in each Wikipedia article to other LAM digital objects, or other Web resources are the objects of each triple. The RDF graphs thus generated are presented and discussed. The necessity of improvements in the proposed CRR vocabulary is outlined and suggestions of these changes are proposed. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - With the rapid growth of research publications, empowering scientists to keep an oversight over scientific progress is of paramount importance. In this regard, the leaderboards facet of information organization provides an overview on the state-of-the-art by aggregating empirical results from various studies addressing the same research challenge. Crowdsourcing efforts like PapersWithCode among others are devoted to the construction of leaderboards predominantly for various subdomains in Artificial Intelligence. Leaderboards provide machine-readable scholarly knowledge that has proven to be directly useful for scientists to keep track of research progress – their construction could be greatly expedited with automated text mining. This study presents a comprehensive approach for generating leaderboards for knowledge-graph-based scholarly information organization. Specifically, we investigate the problem of automated leaderboard construction using state-of-the-art transformer models, viz. Bert, SciBert, and XLNet. Our analysis reveals an optimal approach that significantly outperforms existing baselines for the task with evaluation scores above 90% in F1. This, in turn, offers new state-of-the-art results for leaderboard extraction.

AB  - The work presented in this paper is engaging with and contributes to the implementation and evaluation of Semantic Web applications in the cultural Linked Open Data (LOD) domain. The main goal is the semantic integration, enrichment and interlinking of data that are generated through the documentation process of artworks and cultural heritage objects. This is accomplished by using state-of-the-art technologies and current standards of the Semantic Web (RDF, OWL, SPARQL), as well as widely accepted models and vocabularies relevant to the cultural domain (Dublin Core, SKOS, Europeana Data Model). A set of specialized tools such as KARMA and OpenRefine/RDF-extension is being used and evaluated in order to achieve the semantic integration of museum data from heterogeneous sources. Interlinking is achieved using tools such as Silk and OpenRefine/RDF-extension, discovering links (at the back-end) between disparate datasets and other external data sources such as DBpedia and Wikidata that enrich the source data. Finally, a front-end Web application is developed in order to exploit the semantically integrated and enriched museum data, and further interlink (and enrich) them (at application run-time), with the data sources of DBpedia and Europeana. The paper discusses engineering choices made for the evaluation of the proposed framework/pipeline. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Culture Heritages are non-renewable and precious resources. How to make the cultural relics collected in museums the heritage displayed on the vast land and characters written in ancient books all come alive is a proposition that all mankind should think and study. The International Image Interoperability Framework IIIF has developed a series of standard API interfaces that aim to ensure the interoperability and accessibility of global image resources storage. Based on the open data five-star model the paper first proposes a five-star model for open images image online high-quality images annotated images open standards and semantic connection. Among them the former three stars focus on the readable characteristics of images and the last two stars focus on availability feature. Subsequently based on the two major technologies of IIIF framework and Artificial Intelligence AI the paper proposes a technical framework for the deep application of image resources in cultural heritage. In the framework the IIIF part is mainly responsible for the organization and presentation of image resources through the four published API interface standards while the AI technologies can be used to realize the recognition and comprehension of image contents. Specifically the IIIF Image API specifies a web service that returns an image in response to a standard HTTP or HTTPS request. The IIIF Presentation API is to provide the information necessary to allow a rich online viewing environment. The IIIF Search API lays out the interoperability mechanism for searching annotation content within a single IIIF resource. And the IIIF Authentication API describes a set of workflows for guiding the user through an existing access control system. In AI implementation part digitalization mainly realizes the reorganization of different image resources. Different technologies need to be adopted according to the type of image text image and non-text image in textualization. Conceptualization is to identify and extract entities from textual content. Through semantic connection the semantic annotation knowledge association and content enhancement of image resources can be realized. From the perspective of application smart application explores the realization of semantic services and in-depth application of images through knowledge graphs. In the case part the paper uses semantic technologies such as IIIF linked data graph database and ontology to build IIIF-IIP system an immersion-style interactive platform which includes the process of publishing annotation linking and reuse of image resources. And this platform supports the online interaction of ultra-high definition and super-giant image resources with billions of pixels and explores an ecological way that allows cultural heritage to release connect and live. At the end the paper takes part of the flower-related collection resources of Vincent Van Gogh’s works published by different collection institutions as an example to verify the feasibility of the implementation plan and technical path of the paper which will play a good guidance and reference for the dissemination and research of traditional cultures. Although the IIIF framework is still being improved it does not affect the technology that has become a hot spot pursued by cultural heritage institutions. The combination of IIIF and AI will usher in a new era of digital humanities research and jointly help the effective protection inheritance and research of image resources in cultural heritage. 10 figs. 1 tab. 24 refs. © 2021, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

AB  - Augmenting human teacher’s perceptual and reasoning capability by leveraging machine intelligence, in monitoring the multiple mental states of students exposed in discussion activities, inferring the need for latent assistance, has been on the agenda of educational community. The development of modern sensing technologies makes it possible to generate and accumulate massive amounts of multimodal data, which offers opportunities for supporting novel methodological approaches that automatically measure the mental states of students from various perspectives during a multi-participant discussion activity where the dynamic and time-sensitive decision-making plays a major role. In this chapter, an advanced multi-sensor-based data collection system is introduced which is applied in a real university research lab to record and archive a multimodal “in-the-wild” teacher-student conversation-based discussion dataset for a long term. A line of data-driven analysis works is performed to explore how we could transform the raw sensing signals into context-relevant information to improve decision-making. In addition, how to design multimodal analytics to augment the ability to recognize different mental states and the possibility of taking advantages of the supplement and replacement capabilities between different modalities to provide human teachers with solutions for addressing the challenges with monitoring students in different real-world education environments is also presented. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.

AB  - This paper discusses the digital method Social Meaning Mapping (SMM) and its affordances to capture aspects of the museum visit. SMM, embedded in the Visitracker tablet-app, enables the annotation of visitors’ movement and interactions in a particular gallery room post-visit. During a researcher-led session, visitors handle the tablet and annotate their experience on its screen while sharing their thoughts aloud. Both visitors’ annotations and their voices are being recorded through the app. Each SMM can be accessed through Visitracker’s portal as a video which re-creates visitors’ ‘trails of walking’ (what they mark) and their ‘ways of talking’ (what they say) in synchronization. In this paper, we draw upon data collected at the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in Vienna to argue that SMM created by visitors can complement tracking and timing (T&T) data collected by researchers, allowing for a more holistic understanding of the museum experience. The analysis shows that SMM captures visitors’ experiences in a multimodal way, both visual and verbal, enabling them to foreground aspects of their personal experience, spatial practices, co-experience and social realms of their visit. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Information and Knowledge Organisation explores the role of knowledge organisation in the digital humanities. By focusing on how information is described, represented and organised in both research and practice, this work furthers the transdisciplinary nature of digital humanities. Including contributions from Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and the Middle East, the volume explores the potential uses of, and challenges involved in, applying the organisation of information and knowledge in the various areas of Digital Humanities. With a particular focus on the digital worlds of cultural heritage collections, the book also includes chapters that focus on machine learning, knowledge graphs, text analysis, text annotations and network analysis. Other topics covered include: semantic technologies, conceptual schemas and data augmentation, digital scholarly editing, metadata creation, browsing, visualisation and relevance ranking. Most importantly, perhaps, the book provides a starting point for discussions about the impact of information and knowledge organisation and related tools on the methodologies used in the Digital Humanities field. Information and Knowledge Organisation is intended for use by researchers, students and professionals interested in the role information and knowledge organisation plays in the Digital Humanities. It will be essential reading for those working in library and information science, computer science and across the humanities. © 2022 Koraljka Golub and Ying-Hsang Liu.

AB  - We describe an annotation initiative to capture the scholarly contributions in natural language processing (NLP) articles, particularly, for the articles that discuss machine learning (ML) approaches for various information extraction tasks. We develop the annotation task based on a pilot annotation exercise on 50 NLP-ML scholarly articles presenting contributions to five information extraction tasks 1. machine translation, 2. named entity recognition, 3. question answering, 4. relation classification, and 5. text classification. In this article, we describe the outcomes of this pilot annotation phase. Through the exercise we have obtained an annotation methodology; and found ten core information units that reflect the contribution of the NLP-ML scholarly investigations. The resulting annotation scheme we developed based on these information units is called NLPContributions. The overarching goal of our endeavor is four-fold: 1) to find a systematic set of patterns of subject-predicate-object statements for the semantic structuring of scholarly contributions that are more or less generically applicable for NLP-ML research articles; 2) to apply the discovered patterns in the creation of a larger annotated dataset for training machine readers [18] of research contributions; 3) to ingest the dataset into the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) infrastructure as a showcase for creating user-friendly state-of-the-art overviews; 4) to integrate the machine readers into the ORKG to assist users in the manual curation of their respective article contributions. We envision that the NLPContributions methodology engenders a wider discussion on the topic toward its further refinement and development. © 2020 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Reviewing scientific literature is a cumbersome, time consuming but crucial activity in research. Leveraging a scholarly knowledge graph, we present a methodology and a system for comparing scholarly literature, in particular research contributions describing the addressed problem, utilized materials, employed methods and yielded results. The system can be used by researchers to quickly get familiar with existing work in a specific research domain (e.g., a concrete research question or hypothesis). Additionally, it can be used to publish literature surveys following the FAIR Data Principles. The methodology to create a research contribution comparison consists of multiple tasks, specifically: (a) finding similar contributions, (b) aligning contribution descriptions, (c) visualizing and finally (d) publishing the comparison. The methodology is implemented within the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), a scholarly infrastructure that enables researchers to collaboratively describe, find and compare research contributions. We evaluate the implementation using data extracted from published review articles. The evaluation also addresses the FAIRness of comparisons published with the ORKG. © 2020. ACM ISBN.

AB  - Reflectance transformation imaging (RTI) is a computational photography technique widely used in the cultural heritage and material science domains to characterize relieved surfaces. It basically consists of capturing multiple images from a fixed viewpoint with varying lights. Handling the potentially huge amount of information stored in an RTI acquisition that consists typically of 50–100 RGB values per pixel, allowing data exchange, interactive visualization, and material analysis, is not easy. The solution used in practical applications consists of creating “relightable images” by approximating the pixel information with a function of the light direction, encoded with a small number of parameters. This encoding allows the estimation of images relighted from novel, arbitrary lights, with a quality that, however, is not always satisfactory. In this paper, we present NeuralRTI, a framework for pixel-based encoding and relighting of RTI data. Using a simple autoencoder architecture, we show that it is possible to obtain a highly compressed representation that better preserves the original information and provides increased quality of virtual images relighted from novel directions, especially in the case of challenging glossy materials. We also address the problem of validating the relight quality on different surfaces, proposing a specific benchmark, SynthRTI, including image collections synthetically created with physical-based rendering and featuring objects with different materials and geometric complexity. On this dataset and as well on a collection of real acquisitions performed on heterogeneous surfaces, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed relightable image encoding. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Expanding a set of known domain experts with new individuals, that have similar expertise, is a problem with many practical applications (e.g., adding new members to a conference program committee). In this work, we study this problem in the context of academic experts and we introduce VeTo, a novel method to effectively deal with it by exploiting scholarly knowledge graphs. In particular, VeTo expands the given set of experts by identifying researchers that share similar publishing habits with them, based on a graph analysis approach. Our experiments show that VeTo is more effective than existing techniques that can be applied to deal with the same problem. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Although iDocs are a newer genre of non-fiction IDNs, there are few studies reporting results on their impact and the user experience. A common goal of iDocs is to engage the pubic in social, economic and environmental issues. This investigation applied the iDoc genre to cultural heritage to create a prototype for user testing titled Sentenced to Transportation: A Virtual Tour of Australia’s Convict Past. The user testing completed in this study analysed three key variables: the level of perceived agency based on the narrative structure, choices provided in the interface design, and ability to persuade further user participation. The results show that users can be persuaded through the narrative design to proceed non-linearly and to engage in further user participation post-interaction. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become the preferred technology for representing, sharing and adding knowledge to modern AI applications. While KGs have become a mainstream technology, the RDF/SPARQL-centric toolset for operating with them at scale is heterogeneous, difficult to integrate and only covers a subset of the operations that are commonly needed in data science applications. In this paper we present KGTK, a data science-centric toolkit designed to represent, create, transform, enhance and analyze KGs. KGTK represents graphs in tables and leverages popular libraries developed for data science applications, enabling a wide audience of developers to easily construct knowledge graph pipelines for their applications. We illustrate the framework with real-world scenarios where we have used KGTK to integrate and manipulate large KGs, such as Wikidata, DBpedia and ConceptNet. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - We consider the discovery of future research collaborations as a link prediction problem applied on scientific knowledge graphs. Our approach integrates into a single knowledge graph both structured and unstructured textual data through a novel representation of multiple scientific documents. The Neo4j graph database is used for the representation of the proposed scientific knowledge graph. For the implementation of our approach, we use the Python programming language and the scikit-learn ML library. We benchmark our approach against classical link prediction algorithms using accuracy, recall, and precision as our performance metrics. Our initial experimentations demonstrate a significant improvement of the accuracy of the future collaboration prediction task. The experimentations reported in this paper use the new COVID-19 Open Research Dataset. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Project In Codice Ratio is developing tools to extract the knowledge contained in the ancient manuscripts of the Vatican Archives. The scarcity of datasets suitable for our setting has led us to rely on crowdsourcing in all phases of our project. In this paper we discuss our approaches for leveraging inexpensive non-expert workers to fruitfully perform labelling operations on challenging manuscripts. We describe the range of different tasks we are devising, as well as the corresponding priority and redundancy policies we are employing. We describe the datasets collected thus far and the corresponding results.  Copyright © 2020 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Knowledge management plays a crucial role in initiatives that promotes the discovery and sharing of cultural and heritage informational resources from diverse and autonomous organizations and initiatives. Information in this domain is heterogeneous, distributed, multi-lingual, comes in unstructured formats and large quantities, is strongly contextualized by time and place is created collaboratively. These challenges can be undertaken using semantic technologies. Semantic Web approach and Linked Data technologies are a catalyst for cross-domain and cross-organizational semantic data interoperability and data integration. In this regard, this work will look at the interaction between knowledge management and linked open data within the context of cultural and heritage data with a particular focus on the concept of music data. This work will discuss, among other things, how Semantic Knowledge Graphs based on linked data can contribute to enhancing knowledge management and increase productivity, in actions related with cultural data enrichment, data exploration, knowledge discovery, cultural data reuse, and data visualization. By representing information using data models and open semantic standards, data integration and reasoning can be applied to the cultural data in a well-defined way. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - With the rapid growth of research publications, there is a vast amount of scholarly knowledge that needs to be organized in digital libraries. To deal with this challenge, techniques relying on knowledge-graph structures are being advocated. Within such graph-based pipelines, inferring relation types between related scientific concepts is a crucial step. Recently, advanced techniques relying on language models pre-trained on large corpora have been popularly explored for automatic relation classification. Despite the remarkable contributions that have been made, many of these methods were evaluated under different scenarios, which limits their comparability. To address this shortcoming, we present a thorough empirical evaluation of eight Bert-based classification models by focusing on two key factors: 1) Bert model variants, and 2) classification strategies. Experiments on three corpora show that domain-specific pre-training corpus benefits the Bert-based classification model to identify the type of scientific relations. Although the strategy of predicting a single relation each time achieves a higher classification accuracy than the strategy of identifying multiple relation types simultaneously in general, the latter strategy demonstrates a more consistent performance in the corpus with either a large or small number of annotations. Our study aims to offer recommendations to the stakeholders of digital libraries for selecting the appropriate technique to build knowledge-graph-based systems for enhanced scholarly information organization. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Open Science Graphs (OSGs) are Scientific Knowledge Graphs whose intent is to improve the overall FAIRness of science, by enabling open access to graph representations of metadata about people, artefacts, institutions involved in the research lifecycle, as well as the relationships between these entities, in order to support stakeholder needs, such as discovery, reuse, reproducibility, statistics, trends, monitoring, impact, validation, and assessment. The represented information may span across entities such as research artefacts (e.g. publications, data, software, samples, instruments) and items of their content (e.g. statistical hypothesis tests reported in publications), research organisations, researchers, services, projects, and funders. OSGs include relationships between such entities and sometimes formalised (semantic) concepts characterising them, such as machine-readable concept descriptions for advanced discoverability, interoperability, and reuse. OSGs are generally valuable individually, but would greatly benefit from information exchange across their collections, thereby improving their efficacy to serve stakeholder needs. They could, therefore, reuse and exploit the data aggregation and added value that characterise each OSG, decentralising the effort and capitalising on synergies, as no one-size-fits-all solution exists. The RDA IG on Open Science Graphs for FAIR Data is investigating the motivation and challenges underpinning the realisation of an Interoperability Framework for OSGs. This work describes the key motivations for i) the definition of a classification for OSGs to compare their features, identify commonalities and differences, and added value and for ii) the definition of an Interoperability Framework, specifically an information model and APIs that enable a seamless exchange of information across graphs. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce the MLM (Multiple Languages and Modalities) dataset - a new resource to train and evaluate multitask systems on samples in multiple modalities and three languages. The generation process and inclusion of semantic data provide a resource that further tests the ability for multitask systems to learn relationships between entities. The dataset is designed for researchers and developers who build applications that perform multiple tasks on data encountered on the web and in digital archives. A second version of MLM provides a geo-representative subset of the data with weighted samples for countries of the European Union. We demonstrate the value of the resource in developing novel applications in the digital humanities with a motivating use case and specify a benchmark set of tasks to retrieve modalities and locate entities in the dataset. Evaluation of baseline multitask and single task systems on the full and geo-representative versions of MLM demonstrate the challenges of generalising on diverse data. In addition to the digital humanities, we expect the resource to contribute to research in multimodal representation learning, location estimation, and scene understanding. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Concepts of neighbors define a symbolic similarity between the entities of a knowledge graph. Starting with an entity, each concept of neighbors is a cluster of neighbor entities that share a common graph pattern centered on the entity. In this demo paper, we recall the definitions of concepts of neighbors, and we present a Jena library extension whose API enables to compute concepts of neighbors for an RDF(S) Jena model. We also present a graphical interface that enables a user to perform those computations in a simple and interactive way. © 2020 Extraction et Gestion des Connaissances, EGC 2020. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate what metadata elements for access points currently exist to represent diverse library reading materials, either in libraries or from external sources, as well as what metadata elements for access points are currently not present but are necessary to represent diverse library reading materials. Design/methodology/approach: A field scan of thirteen contemporary metadata schemas identified elements that might serve as potential access points regarding the diversity status of resource creators as well as topical or thematic content. Elements were semantically mapped using a metadata crosswalk to understand the intellectual and conceptual space of the elements. Element definitions and application of controlled vocabularies were also examined where possible to offer an additional context. Findings: Metadata elements describing gender, occupation, geographic region, audience and age currently exist in many schemas and could potentially be used to offer access to diverse library materials. However, metadata elements necessary to represent racial, ethnic, national and cultural identity are currently not present in specific forms necessary for enabling resource access and collection assessment. The lack of distinct elements contributes to the implicit erasure of marginalized identities. Originality/value: The search for metadata describing diversity is a first step toward enabling more systematic access to diverse library materials. The need for systematic description of diversity to make visible and promote diverse materials is highlighted in this paper. Though the subject of this paper is library organization systems and, for clarity, uses terms specific to the library profession, the issues present are relevant to all information professionals and knowledge organization systems. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Digital Humanities is not only the innovation of the research paradigm of humanities research but also means a brand-new mode of knowledge production and knowledge communication. Therefore, there comes a trend that it needs to combine researchers and research institutions in various fields, as well as the cultural memory institutions such as Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums (GLAM) to build Digital Humanities infrastructure to support new research paradigm, knowledge production and knowledge communication. This paper aims to explore how to build Digital Humanities infrastructure, clarify the roles, tasks and contributions of various responsible subjects, especially GLAM institutions, so as to help libraries to identify the role, orientation, advantages and become an indispensable organic unit in the whole Digital Humanities infrastructure. By using the methods of literature research, requirements analysis, case study and practical verification, the concept “Data Infrastructure” is separated from “Research Infrastructure” and defined. It is considered that the “Data Infrastructure” of Digital Humanities is based on the “data”, which fully embodies the characteristics of large scale, long time coverage, wide geographical scope, small description granularity and multiple dimensions of “data”. It is an open, public and sustainable “middle-end” data platform which is independent of specific application development and research in specific fields and between the “background” of information infrastructure and the “front-end” of research in specific fields. Based on the investigation of the current situation of theoretical research and practical application of infrastructure in the fields of humanities and GLAM, this paper analyzes the general functional requirements and technical specifications of “Data Infrastructure” for Digital Humanities research, including four aspects: cross institutional co-construction and sharing, cross network open access, cross domain knowledge consilience, and cross space-time version iteration. Taking the Digital Humanities practice of Shanghai Library as an example, this paper demonstrates that the combination of Bibliographic Control, Authority Control, Knowledge Organization, Evidence-based practise methods and Linked Data, Knowledge Graph, and Big Data technology is expected to provide some methodological contribution to the construction of “Data Infrastructure”. At the same time, that the GLAM institutions have accumulated massive, structured and standardized open data and resource integration experience lays the foundation for the construction of “Data Infrastructure”. Finally, the following conclusions are drawn: the specific research work should be handed over to the humanities researchers. GLAM institutions are committed to strengthening the application of new technologies, promoting data openness, interconnection and knowledge consilience, building a public, open and sustainable “Data Infrastructure”, and providing new research paradigm, knowledge production and knowledge communication to support humanities research. Those are what GLAM institutions should and can do in the Digital Humanities tide. However, this paper puts forward the concept, definition, general functional requirements and technical specifications of “Data Infrastructure”, the demonstrated contribution of library methodology, and the role of institutions in the construction of Digital Humanities Data Infrastructure, which need to be discussed in depth with more GLAM practitioners and researchers in specific fields and further tested during the practice in the future. 2 figs. 28 refs. © 2020, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

AB  - Our work seeks to overcome data quality issues related to incomplete author affiliation data in bibliographic records in order to support accurate and reliable measurement of international research collaboration (IRC). We propose, implement, and evaluate a method that leverages the Web-based knowledge graph Wikidata to resolve publication affiliation data to particular countries. The method is tested with general and domain-specific data sets. Our evaluation covers the magnitude of improvement, accuracy, and consistency. Results suggest the method is beneficial, reliable, and consistent, and thus a viable and improved approach to measuring IRC. Though our evaluation suggests the method works with both general and domain-specific bibliographic data sets, it may perform differently with data sets not tested here. Further limitations stem from the use of the R programming language and R libraries for country identification as well as imbalanced data coverage and quality in Wikidata that may also change over time. The new method helps to increase the accuracy in IRC studies and provides a basis for further development into a general tool that enriches bibliographic data using the Wikidata knowledge graph. This is the first attempt to enrich bibliographic data using a peer-produced, Web-based knowledge graph like Wikidata.  © 2020 2020 Ba Xuan Nguyen et al., published by Sciendo.

AB  - The existence of numerous and rich traditional music collections, their importance for preserving cultural heritage and an increasing interest in this type of music were the key factors leading to the concept of a music research support environment for ethnomusicologists. Our experience with Polish traditional music collections and archives shows that their existence is not equivalent to their availability for search, retrieval, processing and analysis. The idea behind the environment is to provide stable infrastructure and software solutions necessary to enable musicological research and, in a wider perspective, to open traditional music resources for a larger group of users. The paper describes our motivation for building such music research support environment and a number of issues and challenges we have encountered in the process. We present the environment concept, building stages already completed and plans for its further development. The environment is founded on the dLibra digital library adapted to the requirements of traditional music content and collections and with consideration for the current needs of ethnomusicologists. It combines the advantages of a user-centric layered digital library and Linked Open Data enrichment with system-centric music processing tools. A few of such tools have already been developed, for example, to support automatic music transcription of a large number of recordings in order to make them available for research and analysis. Future development plans include content aggregation and content-based indexing and search. © 2020. ACM ISBN.

AB  - Objective: With using natural language processing (NLP) technology to analyze and process the text of 'Treatise on Febrile Diseases (TFDs)' for the sake of finding important information, this paper attempts to apply NLP in the field of text mining of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) literature. Materials and Methods: Based on the Python language, the experiment invoked the NLP toolkit such as Jieba, nltk, gensim, and sklearn library, and combined with Excel and Word software. The text of 'TFDs' was sequentially cleaned, segmented, and moved the stopped words, and then implementing word frequency statistics and analysis, keyword extraction, named entity recognition (NER) and other operations, finally calculating text similarity. Results: Jieba can accurately identify the herbal name in 'TFDs.' Word frequency statistics based on the word segmentation found that 'warm therapy' is an important treatment of 'TFDs.' Guizhi decoction is the main prescription, and five core decoctions are identified. Keyword extraction based on the term 'frequency-inverse document frequency' algorithm is ideal. The accuracy of NER in 'TFDs' is about 86%; latent semantic indexing model calculating the similarity, 'Understanding of Synopsis of Golden Chamber (SGC)' is much more similar with 'SGC' than with 'TFDs.' The results meet expectation. Conclusions: It lays a research foundation for applying NLP to the field of text mining of unstructured TCM literature. With the combination of deep learning technology, NLP as an important branch of artificial intelligence will have broader application prospective in the field of text mining in TCM literature and construction of TCM knowledge graph as well as TCM knowledge services. © 2020 Medknow.

AB  - New technologies for storing and handling knowledge provide unprecedented opportunities for enhanced fruition of digital libraries and archives. Going beyond document retrieval based on lexical content or metadata, using the context of documents, and/or of their content, may provide very new ways to put them in perspective and grasp a deeper understanding thereof, also for non-technical users. Several components are needed to support this new perspective: suitable ontological resources to describe such variated knowledge, collaborative tools to collect the precious knowledge scattered across many scholars and practitioners spread all over the world, and to store it in a knowledge base, fruition tools to make the collected knowledge available to all interested stakeholders (scholars, researchers, but also common people). This paper proposes the GraphBRAIN environment as a possible infrastructure. It is a general-purpose tool that allows its users to design and populate knowledge graphs, to collaboratively enrich them, and to exploit advanced fruition tools, consultation and analysis tools. Its functionality may also be provided as a set of Web services to end-user applications. An initial version of the ontology and knowledge graph for digital libraries and archives are also presented and discussed in the paper. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - With the prevalence of smart terminal devices and the rapid development of the mobile Internet, mobile application markets become increasingly prosperous. Third-party libraries have played an essential role in mobile application development. These libraries can shorten development time, increase development efficiency, and improve development quality. Currently, a large number of third-party libraries have been published, which puts a heavy burden on developers in selecting appropriate libraries. Towards this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel third-party library recommendation approach by integrating topic modeling and knowledge graph techniques. In the topic modeling component, we extract topics from textual application descriptions and make recommendations based on libraries used by applications that share similar topics with the new application to develop. In the knowledge graph component, we leverage knowledge graph to incorporate structured information of third-party libraries and applications, as well as the interaction information of applications and libraries for the recommendation. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset show that our proposed approach outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in terms of recommendation performance. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Modeling visitor engagement is a key challenge in informal learning environments, such as museums and science centers. Devising predictive models of visitor engagement that accurately forecast salient features of visitor behavior, such as dwell time, holds significant potential for enabling adaptive learning environments and visitor analytics for museums and science centers. In this paper, we introduce a multimodal early prediction approach to modeling visitor engagement with interactive science museum exhibits. We utilize multimodal sensor data including eye gaze, facial expression, posture, and interaction log data captured during visitor interactions with an interactive museum exhibit for environmental science education, to induce predictive models of visitor dwell time. We investigate machine learning techniques (random forest, support vector machine, Lasso regression, gradient boosting trees, and multi-layer perceptron) to induce multimodal predictive models of visitor engagement with data from 85 museum visitors. Results from a series of ablation experiments suggest that incorporating additional modalities into predictive models of visitor engagement improves model accuracy. In addition, the models show improved predictive performance over time, demonstrating that increasingly accurate predictions of visitor dwell time can be achieved as more evidence becomes available from visitor interactions with interactive science museum exhibits. These findings highlight the efficacy of multimodal data for modeling museum exhibit visitor engagement.  © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Cultural heritage in Quebec is often represented as collections of French documents that contain a lot of valuable, yet unstructured, data. One of the current aims of the Quebec Ministry of Culture and Communications (MCCQ) is to learn a knowledge graph from unstructured documents to offer an integrated semantic portal on Quebec’s cultural heritage. In the context of this project, we describe a machine learning and open information extraction approach that leverages named entity extraction and open relation extraction in English to extract a knowledge graph from French documents. We also enhance the generic entities that can be recognized in texts with domain-related types. Our results show that our method leads to a substantial enrichment of the knowledge graph based on the initial corpus provided by the MCCQ. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to describe insights gained from a collaboration project between RISE, an experimental research institute, and Borås Museum, a local cultural heritage institution, around the topic of how technology can be used in museums to encourage social interaction between visitors and between visitors and the museum staff. This is investigated through a case study of “Anyone Can Innovate!”, a multi-participatory game-like VR-installation, using a perspective of participatory design. The study was conducted through observations by the developers, formal user testing with externally recruited testers, and by an interview with the responsible project leader and curator from Borås Museum. The VR-installation was tested in two iterations with different levels of embedded guidance, and included different roles for the participants, as an attempt to boost collaboration and interaction. One conclusion of the study is that the use of technology in a museum doesn't per se mean that it will be participatory, and that it does not necessarily exclude the role of a human guide. In the discussion part, examples are given on how technology can be used as a tool to use participatory design. © 2021 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - There is currently a gap between the natural language expression of scholarly publications and their structured semantic content modeling to enable intelligent content search. With the volume of research growing exponentially every year, a search feature operating over semantically structured content is compelling. Toward this end, in this work, we propose a novel semantic data model for modeling the contribution of scientific investigations. Our model, i.e. the Research Contribution Model (RCM), includes a schema of pertinent concepts highlighting six core information units, viz. Objective, Method, Activity, Agent, Material, and Result, on which the contribution hinges. It comprises bottom-up design considerations made from three scientific domains, viz. Medicine, Computer Science, and Agriculture, which we highlight as case studies. For its implementation in a knowledge graph application we introduce the idea of building blocks called Knowledge Graph Cells (KGC), which provide the following characteristics: (1) they limit the expressibility of ontologies to what is relevant in a knowledge graph regarding specific concepts on the theme of research contributions; (2) they are expressible via ABox and TBox expressions; (3) they enforce a certain level of data consistency by ensuring that a uniform modeling scheme is followed through rules and input controls; (4) they organize the knowledge graph into named graphs; (5) they provide information for the front end for displaying the knowledge graph in a human-readable form such as HTML pages; and (6) they can be seamlessly integrated into any existing publishing process that supports form-based input abstracting its semantic technicalities including RDF semantification from the user. Thus RCM joins the trend of existing work toward enhanced digitalization of scholarly publication enabled by an RDF semantification as a knowledge graph fostering the evolution of the scholarly publications beyond written text. © 2020.

AB  - Scientific data publications may include interactive data applications designed by scientists to explore a scientific problem. Defined as knowledge systems, their development is complex when data are aggregated from multiple sources over time. Multimodal data are created, encoded, and maintained differently, and even when reporting about identical phenomena, fields and their values may be inconsistent across datasets. To assure the validity and accuracy of the application, the data has to abide by curation requirements similar to those ruling digital libraries. We present a novel, inquirydriven curation approach aimed to optimize multimodal datasets curation and maximize data reuse by domain researchers. We demonstrate the method through the ASTRIAGraph project, in which multiple data sources about near earth space objects are aggregated into a central knowledge system. The process involves multidisciplinary collaboration, resulting in the design of a data model as the backbone for both data curation and scientific inquiry. We demonstrate a) how data provenance information is needed to assess the uncertainty of the results of scientific inquiries involving multiple data sources, and b) that continuous curation of integrated datasets is facilitated when undertaken as integral to the research project. The approach provides flexibility to support expansion of scientific inquiries and data in the knowledge system, and allows for transparent and explainable results. © 2020. ACM ISBN.

AB  - Objective. A promising application of BCI technology is in the development of personalized therapies that can target neural circuits linked to mental or physical disabilities. Typical BCIs, however, offer limited value due to simplistic designs and poor understanding of the conditions being treated. Building BCIs on more solid grounds may require the characterization of the brain dynamics supporting cognition and behavior at multiple scales, from single-cell and local field potential (LFP) recordings in animals to non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) in humans. Despite recent efforts, a unifying software framework to support closed-loop studies in both animals and humans is still lacking. The objective of this paper is to develop such a unifying neurotechnological software framework. Approach. Here we develop the Simulink for Brain Signal Interfaces library (SimBSI). Simulink is a mature graphical programming environment within MATLAB that has gained traction for processing electrophysiological data. SimBSI adds to this ecosystem: 1) advanced human EEG source imaging, 2) cross-species multimodal data acquisition based on the Lab Streaming Layer library, and 3) a graphical experimental design platform. Main results. We use several examples to demonstrate the capabilities of the library, ranging from simple signal processing, to online EEG source imaging, cognitive task design, and closed-loop neuromodulation. We further demonstrate the simplicity of developing a sophisticated experimental environment for rodents within this environment. Significance. With the SimBSI library we hope to aid BCI practitioners of dissimilar backgrounds in the development of, much needed, single and cross-species closed-loop neuroscientific experiments. These experiments may provide the necessary mechanistic data for BCIs to become effective therapeutic tools. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Due to the lack of structure, scholarly knowledge remains hardly accessible for machines. Scholarly knowledge graphs have been proposed as a solution. Creating such a knowledge graph requires manual effort and domain experts, and is therefore time-consuming and cumbersome. In this work, we present a human-in-the-loop methodology used to build a scholarly knowledge graph leveraging literature survey articles. Survey articles often contain manually curated and high-quality tabular information that summarizes findings published in the scientific literature. Consequently, survey articles are an excellent resource for generating a scholarly knowledge graph. The presented methodology consists of five steps, in which tables and references are extracted from PDF articles, tables are formatted and finally ingested into the knowledge graph. To evaluate the methodology, 92 survey articles, containing 160 survey tables, have been imported in the graph. In total, 2626 papers have been added to the knowledge graph using the presented methodology. The results demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, but also indicate that manual effort is required and thus underscore the important role of human experts. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Historical theatre collections are an important form of cultural heritage and need to be preserved and made accessible to users. Often however, the metadata available for a historical collection are too sparse to create meaningful exploration tools. On the use case of a historical theatre photograph collection, this position paper discusses means of automated recognition of historical images to enhance the variety and depth of the metadata associated to the collection. Moreover, it describes how the results obtained by image recognition can be integrated into an existing Knowledge Graph (KG) and how these generated structured image metadata can support data exploration and automated querying to support human users. The goal of the paper is to explore cultural heritage data curation techniques based on deep learning and KGs to make the data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable in accordance with the F.A.I.R principles.

AB  - Classical Chinese poetry is a precious cultural heritage. It is significant to use the rich information in classical Chinese poetry to further investigate the language, literature and historical development of Chinese culture. However, the knowledge of classical Chinese poetry is highly fragmented. It not only exists in poetry itself, but also is widely distributed in the materials which are used to explain poetry, such as annotations, translations, appreciations, etc. Our aim is to obtain the potential semantic relationship between words and expressions, and use knowledge graph to link them. By doing this, we could integrate fragmented knowledge in a systematic way, which enables us to achieve better reasoning and analysis of classical Chinese poetry knowledge. In this paper, we propose a method to construct classical Chinese poetry knowledge graph (CCP-KG). About building nodes of CCP-KG, we use the improved Apriori algorithm to generate candidate words, then check if the candidate word appears in the annotations to determine when it can be a node of CCP-KG. About building edges of CCP-KG, the semantic relationship between words is established through the annotations, then we use the artificially constructed classical Chinese poetry hierarchical structure to establish the relationship between abstract semantics. Finally, we obtain CCP-KG, which covers every aspect of classical Chinese poetry and contains multi-layer semantic links between words. Taking Tang poetry as an example, CCP-KG can be used to analysis classical Chinese poems in different dimensions. Compared with character-based data analysis, the use of CCP-KG assists literary research more in-depth from the perspective of semantics. Therefore, CCP-KG is necessary in analyzing classical Chinese poems. In addition, CCP-KG can also be applied to various tasks like reasoning and analysis in classical Chinese poetry. We conduct experiments on the tasks of determining the theme of poetry and analyzing the emotion of poetry respectively, showing the effectiveness and application value of our constructed CCP-KG. © 2020, Science Press.

AB  - In the biotechnology and biomedical domains, recent text mining efforts advocate for machine-interpretable, and preferably, semantified, documentation formats of laboratory processes. This includes wet-lab protocols, (in)organic materials synthesis reactions, genetic manipulations and procedures for faster computer-mediated analysis and predictions. Herein, we present our work on the representation of semantified bioassays in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG). In particular, we describe a semantification system work-in-progress to generate, automatically and quickly, the critical semantified bioassay data mass needed to foster a consistent user audience to adopt the ORKG for recording their bioassays and facilitate the organisation of research, according to FAIR principles. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Through a design study, we develop an approach to data exploration that utilizes elastic visualizations designed to support varying degrees of detail and abstraction. Examining the notions of scalability and elasticity in interactive visualizations, we introduce a visualization of personal reading traces such as marginalia or markings inside the reference library of German realist author Theodor Fontane. To explore such a rich and extensive collection, meaningful visual forms of abstraction and detail are as important as the transitions between those states. Following a growing research interest in the role of fluid interactivity and animations between views, we are particularly interested in the potential of carefully designed transitions and consistent representations across scales. The resulting prototype addresses humanistic research questions about the interplay of distant and close reading with visualization research on continuous navigation along several granularity levels, using scrolling as one of the main interaction mechanisms. In addition to presenting the design process and resulting prototype, we present findings from a qualitative evaluation of the tool, which suggest that bridging between distant and close views can enhance exploration, but that transitions between views need to be crafted very carefully to facilitate comprehension. © 2020 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum © 2020 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - We present the design and implementation of an AR application that connects museum objects to their original locations in archaeological sites; our aim is both to solve the museum de-contextualization problem and to promote exploration of the archaeological sites in a region. The application projects the museum object upon the archaeological site and its original location, bringing the landscape into the museum experience. We outline technical challenges encountered and solutions adopted. Since this is a work in progress, further user testing remains to evaluate our approach and the app. © Copyright 2020 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - This paper presents the vision and longstanding work in Finland on creating a national Cultural Heritage ontology infrastructure and semantic portals based on Linked Data on the Semantic Web. In particular, the “Sampo” series of semantic portals is considered, including CultureSampo (2009), TravelSampo (2011), BookSampo (2011), WarSampo (2015), BiographySampo (2018), NameSampo (2019), WarWictimSampo (2019), FindSampo (2019), MMM (2020), LawSampo (2020), AcademySampo (2020), and ParliamentSampo (2022). They all share the “Sampo model” for publishing Cultural Heritage content the Semantic Web that typically involves three components: 1) A “business model” for harmonizing, aggregating, and publishing heterogeneous, distributed contents based on a shared ontology infrastructure. 2) An approach to interface design, where the data can be re-used and accessed independently from multiple application perspectives, while the data resides in a single SPARQL endpoint. 3) A two-step model for accessing and analyzing the data where the focus of interest is first filtered o ut u sing f aceted s emantic s earch, a nd t hen v isualized o r a nalyzed by ready-to-use Digital Humanities tools of the portal. This model has been proven useful in practise: Sampo portals have attracted lots users from tens of thousands to millions depending on the Sampo. It is argued that the next step ahead could be portals for serendipitous knowledge discovery where the tools, based on AI techniques, are able to find automatically serendipitous, “interesting” phenomena and research questions in the data, and even solve problems with explanations.

AB  - The analysis of Cultural Heritage (CH) artefacts is an important task in the Digital Humanities. Increasingly, rich CH artefact data comprising metadata of different modalities becomes available in digital libraries and research data repositories. However, the large amounts and heterogeneity of artefacts in these repositories compromise their accessibility for common domain analysis tasks, as domain researchers lack a structural overview of the spatial, temporal, and categorical traits of the artefacts in these collections. Still, researchers need to compare artefacts along different modalities, put them into context, and deal with possible uncertainties, subjectivities, or missing data. To date, many works support domain research via interactive visualisation. The majority relies primarily on visualisation of text and metadata including spatiotemporal, image and shape data. However, fewer consider these types of data in a tightly coupled way. We present an approach for tightly integrated multimodal visual exploration of large CH data collections along space, time and shape traits. Based on requirements obtained in collaboration with domain researchers, we introduce a set of interlinked views for exploration of said modalities. An appropriately defined approach automatically computes most significant correlations across different modalities, guiding the user towards detecting interesting artefact relationships. We apply our approach to pertinent archaeological data collections, and demonstrate that characteristic explorative tasks are effectively supported and domain-relevant artefact relations can be discovered. © 2020 The Author(s) Eurographics Proceedings © 2020 The Eurographics Association.

AB  - Current science communication has a number of drawbacks and bottlenecks which have been subject of discussion lately: Among others, the rising number of published articles makes it nearly impossible to get a full overview of the state of the art in a certain field, or reproducibility is hampered by fixed-length, document-based publications which normally cannot cover all details of a research work. Recently, several initiatives have proposed knowledge graphs (KGs) for organising scientific information as a solution to many of the current issues. The focus of these proposals is, however, usually restricted to very specific use cases. In this paper, we aim to transcend this limited perspective by presenting a comprehensive analysis of requirements for an Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) by (a) collecting daily core tasks of a scientist, (b) establishing their consequential requirements for a KG-based system, (c) identifying overlaps and specificities, and their coverage in current solutions. As a result, we map necessary and desirable requirements for successful KG-based science communication, derive implications and outline possible solutions. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This paper reports on challenges and solution approaches in the development of methods for language resource overarching data analysis in the field of language documentation. It is based on the successful outcomes of the initial phase of an 18 year long-term project on lesser resourced and mostly endangered indigenous languages from the Northern Eurasian area, which included the finalization and publication of multiple language corpora and additional language resources. While aiming at comprehensive cross-resource data analysis, the project is simultaneously confronted with a dynamic and complex resource landscape, that especially results from a vast amount of multi-layered information stored in the form of analogue primary data in different widespread archives on the territory of the Russian Federation. The described methods aim at solving the tension between the needs for unification of heterogenous data sets and vocabularies on the one hand and maximum openness for the integration of future resources and the adaption of external information on the other hand. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC

AB  - Visualization as a means to generate hypotheses and to communicate insights on digitized cultural heritage data sets has become more and more important in the recent years. While many digital humanities researchers transform their data in order to be processed with ready-to-use tools, others engage in interdisciplinary collaborations with visualization scholars aiming to design novel solutions and interactive visual interfaces as occurring data features are more carefully mapped to visual attributes. Many of those collaborations suffer from loss of time at the beginning of the project as scholars with diverse research backgrounds require to understand each others' mindsets, ways of thinking and research interests. This paper reports on three years of teaching visualization design for digital humanities projects. It provides an overview of theoretical course contents, practical training, collaboration setups-involving computer science, digital humanities as well as humanities students who experienced typical collaboration obstacles-and remarkable project results.

AB  - The paper presents recent work on the design and development of AI chatbots for museums using Knowledge Graphs (KGs). The utilization of KGs as a key technology for implementing chatbots raises not only issues related to the representation and structuring of exhibits’ knowledge in suitable formalism and models, but also issues related to the translation of natural language dialogues to and from the selected technology for the formal representation and structuring of information and knowledge. Moreover, such a translation must be as transparent as possible to visitors, towards a realistic human-like question-answering process. The paper reviews and evaluates a number of recent approaches for the use of KGs in developing AI chatbots, as well as key tools that provide solutions for natural language translation and the querying of Knowledge Bases and Linked Open Data sources. This evaluation aims to provide answers to issues that are identified within the proposed MuBot approach for designing and implementing AI chatbots for museums. The paper also presents Cretan MuBot, the first experimental KG/Ontology-based AI chatbot of the MuBot Platform, which is under development in the Heracleum Archaeological Museum. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The lack of a definition of what it means to teach Digital Humanities (DH) that is unanimously agreed upon allows us to reflect on educational objectives and methodologies with the aim of shaping the identity of the digital humanist. The opening of the international Master's degree program in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge (DHDK) at the University of Bologna aims to contribute to the discussion by developing a possible DH teaching model. Setting out from the experience developed through this project, the Knowledge Organization and Cultural Heritage (KO and CH) course, one of the first year's compulsory modules, has been designed following a specific principle. While teaching how to move from data to knowledge and how to manage this process as an iterative workflow, this course emphasises the role of DH theories, methodologies and techniques. This paper aims to introduce the scope and content of the KO and CH course. In particular, it focuses on the guidelines required to create a project in the domain of Linked open data, by working on data, models and methods coming from libraries, archives and museums (LODLAM). Linked open data (LOD) is considered to be the primary methodology for managing KO issues in the context of LAM. For what concerns the interpretation of cultural heritage memories, the implementation of DH theories and methodologies is the added value to the project's design, modelling and implementation. © 2020 Associazione Italiana Biblioteche.

AB  - LIBKGE1 is an open-source PyTorch-based library for training, hyperparameter optimization, and evaluation of knowledge graph embedding models for link prediction. The key goals of LIBKGE are to enable reproducible research, to provide a framework for comprehensive experimental studies, and to facilitate analyzing the contributions of individual components of training methods, model architectures, and evaluation methods. LIBKGE is highly configurable and every experiment can be fully reproduced with a single configuration file. Individual components are decoupled to the extent possible so that they can be mixed and matched with each other. Implementations in LIBKGE aim to be as efficient as possible without leaving the scope of Python/Numpy/PyTorch. A comprehensive logging mechanism and tooling facilitates indepth analysis. LIBKGE provides implementations of common knowledge graph embedding models and training methods, and new ones can be easily added. A comparative study (Ruffinelli et al., 2020) showed that LIBKGE reaches competitive to state-of-the-art performance for many models with a modest amount of automatic hyperparameter tuning. © 2020 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - We propose the philosophical notion of the fold as an evocative vocabulary for the design and critique of interactive data visualizations. An expanding range of application areas, such as digital art history and literary studies, illustrates the potential of data visualization for research and education in the humanities. Coinciding with the increasing currency of data as evidence in the humanities, this research addresses a growing interest in data visualization for visual analysis and argumentation. For example, cultural collection visualizations promise a range of possibilities for visual and interactive representations of digital cultural heritage, used both for free exploration and focused research. Based on the concept of the fold, prominently advanced by Gilles Deleuze, this paper outlines a critical framework that draws attention towards the complexity of the underlying data. The fold offers a way to analyze and conceptualize visualizations through the lens of three integrated operations: Explication, implication, and complication. It is an opportunity to think of interactive visualizations as portals into coherent, elastic, and ultimately infinite information spaces. Accordingly, it rejects the separation between interactivity and visual encoding and draws attention to the transitions between multiple states of a visualization. We identify design patterns of the fold in data visualizations, devise a framework for the critical interpretation of interactivity in data visualization, and demonstrate the implications for the digital humanities. © 2020, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

AB  - Medical knowledge is complex. The knowledge graph provides an efficient solution for integrating medical knowledge and analyzing medical data. In this paper, the neurosurgery knowledge graph is constructed. First, the ontology pattern library is constructed, and then named entity recognition is performed based on the Bi-LSTM-CRF model. The entities are extracted from the text and the entity relationships are defined. The knowledge graph of the symptom-disease-department is integrated, and finally stored in Neo4j Graph database. As the basis of information retrieval, intelligent question answering, diagnosis and treatment system, knowledge graph can effectively transfer medical knowledge and provide intelligent medical assistance for doctors and patients.  © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Motivated by the Foreword of Licklider's Libraries of the Future (dedicated to Vannevar Bush) [5], this keynote focuses on users, exploration [15], and future directions of the digital library (DL) field, which moves toward procognitive systems. Many different digital library users, each a member of a Society, engage in a diversity of Scenarios, often involving some aspect of exploration, usually of the DL content Streams. Services - e.g., searching, browsing, recommending, and visualizing - help those users leverage knowledge Structures and Spatial representations. Following on the final sentence of Licklider's book, we call for a formal base plus an overlay of experience, leading to a new way to build better DLs. Licklider said we seek the facts, concepts, principles, and ideas that lie behind the visible and tangible aspects of documents, to help us acquire and use knowledge. Put simply: The console of the procognitive system will have two special buttons, a silver one labeled 'Where am I and a gold one labeled 'What should I do next' How can we build and use this For more than 55 years, researchers have applied artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP), representations (data, information, knowledge), question-answering, databases, human- computer interaction, and other techniques described by Licklider, to these challenges. We have a vast range of hardware and software services available, but without a more formal approach, will not enable adaptive self-organization and tailored exploration. The 5S framework [1-3, 12] can help us build, apply, and improve [9, 14] digital libraries to facilitate exploration [13], through a formal approach that will simplify such efforts, making them extensible through both human and computing agents. For example, to more easily build DLs, we propose collaboratively building knowledge graphs [8] - involving both User eXperience [4] designers, subject matter experts, and developers - that specify connections to services and workflows, enabling DL operation atop a workflow engine [6]. User exploration, additional help by UX designers, recommendations of adaptations of existing workflows, and AI-based optimizations and solutions to new problems, will all expand the knowledge graph to ensure new and more helpful assistance. When this is accomplished, we must teach and learn about this next generation of digital libraries, further developing suitable curriculum and educational modules, that rest upon a solid theoretical foundation, helping spread understanding of key concepts and best practices [10, 11]. © 2020.

AB  - With the advent in advanced computing methodologies and forward-thinking data storage needs over the last decade, there has been a major drive for reformatting archival collections to enable advanced computational analysis. In this paper, we present our digital compendium of music from the Arab Mashriq and Western Indian Ocean comprising two music collections drawn from Library materials and field recordings at the New York University Abu Dhabi. This is at once the product and object of our ongoing research at the intersection of cultural heritage preservation and computational analysis. Through computational-ethnomusicological research, we explore the cross-cultural similarities, interactions, and patterns from the music excerpts in order to understand their similarity space by employing audio analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques. Besides the digital artifactual value, pedagogical/educational and scholarly outcomes, we focus on attracting user-friendly and community engagement into appreciating the music from this region. This is done by providing interactive visualizations of the musical features on a dashboard application and 3-D rendering of the mappings in a VR environment. The VR experience is not only immersive but also provides a scope for appreciation, learning, and dissemination of the music from the region. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Scientific articles are typically published as PDF documents, thus rendering the extraction and analysis of results a cumbersome, error-prone, and often manual effort. New initiatives, such as ORKG, focus on transforming the content and results of scientific articles into structured, machine-readable representations using Semantic Web technologies. In this article, we focus on tabular data of scientific articles, which provide an organized and compressed representation of information. However, chart visualizations can additionally facilitate their comprehension. We present an approach that employs a human-in-the-loop paradigm during the data acquisition phase to define additional semantics for tabular data. The additional semantics guide the creation of chart visualizations for meaningful representations of tabular data. Our approach organizes tabular data into different information groups which are analyzed for the selection of suitable visualizations. The set of suitable visualizations serves as a user-driven selection of visual representations. Additionally, customization for visual representations provides the means for facilitating the understanding and sense-making of information. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This study employs a knowledge graph approach to realize the representation and association of information resources, promote the research, teaching, and dissemination of Dunhuang cultural heritage (CH). The Dunhuang Mogao Grottoes is a UNESCO world CH site, and digitization of Dunhuang CH has produced a large amount of information resources. However, these digitized resources continue to lack the systematic granular semantic representation required to correlate Dunhuang cultural heritage information (CHI) in order to facilitate efficient research and appreciation. To respond to this need, new approaches for representing CHI are being developed. This study identifies five facets and their semantic relationship to Dunhuang CH, constructs an ontology model to regulate the entities, attributes, and relationships of Dunhuang CH knowledge, and subsequently processes the resulting data using various techniques (such as semantic annotation and entity association) to facilitate rendering the data in a knowledge graph construction. Finally, we constructed a DH-oriented knowledge graph service platform in order to provide a user friendly visual display and semantic retrieval service. © 2020 International Society for Knowledge Organization.

AB  - This paper introduces an automatic question answering system which aimed to provide online how-to instructions for volunteers of Tree Hole Rescue–a Chinese online suicide rescue organization. When a volunteer needs to make sure how to deal with a rescue task professionally, he/she could ask this system via its WeChat public account other than reading a rescue instruction menu book. Firstly, a Tree Hole Rescue question-answer knowledge graph was constructed to manage Tree Hole Rescue question-answer knowledge and its relationship. Then, based on this semantic technology, a question in Chinese natural language was parsed into a machine-readable logical language through the question preprocessing and entity mapping process. And, a candidate question set was generated through a hierarchical information retrieval strategy. Finally, an exact or close answer and recommended similar questions were sent to the asker after calculating words sequence similarity via an algorithm which combined word form and semantic features. If the system could not match an answer for a question, the question would be added to unsolved question list and the system would alert administrator to deal with it. System testing shew that the Q&A system has a high accuracy rate in response of Tree Hole Rescue questions. Meanwhile, this system provides a series of methods to improve the update capability of the Q&A library and the scalability of the system. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Knowledge graph matching is an approach to create entity mappings of structured data with linked data sources. As an automated approach, this paper explains a sparql query based matching engine developed during the Columns-Property Annotation (CPA) Challenge under ISWC 2020 SemTab challenge (Semantic Web Challenge on Tabular Data to Knowledge Graph Matching). The proposed approach utilizes a text correction via different knowledge base services/libraries as well as numeric interval definitions to identify negligible numeric differences. The approach (submitted as TeamTR) achived, in the CPA task, F1-scores of 0.916. 0.873 and 0.837 in Rounds 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Copyright © 2020 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - In recent years, the use of multimodal human-computer interaction technology to achieve the enhancement of human intelligence has become a new topic in human-computer interaction research. When the robot can't react correctly in a single mode, it is necessary to realize multimodal fusion. To this end, this paper proposes a multimodal fusion algorithm that applies the data obtained by the CNN feature layer to the decision-level. The speech recognition text is semantically matched with the text in the text library, and the similar probability vector is returned. At the same time, the similarity probability vector of the gesture recognition is obtained, and the data is filtered by the threshold, and the set of high probability data codes is assigned to the two modes. The intersection operation, and the final instruction is sent to the robot. The experimental results show that the influence of environmental factors on the single channel result is reduced, and the single mode ambiguity problem is eliminated. The multi-channel fusion algorithm with additional weight is more accurate than the common multi-channel fusion algorithm. At the same time, it has also been well received by many test users. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Digitisation has become a common practice in the preservation of museum collections. Recent development of photogrammetry techniques allows for more accessible acquisition of three-dimensional (3D) models that serve as accurate representations of their originals. One of the potential applications of this is presenting digital collections as virtual museums to engage the public. Medical museums, particularly, would benefit from digitisation of their collections as many of them are closed to the public. The aim of this project was to design and create an interactive virtual museum which would represent the Anatomy Museum at the University of Glasgow with key specimens digitised using photogrammetry techniques. Members of the general public (25 participants) were asked to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of the interactive application by completing questionnaires. A process to digitise anatomical specimens using photogrammetry and convert them into game-ready 3D models was developed. The results demonstrated successful generation of 3D models of specimens preserved using different techniques, including specimens preserved in fluid and glass jars. User tests and evaluation of the application by members of the general public were positive, with participants agreeing that they would now consider visiting the real museum after using the virtual version. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Scientific knowledge has been traditionally disseminated and preserved through research articles published in journals, conference proceedings, and online archives. However, this article-centric paradigm has been often criticized for not allowing to automatically process, categorize, and reason on this knowledge. An alternative vision is to generate a semantically rich and interlinked description of the content of research publications. In this paper, we present the Artificial Intelligence Knowledge Graph (AI-KG), a large-scale automatically generated knowledge graph that describes 820K research entities. AI-KG includes about 14M RDF triples and 1.2M reified statements extracted from 333K research publications in the field of AI, and describes 5 types of entities (tasks, methods, metrics, materials, others) linked by 27 relations. AI-KG has been designed to support a variety of intelligent services for analyzing and making sense of research dynamics, supporting researchers in their daily job, and helping to inform decision-making in funding bodies and research policymakers. AI-KG has been generated by applying an automatic pipeline that extracts entities and relationships using three tools: DyGIE++, Stanford CoreNLP, and the CSO Classifier. It then integrates and filters the resulting triples using a combination of deep learning and semantic technologies in order to produce a high-quality knowledge graph. This pipeline was evaluated on a manually crafted gold standard, yielding competitive results. AI-KG is available under CC BY 4.0 and can be downloaded as a dump or queried via a SPARQL endpoint. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Entity alignment seeks to find entities in different knowledge graphs (KGs) that refer to the same real-world object. Recent advancement in KG embedding impels the advent of embedding-based entity alignment, which encodes entities in a continuous embedding space and measures entity similarities based on the learned embeddings. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study of this emerging field. We survey 23 recent embedding-based entity alignment approaches and categorize them based on their techniques and characteristics. We also propose a new KG sampling algorithm, with which we generate a set of dedicated benchmark datasets with various heterogeneity and distributions for a realistic evaluation. We develop an open-source library including 12 representative embedding-based entity alignment approaches, and extensively evaluate these approaches, to understand their strengths and limitations. Additionally, for several directions that have not been explored in current approaches, we perform exploratory experiments and report our preliminary findings for future studies. The benchmark datasets, open-source library and experimental results are all accessible online and will be duly maintained. © 2020, VLDB Endowment.

AB  - Long lecture video metadata needs to have topic wise annotation information for quick topic searching and video browsing. In this work we perform topical segmentation of long MOOC lecture videos to obtain start-time and end-time of different topics taught by the instructor. During teaching instructor uses different concepts to explain a topic. So instructor has his own way of selecting and binding these concepts to represent a topic. Additionally knowledge graph of a subject domain contains inherent domain knowledge. In this work we analyze how the instructor changes concepts during topic change, the inherent knowledge available in a domain knowledge graph, semantic similarity and contextual relationship between different concepts to perform topical segmentation of long lecture videos. As output, we get semantically coherent topics taught by the instructor along with their interval (start-time and end-time). We tested our approach on 61 long NPTEL[1] videos delivered on software engineering domain. Experimentally we find that the topic intervals generated by our system has ∼ 83% similarity with the intervals present in the ground truth. Holistic evaluation shows that our approach performs better than the other approaches in the literature. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Open domain relation prediction is an important task in triples extraction. When faced with the task of constructing large-scale knowledge graph systems, with the exception of structured data, it is necessary to automatically extract triples from a large amount of unstructured text to expand entities and relations. Although a large number of English open relation prediction methods have achieved good performance, the high-performance system for open domain Chinese triples extraction remains undeveloped due to the lack of large-scale Chinese annotation corpora and the difficulty of Chinese language processing. In this paper, we propose an integrated open domain Chinese triples hierarchical extraction method (CTHE) to solve this problem, considering the advantages of Bi-LSTM-CRF and Att-Bi-GRU models based on the pre-trained BERT encoding model. This method can recognize the named entities from Chinese sentences to establish entity pairs, and implement hierarchical extraction of specific and open relations based on the user-defined schema library and attention mechanism. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, which achieved stable performance on the test dataset, and better precision and F1-score in comparison with state-of-the-art Chinese open domain triples extraction methods. Furthermore, a large-scale annotated dataset for a Chinese named entity recognition (NER) task is established, which provides support for research on Chinese NER tasks. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Currently, a trend to augment document collections with entity-centric knowledge provided by knowledge graphs is clearly visible, especially in scientific digital libraries. Entity facts are either manually curated, or for higher scalability automatically harvested from large volumes of text documents. The often claimed benefit is that a collection-wide fact extraction combines information from huge numbers of documents into one single database. However, even if the extraction process would be 100% correct, the promise of pervasive information fusion within retrieval tasks poses serious threats with respect to the results’ validity. This is because important contextual information provided by each document is often lost in the process and cannot be readily restored at retrieval time. In this paper, we quantify the consequences of uncontrolled knowledge graph evolution in real-world scientific libraries using NLM’s PubMed corpus vs. the SemMedDB knowledge base. Moreover, we operationalise the notion of implicit context as a viable solution to gain a sense of context compatibility for all extracted facts based on the pair-wise coherence of all documents used for extraction: Our derived measures for context compatibility determine which facts are relatively safe to combine. Moreover, they allow to balance between precision and recall. Our practical experiments extensively evaluate context compatibility based on implicit contexts for typical digital library tasks. The results show that our implicit notion of context compatibility is superior to existing methods in terms of both, simplicity and retrieval quality. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Knowledge graphs are widely used for systematic representation of real-world data. Large-scale, general purpose knowledge graphs, having millions of facts, have been constructed through automated techniques from publicly available datasets such as Wikipedia. However, these knowledge graphs are typically incomplete and often fail to correctly capture the semantics of the data. This holds true particularly for domain-specific data, where the generic techniques for automated knowledge graph creation often fail due to several challenges, such as lack of training data, semantic ambiguities and absence of representative ontologies. The focus of this thesis is on automated knowledge graph construction for the cultural heritage domain. The goal is to tackle the research challenges encountered during the creation of an ontology and a knowledge graph from digitized collections of cultural heritage data. This paper identifies the specific research problems for these tasks and presents a methodology and approach for a solution, along with preliminary results. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - One of the most time-consuming tasks that researchers usually have to undergo is finding existing, relevant papers to study and cite in their articles. Manual effort that involves searching relevant papers using keywords not only is time-consuming, but also yields low recall. To mitigate these issues, many automatic citation recommendation methods that find possible citations, using a matrix to represent citation graph, and extracting features to predict citations relevant to the input article, have been proposed. A majority of these methods, however, are proximity-based, which lack global knowledge of the entire citation graph. In this paper, we present a preliminary investigation on a novel approach to recommend citations via knowledge graph embedding. Specifically, ConvCN, an extension of ConvKB algorithm designed for citation knowledge graph embedding, is proposed. We evaluate our approach against the state-of-the-art baselines on WN18RR dataset and citation datasets. The empirical results, using the link prediction protocol, show that the proposed method outperforms all baseline methods in all datasets. © 2020. ACM ISBN.

AB  - As the number of published scientific papers continuously increases, the need to assess paper impact becomes more valuable than ever. In this work, we focus on citation-based measures that try to estimate the popularity (current impact) of an article. State-of-the-art methods in this category calculate estimates of popularity based on paper citation data. However, with respect to recent publications, only limited data of this type are available, rendering these measures prone to inaccuracies. In this work, we present ArtSim, an approach that exploits paper similarity, calculated using scholarly knowledge graphs, to better estimate paper popularity for recently published papers. Our approach is designed to be applied on top of existing popularity measures, to improve their accuracy. We apply ArtSim on top of four well-known popularity measures and demonstrate through experiments its potential in improving their popularity estimates. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This article is a proof-of-concept case study to evaluate the functionality of a block metaphor–based linked data generator. In this work, we chose to produce linked data repository of recipes, which provide a medium for people to share their regional and healthy recipes with the masses. However, the same approach can also be adapted easily to other domains. Therefore, the applicability of our approach extends well beyond the food domain that we are considering in this article. As a medium for information sharing and understanding between heterogeneous systems, ontologies will play an important role in the realisation of the Internet of things (IoT) vision. Therefore, an ontology-based recipe repository would also be one of the basic blocks of a smart kitchen environment. However, building ontologies is a challenging task, especially for users who are not conversant in the ontology building languages. This article proposes an approach that can be used even by non-experts and facilitates the sharing and searching of recipe data. In our case, we exploit the features of the block paradigm to publish recipes in Linked Data format. In this way, users do not have to know the OWL (Web Ontology Language) syntax and the text input is kept minimal. As far as we know, this article is the first study that produces linked data using Blockly in the literature. We also conducted a user-based evaluation of the proposed approach using the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Recently, with the advancement of technologies in AI and Knowledge Base, several museums are using chatbots for visitors. One of the problems with these technologies, however is that gradually tends to be of no real interest to visitors owing to the lack of significant interaction, this eventually distracts visitors from experiencing the exhibits. In the demo, we present AIMuBot, an interactive system for searching the information from the museum's knowledge base with natural language. The system has the following characteristics: (1) It supports natural language voice-based interaction with the visitors to ask questions; (2) It provides a voice-based graphical interface to help visitors refine the questions. (3) It retrieves information from the knowledge base for the visitors. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Scientists are harnessing their multi-disciplinary expertise and resources to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Aligned with this mindset, the Covid-on-the-Web project aims to allow biomedical researchers to access, query and make sense of COVID-19 related literature. To do so, it adapts, combines and extends tools to process, analyze and enrich the “COVID-19 Open Research Dataset” (CORD-19) that gathers 50,000+ full-text scientific articles related to the coronaviruses. We report on the RDF dataset and software resources produced in this project by leveraging skills in knowledge representation, text, data and argument mining, as well as data visualization and exploration. The dataset comprises two main knowledge graphs describing (1) named entities mentioned in the CORD-19 corpus and linked to DBpedia, Wikidata and other BioPortal vocabularies, and (2) arguments extracted using ACTA, a tool automating the extraction and visualization of argumentative graphs, meant to help clinicians analyze clinical trials and make decisions. On top of this dataset, we provide several visualization and exploration tools based on the Corese Semantic Web platform, MGExplorer visualization library, as well as the Jupyter Notebook technology. All along this initiative, we have been engaged in discussions with healthcare and medical research institutes to align our approach with the actual needs of the biomedical community, and we have paid particular attention to comply with the open and reproducible science goals, and the FAIR principles. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Many public services and entertainment industries utilise Mixed Reality (MR) devices to develop highly immersive and interactive applications. However, recent advancements in MR processing has prompted the tourist and events industry to invest and develop commercial applications. The museum environment provides an accessible platform for MR guidance systems by taking advantage of the ergonomic freedom of spatial holographical Head-mounted Displays (HMD). The application of MR systems in museums can enhance the typical visitor experience by amalgamating historical interactive visualisations simultaneously with related physical artefacts and displays. Current approaches in MR guidance research primarily focus on visitor engagement with specific content. This paper describes the design and development of a novel museum guidance system based on the immersion and presence theory. This approach examines the influence of interactivity, spatial mobility, and perceptual awareness of individuals within MR environments. The developmental framework of a prototype MR tour guide program named MuseumEye incorporates the sociological needs, behavioural patterns, and accessibility of the user. This study aims to create an alternative tour guidance system to enhance customer experience and reduce the number of human tour guides in museums. The data gathering procedure examines the functionality of the MuseumEye application in conjunction with pre-existing pharaonic exhibits in a museum environment. This methodology includes a qualitative questionnaire sampling 102 random visitors to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Results of this research study indicate a high rate of positive responses to the MR tour guide system, and the functionality of AR HMD in a museum environment. This outcome reinforces the suitability of the touring system to increase visitor experience in museums, galleries and cultural heritage sites. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The chemical terrorist attack is a type of unconventional terrorism that threatens the safety of cities. This kind of terrorist attack is highly concealed and difficult to be detected. Once the attack is successful, the consequences will be severe and the scope of impact will be enormous. Therefore, public security and emergency departments need to perform risk analysis and dynamic knowledge update to reduce risk or mitigate the effects of accidents. In order to quickly and effectively analyze the risk of chemical terrorist attacks, this article proposed a hybrid approach (B-R model) to analyze the risk of chemical terrorist attacks. First, a modular and customizable Bayesian network (BN) model library was built, which can satisfy users to select multi-dimensional risk factors. Based on the personalized BN, a risk knowledge graph (RKG) is constructed with multi-source data to realize the combination of risk analysis and knowledge acquisition. Then the threat degree of terrorist organizations, the strength of defensive forces, and the risk value of targets is calculated and displayed. The BN-RKG method provides data and theoretical support for defenders' resource allocation and emergency decision-making. Finally, a case study was conducted for a hypothetical scenario analysis. The result shows that the hybrid method can help with risk control and have the potential to support practical policymaking. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Recently, many Resource Description Framework (RDF) data generation tools have been developed to convert geospatial and non-geospatial data into RDF data. Furthermore, there are several interlinking frameworks that find semantically equivalent geospatial resources in related RDF data sources. However, many existing Linked Open Data sources are currently sparsely interlinked. Also, many RDF generation and interlinking frameworks require a solid knowledge of Semantic Web and Geospatial Semantic Web concepts to successfully deploy them. This article comparatively evaluates features and functionality of the current state-of-the-art geospatial RDF generation tools and interlinking frameworks. This evaluation is specifically performed for cultural heritage researchers and professionals who have limited expertise in computer programming. Hence, a set of criteria has been defined to facilitate the selection of tools and frameworks. In addition, the article provides a methodology to generate geospatial cultural heritage RDF data and to interlink it with the related RDF data. This methodology uses a CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) ontology and interlinks the RDF data with DBpedia. Although this methodology has been developed for cultural heritage researchers and professionals, it may also be used by other domain professionals. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Understanding, monitoring, and predicting the flow of knowledge between academia and industry is of critical importance for a variety of stakeholders, including governments, funding bodies, researchers, investors, and companies. To this purpose, we introduce ResearchFlow, an approach that integrates semantic technologies and machine learning to quantifying the diachronic behaviour of research topics across academia and industry. ResearchFlow exploits the novel Academia/Industry DynAmics (AIDA) Knowledge Graph in order to characterize each topic according to the frequency in time of the related i) publications from academia, ii) publications from industry, iii) patents from academia, and iv) patents from industry. This representation is then used to produce several analytics regarding the academia/industry knowledge flow and to forecast the impact of research topics on industry. We applied ResearchFlow to a dataset of 3.5M papers and 2M patents in Computer Science and highlighted several interesting patterns. We found that 89.8% of the topics first emerge in academic publications, which typically precede industrial publications by about 5.6 years and industrial patents by about 6.6 years. However this does not mean that academia always dictates the research agenda. In fact, our analysis also shows that industrial trends tend to influence academia more than academic trends affect industry. We evaluated ResearchFlow on the task of forecasting the impact of research topics on the industrial sector and found that its granular characterization of topics improves significantly the performance with respect to alternative solutions. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In the era of precision medicine, clinicians need intensive and comprehensive evidence to conduct research and make decisions. However, current knowledge bases are isolated and lack integration with information from other databases or literature, constituting an obstacle for clinicians to locate and understand their interested relations. In this paper, we design a platform development methodology to construct and visualize a biomedical knowledge graph combining text mining tools and knowledge fusion models with web interface libraries. The platform thereby provides the functions of knowledge acquisition, integration, storage, search and visualization, where each concept in the relation is described by its properties, each relation in the database is located to sentences and each paragraph in the article is translated into Chinese. To further validate the feasibility and practicability, we applied the methodology to the “gene-mutation-disease” field and built a Biomedical Relation of Gene-mUtation-diseasE (BROGUE) platform. The platform included 590 high-quality gene-mutation-disease relations covering a wide range of commonly-used gene (286), mutation (525) and disease (347) concepts by October 2019. Two tests demonstrated that BROGUE has potential to be useful for supporting biomedical research and clinical decisions. The platform has been deployed and is publicly available at http://brogue.medmdt.net/. Copyright © 2020 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved

AB  - In this paper we present our work on the design and evaluation of a web-based digital archive. The aim of this research project was to explore ways of enabling easy access to materials about their cultural heritage for indigenous people. In this project we worked in close collaboration with the Sami people across brainstorming sessions, design workshops, prototype development, and user tests. During this process we became aware of two intertwined sensitivities, i.e. a cultural sensitivity and a design sensitivity - and we refer to this as a "double sensitivity". The data recorded from the interviews and the participants' interaction with the prototype were analyzed using thematic analysis as the methodological approach. Our results pointed at five main code clusters including: tonality of the design, usability, sociability, ethical considerations and technical errors. In this paper we discuss these findings, and we suggest that our results, and the proposed notion of "double sensitivity" contributes important research on human computer interaction (HCI) design for indigenous people. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - We present Reef (Recursive Evidence Extraction Framework), a Python framework for automated information extraction from Petroleum Geoscience databases. Reef enables an end to end pipeline from raw documents to a Knowledge Graph. Reef makes possible two essential operations: 1/ discover entities in documents, characterize them and connect them to abstract concepts present in a knowledge graph and 2/ discover new knowledge with distant supervision. Knowledge graphs are key to build better search engines, Question Answering systems, recommendation engines, feed algorithms for the cross analysis of multiple datasets. Reef unique approach leverages a comprehensive stack of open source and state-of-the-art libraries for documents digitalization and parsing, Natural Language Processing, Language Modeling, Logic Reasoning and Graph Analysis. These foundational components are seconded by custom applications for specific tasks. Documents processed in Reef are digitized and sent through a pipeline where their content is filtered according to a flexible, easily extensible, Petroleum Geoscience specific object model. Information can be extracted from text, tables, figures, diagrams. Reef contains functions to infer information nature, digitize it, disambiguate and reconcile it into a graph database. Reef can be deployed in any cloud and delivers production ready knowledge graphs which can be served to third party applications. © EAGE 2019.

AB  - Currently, most of the health-data research concentrates on applying Deep Learning technologies for prediction and reasoning. Deep Learning processes build the prediction model purely based on fitting weights on the raw data inside multiple neural layers, which is difficult to explain the prediction outputs. However, telling 'WHY' is crucial for healthcare research. The major difficulty to explain in Deep Learning models is a lack of knowledge-based analysis environment that not only can model the knowledge in a machine-understandable way but also can create causal probability relations inside the knowledge. In our research, we propose a Causal Probability Description Logic (CPDL) framework that extended the current Description Logic (DL). The key extension is to have a two-layer DL representation. One layer represents causality knowledge. The other layer takes observation inputs e.g. symptoms for generating a runtime probability knowledge graph based on the previous layer's knowledge. The CPDL framework can support probability-based causal reasoning tasks in a transparent and human-understandable way. CPDL can be easily implemented using existing programming standards such as OWL, RDF, SPARQL and probability network programming libraries. The experimental evaluations extract 383 common disease conditions from the UK NHS (National Healthcare Service) and enable automatically linked 418 condition terms from the DBpedia dataset. The CPDL-based knowledge graph can support disease prediction with traceable pieces of evidence behind the ranking results.  © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Multi-light, single-camera imaging techniques like Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI, including PTM, HSH, and PCA-RBF) and the Portable Light Dome (PLD) have been used by cultural heritage scholars and collection curators extensively because of the extra interactive visual information that can be revealed on artefacts when compared to standard digital photography. Besides a virtual relighting of the scanned object, these techniques offer filters to accentuate different aspects of the studied surface. The main focus of RTI, developed at HP, CHI and among others elaborated by ISTI CNR, is aimed at photo-realistic virtual relighting. PLD, developed at KU Leuven, on the other hand, is aimed at extracting surface properties such as surface color (albedo), surface gradient (normals), 3D surface features (height profiles) and reflectance distribution (reflectance maps). PLD and RTI both produce interactive pixel based file formats, which are dissimilar, resulting in incompatible datasets. The pixel+ project (Art and History Museum, KU Leuven, and KBR, Belspo BRAIN-be funded) aims to merge both technologies into one web-based consultation platform, allowing existing PLD and RTI datasets to be viewed in one web environment with their respective viewing filters as well as to illuminate the virtual model. Moreover, as both methods are alike in terms of required input and processed output, pixel+ focuses on other types of integration, resulting in new viewing modes for processed data as well as a novel reprocessing pipeline for existing source images. In addition, for sustainable and flexible web consultation a new open format, based on glTF, is suggested and a first elaboration is presented. © 2020 SPIE

AB  - This paper discusses knowledge graphs and networks on the scientific process from a philological viewpoint. Relevant themes are: the smallest entities of scientific discourse; the treatment of documents or artefacts as texts and commentaries in discourse; and links between context, (co)text, and data points. As an illustration of the micro-level approach, version control of linguistic examples is discussed as a possible field of application in this discipline. This underlines the claim for data points to be treated like unique entities, which possess metadata of the datum and any text generating knowledge from it. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Question answering systems have recently been integrated with many smart devices and search engines. Answer type prediction plays an important role in question answering systems as it can help filter irrelevant results and improve overall search and retrieval performance. Here, we present our approach for answer type prediction using the datasets provided for the International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2020) SMART Task Challenge. Predicting granular answer types for a question from a big knowledge graph is a greater challenge due to the large number of possible classes. Thus, we propose a 3-step approach to tackle the challenge task. We start with building a classifier that predicts the category of the types and build another classifier just for resource types. The latter model will predict the most general (frequent) type for each question, ignoring type hierarchy. We use a multi-class text classification algorithm built-in fastai library for these two models. The models’ accuracies are 0.95 and 0.73 for category and generic type classification respectively in the validation set (20% randomly chosen samples) of the DBPedia dataset. Next, we train a third classifier to find more specific types (sub-classes) for each question based on the previous general predicted types. We achieve 0.62 and 0.61 using NDCG@5 and NDCG@10 metrics respectively for the test set. Copyright © 2020 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Searching in a library or book catalog is a recurrent task for researchers and common users alike. Thanks to semantic enrichment techniques, such as named-entity recognition and linking, texts may be automatically associated with entities in some reference knowledge graph(s). The association of a corpus of texts with a knowledge graph opens up the way to searching/exploring using novel paradigms. We present a pipeline that uses semantic enrichment and knowledge graph visualization techniques to enable the semantic exploration of an existing text corpus. The pipeline is meant to be ready for use and consists of existing free software tools and free software code contributed by us. We are developing and testing the pipeline on the field, by using it to access the catalog of a bookstore specialized in ancient Rome history. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In the past years significant research efforts were invested towards the usage of Named Entity recommendation for improving information retrieval in large and heterogeneous data repositories. Such technology is employed nowadays to better understand user’s search intention, to improve search precision and to enhance user experience in web portals. Within the current paper we present a case study on recommending Named Entities for enhancing multilingual retrieval in Europe’s digital platform for cultural heritage. The challenges of designing an entity auto-suggestion service able to effectively support users searching for information in Europeana.eu are described in the paper together with a preliminary experimental evaluation and the outline indicating the directions for future development. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Academia and industry are constantly engaged in a joint effort for producing scientific knowledge that will shape the society of the future. Analysing the knowledge flow between them and understanding how they influence each other is a critical task for researchers, governments, funding bodies, investors, and companies. However, current corpora are unfit to support large-scale analysis of the knowledge flow between academia and industry since they lack of a good characterization of research topics and industrial sectors. In this short paper, we introduce the Academia/Industry DynAmics (AIDA) Knowledge Graph, which characterizes 14M papers and 8M patents according to the research topics drawn from the Computer Science Ontology. 4M papers and 5M patents are also classified according to the type of the author’s affiliations (academy, industry, or collaborative) and 66 industrial sectors (e.g., automotive, financial, energy, electronics) obtained from DBpedia. AIDA was generated by an automatic pipeline that integrates several knowledge graphs and bibliographic corpora, including Microsoft Academic Graph, Dimensions, English DBpedia, the Computer Science Ontology, and the Global Research Identifier Database. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is an important intangible cultural heritage of China. To enhance the services of TCM, many works focus on constructing various types of TCM knowledge graphs according to the concrete requirements such as information retrieval. However, most of them ignored several key issues. One is temporal information that is very important for TCM clinical diagnosis and treatment. For example, a herb needs to be boiled for different periods in different prescriptions, but existing methods cannot represent this temporal information very well. The other is that current TCM-based retrieval systems cannot effectively deal with the temporal intentions of search sentences, which leads to bad experiences for users in retrieval services. To solve these issues, we propose a new model tailored for TCM based on the temporal knowledge graph in this paper, which can effectively represent the clinical knowledge changing dynamically over time. Moreover, we implement a temporal semantic search system and employ reasoning rules based on our proposed model to complete the temporal intentions of search sentences. The preliminary result indicates that our system can obtain better results than existing methods in terms of precision. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.

AB  - Answering questions on scholarly knowledge comprising text and other artifacts is a vital part of any research life cycle. Querying scholarly knowledge and retrieving suitable answers is currently hardly possible due to the following primary reason: machine inactionable, ambiguous and unstructured content in publications. We present JarvisQA, a BERT based system to answer questions on tabular views of scholarly knowledge graphs. Such tables can be found in a variety of shapes in the scholarly literature (e.g., surveys, comparisons or results). Our system can retrieve direct answers to a variety of different questions asked on tabular data in articles. Furthermore, we present a preliminary dataset of related tables and a corresponding set of natural language questions. This dataset is used as a benchmark for our system and can be reused by others. Additionally, JarvisQA is evaluated on two datasets against other baselines and shows an improvement of two to three folds in performance compared to related methods. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Then we propose an Icon Knowledge Graph Model comprising the entities: iconographer, iconographic school, herminia, icon, measurements, material, technique, iconographic subject (saint or a title of the Virgin Mary), location (city, monastery, church, museum), scientific article, academic journal, issue, links to LOD datasets (e.g. VIAF, Getty AAT, ISBN, ISSN, academia.edu). Then we introduce the Virtual Encyclopedia of Bulgarian Icons (BIDL) and describe how we exported it to Wikidata, while coreferencing to iconographers, saints, locations; and the extra info we added for such entities. Finally, we describe a conversion to the Europeana Data Model, including details such as links to Wikidata, bilingual descriptions, language tags, providers.

AB  - People are one of the best known and most stable entities in the biodiversity knowledge graph. The wealth of public information associated with people and the ability to identify them uniquely open up the possibility to make more use of these data in biodiversity science. Person data are almost always associated with entities such as specimens, molecular sequences, taxonomic names, observations, images, traits and publications. For example, the digitization and the aggregation of specimen data from museums and herbaria allow us to view a scientist's specimen collecting in conjunction with the whole corpus of their works. However, the metadata of these entities are also useful in validating data, integrating data across collections and institutional databases and can be the basis of future research into biodiversity and science. In addition, the ability to reliably credit collectors for their work has the potential to change the incentive structure to promote improved curation and maintenance of natural history collections.  © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper introduces MusX, a visualization-based system that helps to search and explore a large multivariate bipartite graph of artists and songs. An additional tree structure for the song nodes is also inherited from the musical adaptation relations. In tight collaboration with a public national library and archives institution, we propose a novel artist-centered interactive set of representations, focusing on several identified user tasks. This online system is targeted towards laypersons, willing to quickly navigate artists' body of songs and explore their relationships to other artists through their implication in song creation. In this paper, we present a detailed description of MusX along with design and technical considerations, and the demonstration scenarios we intend to present to the audience. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Shelley’s Heart is a locative learning tool geo-linked to the churchyard where Mary Shelley is buried along with the heart of her husband, poet Percy Shelley. To commemorate the 200th anniversary of the publication of Frankenstein, this interactive multi-media project debuted on Halloween night, 2018. Featuring biographical facts, quotes and fictional narratives related to the Shelleys and their friends, John Keats and Lord Byron, it provides an active learning experience that is freely available to the general public. Locative projects often feature either factual information (museum audio guides), or fictional stories (ambient literature), but Shelley’s Heart combines fact and fiction in order to promote critical thinking. Refining this approach required extensive trial and error experimentation, collaborative brainstorming, user testing, and several phases of production. Insights garnered from this process led to the development of strategies that simultaneously promote implicit and explicit cognition. Cognitive science refers to this interplay as, the ‘dual process model’ [Kahneman, D. 2011. Thinking, Fast and Slow. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux]. This paper explores how the creation of Shelley’s Heart led to the development of three key dual process design strategies: ‘Match,’ ‘Affect’ and ‘Prime’, collectively known as ‘MAP’. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Learning from graph and relational data plays a major role in many applications including social network analysis, marketing, e-commerce, information retrieval, knowledge modeling, medical and biological sciences, engineering, and others. In the last few years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising new supervised learning framework capable of bringing the power of deep representation learning to graph and relational data. This ever-growing body of research has shown that GNNs achieve state-of-the-art performance for problems such as link prediction, fraud detection, target-ligand binding activity prediction, knowledge-graph completion, and product recommendations. The objective of this tutorial is twofold. First, it will provide an overview of the theory behind GNNs, discuss the types of problems that GNNs are well suited for, and introduce some of the most widely used GNN model architectures and problems/applications that are designed to solve. Second, it will introduce the Deep Graph Library (DGL), a new software framework that simplifies the development of efficient GNN-based training and inference programs. To make things concrete, the tutorial will provide hands-on sessions using DGL. This hands-on part will cover both basic graph applications (e.g., node classification and link prediction), as well as more advanced topics including training GNNs on large graphs and in a distributed setting. In addition, it will provide hands-on tutorials on using GNNs and DGL for real-world applications such as recommendation and fraud detection. © 2020 ACM.

This ever-growing body of research has shown that GNNs achieve state-of-the-art performance for problems such as link prediction, fraud detection, target-ligand binding activity prediction, knowledge-graph completion, and product recommendations. In practice, many of the real-world graphs are very large. It is urgent to have scalable solutions to train GNN on large graphs efficiently. The objective of this tutorial is twofold. First, it will provide an overview of the theory behind GNNs, discuss the types of problems that GNNs are well suited for, and introduce some of the most widely used GNN model architectures and problems/applications that are designed to solve. Second, it will introduce the Deep Graph Library (DGL), a scalable GNN framework that simplifies the development of efficient GNN-based training and inference programs at a large scale. To make things concrete, the tutorial will cover state-of-the-art training methods to scale GNN to large graphs and provide hands-on sessions to show how to use DGL to perform scalable training in different settings (multi-GPU training and distributed training). This hands-on part will start with basic graph applications (e.g., node classification and link prediction) to set up the context and move on to train GNNs on large graphs. It will provide tutorials to demonstrate how to apply the techniques in DGL to train GNNs for real-world applications. © 2020 Owner/Author.

AB  - Archives have well-established description standards, namely the ISAD(G) and ISAAR(CPF) with a hierarchical structure adapted to the nature of archival assets. However, as archives connect to a growing diversity of data, they aim to make their representations more apt to the so-called linked data cloud. The corresponding move from hierarchical, ISAD-conforming descriptions to graph counterparts requires state-of-the-art technologies, data models and vocabularies. Our approach addresses this problem from two perspectives. The first concerns the data model and description vocabularies, as we adopt and build upon the CIDOC-CRM standard. The second is the choice of technologies to support a knowledge graph, including a graph database and an Object Graph Mapping library. The case study is the Portuguese National Archives, Torre do Tombo, and the overall goal is to build a CIDOC-CRM-compliant system for document description and retrieval, to be used by professionals and the public. The early stages described here include the design of the core data model for archival records represented as the ArchOnto ontology and its embodiment in the ArchGraph knowledge graph. The goal of a semantic archival information system will be pursued in the migration of existing records to the richer representation and the development of applications supported on the graph. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Objective. The Semantic Web and Linked Data emphasize on the reuse and linking of richly described resources on the Web. This principles fits the purpose of the Europeana Data Model (EDM), which is to make use of existing resource information as well as to support their enrichment by establishing new relationships between them. The objective of this study is to describe the semantic relationships included in the elements of the EDM, as well as to highlight the advantages of using this model to represent and retrieve information digitized culture on the Web and thus encourage the adoption of semantic methodologies in Brazilian projects. Method. This is a qualitative research, based on a descriptive-document method, regarding the family of EDM documents. First we have identified the concepts and technologies of the Semantic Web and Linked Data, then we analyze the descriptive memoir of the data model of Europeana. We detail the principles and development of EDM, with an emphasis on the semantic elements that support specific functions in Europeana. Results. We have identified the possibilities of connecting data from different institutions in order to complement and enrich the information of the records about a particular cultural heritage object. Conclusions. This study showed that the semantic structure of the EDM constitutes a reference to be followed for publication of data of national Linked Open Data projects to ensure the increasing interconnection of data, to increase the speed of the circulation of the information between the interested parties and accelerate new discoveries. © 2020 University of Pittsburgh.

AB  - Third-party libraries are an integral part of many software projects. It often happens that developers need to find analogical libraries that can provide comparable features to the libraries they are already familiar with for different programming languages or different mobile platforms. Existing methods to find analogical libraries are limited by the community-curated list of libraries, blogs, or Q&A posts, which often contain overwhelming or out-of-date information. In this paper, we present a new approach to recommend analogical libraries based on a knowledge base of analogical libraries mined from tags of millions of Stack Overflow questions. The novelty of our approach is to solve analogical-library questions by combining state-of-the-art word embedding technique and domain-specific relational and categorical knowledge mined from Stack Overflow. Given a library and a recommended analogical library, our approach further extracts questions and answer snippets in Stack Overflow about comparison of analogical libraries, which can potentially offer useful information scents for developers to further their investigation of the recommended analogical libraries. We implement our approach in a proof-of-concept web application and more than 34.8 thousands of users visited our website from November 2015 to August 2017. Our evaluation shows that our approach can make accurate recommendation of analogical libraries. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our analogical-library recommendations by using them to answer analogical-library questions in Stack Overflow. Google Analytics of our website traffic and analysis of the visitors’ interaction with website contents provide the insights into the usage patterns and the system design of our web application. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - After decades of digitization, large cultural heritage collections have emerged on the web, which contain massive stocks of content from galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. This increase in digital cultural heritage data promises new modes of analysis and increased levels of access for academic scholars and casual users alike. Going beyond the standard representations of search-centric and grid-based interfaces, a multitude of approaches has recently started to enable visual access to cultural collections, and to explore them as complex and comprehensive information spaces by the means of interactive visualizations. In contrast to conventional web interfaces, we witness a widening spectrum of innovative visualization types specially designed for rich collections from the cultural heritage sector. This new class of information visualizations gives rise to a notable diversity of interaction and representation techniques while lending currency and urgency to a discussion about principles such as serendipity, generosity, and criticality in connection with visualization design. With this survey, we review information visualization approaches to digital cultural heritage collections and reflect on the state of the art in techniques and design choices. We contextualize our survey with humanist perspectives on the field and point out opportunities for future research. © 1995-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The article deals with the topic of the semantic web and the publication in linked open data of information relating to cultural heritage. In particular, the article analyzes the ontology registers, i.e. those tools that formally describe the ontological models available on the web and facilitate their retrieval and evaluation, encouraging their reuse and facilitating semantic alignment and interoperability processes. The ontology registers respond effectively to the absence of reference and orientation tools in the conceptual modeling processes of information and have been successfully tested in different domains, but are still unpublished in the cultural sphere. The examination of the initiatives carried out in the last decade in the field of cultural heritage has clearly highlighted t he lack of a consolidated epistemological structure in the conceptual modeling of information resources, despite the numerous ontologies created according to the multiple linked open data publication projects. Consequently, it is often difficult to fully understand all the ontologies available in relation to your area of interest and to obtain in a smooth and systematic way a reliable assessment of their representative capacity and their degree of semantic interoperability. The analysis of the main registers of ontologies so far created outside the domain of cultural heritage has made it possible to identify and define the requirements of a register of ontologies for cultural heritage, and to elaborate the relative ontology. The clarification of the requirements also took into account a peculiar function that the registers could play in the cultural domain, as tools to support some features of a digital library of cultural heritage. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The present work describes the architecture of an interactive audio guide (CART) specifically conceived for the Neapolitan Charterhouse “San Martino”, as part of a project, whose aim is to collect and model multimodal data for the development of spoken technologies for museum fruitions. In addition to the cultural contents that an audio-guide can provide, this application is enriched with a spoken dialogue system, a system interacting with humans by means of spoken language commands and requests. The application was developed using Android Studio. Furthermore, the developed interface for the Museum was endowed with dialogic skills modelled in DialogFlow using its Android Software Development Kit (SDK), to which Text-to-Speech technologies were integrated to record the user query. The results are promising in that they display positive feedback for the introduction of such technologies in museums. © 2019, Italian Association for Speech Sciences (AISV). All rights reserved.

AB  - This study falls into the bigger framework of the CHROME project, addressing the definition and testing of a methodology of collecting, analyzing and modeling multimodal data for the design of virtual agents serving in museums. The paper analyses three tourist guides’ speech, focusing on silent pauses and voiced pauses (filled pauses and segmental prolongations). In this regard, a description of phonetic-acoustic and functional features of pauses and a classification of concomitant gestures have been performed. Results show a) speakers’ idiosyncratic linguistic behaviours; b) a clear distinction between silent pauses, mainly used for grammatical and intentional reasons, and voiced pauses that instead occur as ungram-matical and hesitation devices; c) such a distinction is confirmed by concomitant gestures, they are semantically loaded in silent pauses and semantically empty in voiced pauses. © 2019, Italian Association for Speech Sciences (AISV).

AB  - Medical archives processing is a very important task in a medical information system. It generally consists of three steps: medical archives recognition, feature extraction and text classification. In this paper, we focus on empowering the medical archives processing with knowledge graphs. We first build a semantic-rich medical knowledge graph. Then, we recognize texts from medical archives using several popular optical character recognition (OCR) engines, and extract keywords from texts using a knowledge graph based feature extraction algorithm. Third, we define a semantic measure based on knowledge graph to evaluate the similarity between medical texts, and perform the text classification task. This measure can value semantic relatedness between medical documents, to enhance the text classification. We use medical archives collected from real hospitals for validation. The results show that our algorithms can significantly outperform typical baselines that employs only term statistics. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - The rich cultural heritage preserved in the Belliniano Civic Museum of Catania has been studied and promoted in the last years mainly thanks to the BellinInRete project. It includes collections of objects (or resources) of a very different nature: paintings, photos, pianos, autograph scores, manuscript leaves, books preserved in the Museum’s library, etc. In order to make the Belliniano Museum’s heritage interoperable and reusable by scholars and cultural operators, we propose to semantically organize it in a unique homogeneous container, the OntoBellini ontology, designed and developed according to the Linked Open Data and Semantic Web paradigms. The wide variety of the involved museum resources, not even fully digitalised and catalogued, led us to the idea of experimenting with the RDA (Resource Description and Access) standard for creating library and cultural heritage resource metadata. In this paper we describe the ongoing work towards the realization of the OntoBellini ontology. Copyright © 2019 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Image based-modeling practices in the field of Cultural Heritage studies are nowadays no longer seen as one-shot applications but as various and complex multimodal scenarios. Current use of SFM and photogrammetric methods implies their extensions to facilitate the management of complex multimodal data sets carried-out by different experts around a single heritage asset. In order to fully benefit of collaborative semantic enrichment of spatially oriented resources, a versatile and robust solution have been developed to enable incremental registration of image-sets within the web-based platform AIOLI. For this purpose, this paper will present an on-going development of a Totally Automated Co-registration and Orientations (TACO) work-flow. © Authors 2019.

AB  - The cultural heritage artifacts that have been collected in national museums serve as important resources for learning, and contribute to the country’s development. In this work, we present TOMS (Thailand Open Museum System), a semantic-based application designed to enable collaboration and the sharing of a wide range of information among national museums. This is accomplished by using linked open data (LOD) and an ontology model based on accepted museum ontology standards from the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC CRM). The system is composed of the following three layers: (1) Data Store Layer for maintaining each museum’s database including digital 3D content and standard metadata descriptions, represented in a standard distributed data format; (2) Data Manipulation and Processing Layer for handling data processing and query execution; and (3) System Interface Layer designed for each particular site, to exchange and integrate data with other sites in the network via an LOD SPARQL endpoint. The system operations have been demonstrated through case studies and an evaluation, showing that they are highly effective and useful for both national museums and museum users. © 2019, Ohmsha, Ltd. and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The Digital Archive of American Indian Languages Preservation and Perseverance (DAILP) is an innovative language revitalization project that seeks to provide digital infrastructure for the preservation and study of endangered languages among Native American speech communities. The project’s initial goal is to publish a digital collection of Cherokee-language documents to serve as the basis for language learning, cultural study, and linguistic research. Its primary texts derive from digitized manuscript images of historical Cherokee Syllabary texts, a written tradition that spans nearly two centuries. Of vital importance to DAILP is the participation and expertise of the Cherokee user community in processing such materials, specifically in Syllabary text transcription, romanization, and translation activities. To support the study and linguistic enrichment of such materials, the project is seeking to develop tools and services for the modeling, annotation, and sharing of DAILP texts and language data. © Jeffrey Bourns.

AB  - Recently, semantic data have become more distributed. Available datasets should serve non-technical as well as technical audience. This is also the case with our EVENTSKG dataset, a comprehensive knowledge graph about scientific events, which serves the entire scientific and library community. A common way to query such data is via SPARQL queries. Non-technical users, however, have difficulties with writing SPARQL queries, because it is a time-consuming and error-prone task, and it requires some expert knowledge. This opens the way to natural language interfaces to tackle this problem by making semantic data more accessible to a wider audience, i.e., not restricted to experts. In this work, we present SPARQL-AG, a human-Friendly front-end that automatically generates and executes SPARQL queries for querying EVENTSKG. SPARQL-AG helps potential semantic data consumers, including non-experts and experts, by generating SPARQL queries, ranging from simple to complex ones, using an interactive web interface. The eminent feature of SPARQL-AG is that users neither need to know the schema of the knowledge graph being queried nor to learn the SPARQL syntax, as SPARQL-AG offers them a familiar and intuitive interface for query generation and execution. It maintains separate clients to query three public SPARQL endpoints when asking for particular entities. The service is publicly available online and has been extensively tested. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Q&A sites for developers (like Stack Overflow) provide various types of game-specific social contents that can support the development of effective serious games – games that can really train, educate, and motivate players. These social contents include valuable information for effective serious games development, such as design principles and best practices, game-specific algorithms, game engines, API documentation and game libraries. However, existing techniques and tools for analysing social contents are mainly focusing on recognizing person, location, and organization, and thus are not designed to support the recent advance of entity-centric search systems, such as direct answers and knowledge-graph for serious games domain. In this research, we study the problem of NER to support the development of serious games. We address the challenges of recognizing game-specific named entities in social contents and develop a machine-learning based model that can recognize a broad category of named entities that game developers really care about. We conduct systematic experiments to evaluate our machine learning-based NER against a well-designed rule-based baseline system and to study the effectiveness of various NER techniques and features against the unique challenges of game-specific social contents. © The Authors, 2019.

AB  - In this paper, we describe our research activities for integrating the recommendation process of nearby points of artistic and cultural interest (POIs) with related multimedia content. The recommendation engine exploits the potential offered by linked open data (LOD), by following semantic links in the LOD graph to identify movies, books, and music artists/songs related to that specific POI. This content is subsequently reranked based on the activity of the user and her friends on social media (i.e., Facebook), in order to provide personalized suggestions. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - This paper presents a new knowledge-based approach for finding serendipitous semantic relations between resources in a knowledge graph. The idea is to characterize the notion of “interesting connection” in terms of generic ontological explanation patterns that are applied to an underlying linked data repository to instantiate connections. In this way, 1) semantically uninteresting connections can be ruled out effectively, and 2) natural language explanations about the connections can be created for the end-user. The idea has been implemented and tested based on a knowledge graph of biographical data extracted from the biographies of 13 000 prominent historical persons in Finland, enriched by data linking to collection databases of museums, libraries, and archives. The demonstrator is in use as part of the BiographySampo portal of interlinked biographies. © 2019 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Like every other social sphere, science is influenced by individual characteristics of researchers. However, for investigations on scientific networks, only little data about the social background of researchers, e.g. social origin, gender, affiliation etc., is available. This paper introduces”Take it personally - TIP”, a conceptual model and library currently under development, which aims to support the semantic enrichment of publication databases with semantically related background information which resides elsewhere in the (semantic) web, such as Wikidata. The supplementary information enriches the original information in the publication databases and thus facilitates the creation of complex scientific knowledge graphs. Such enrichment helps to improve the scientometric analysis of scientific publications as they can also take social backgrounds of researchers into account and to understand social structure in research communities.

AB  - Digital Scholarly Editions (DSE) are a powerful tool for disseminating cultural heritage. As long as Semantic Web technologies become a de facto standard for disseminating cultural heritage data, DSE are a missing bit that must be integrated in the LOD Cloud. Despite a number of standards are in place for exchanging data about encoded texts (XML/TEI, noSQL database, RESTful API), a number of key elements are missing, namely: (1) a comprehensive workflow for publishing DSE as knowledge graphs, (2) data models for identifying concepts and relationships characterising DSE, and (3) a cost-benefit analysis of the usage of such technologies. In this paper we present the proof-of-concept DSE of Paolo Bufalini's notebook so as to address, discuss, and evaluate the aforementioned issues. © 2019, University of Bologna Department of Classical and Italian Philology, Alma Mater Studiorum.

AB  - Several semantic web approaches tackle the problem of integrating multidisciplinary rich content using Linked Open Data. Cultural heritage (CH) is a multidisciplinary domain that contains a massive heterogeneous content that varies distinctly by types and properties. Various semantic web approaches have been proposed in the context of CH, and at multiple integration levels (local, national, international). These approaches focus on metadata schemata integration but give no significant importance to the representation of a tangible cultural heritage object, as a whole entity, and the different parts that compose it. Targeting the goal of the preservation and restoration of CH artifacts, we aim at modeling the CH content focusing on the composition of a CH object. We thus illustrate here an approach of using a part-whole and spatial relations to model the composition of a tangible object in general, and a CH object in particular. To do this, we introduce parthood concepts and properties for representing the composition mechanism, and 7 cases of parthood/spatial relations in tangible objects, with their corresponding logical/ontological relation(s). We implement our approach using OWL2 as the ontological language for our linked open data approach. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Over the past decade, vast amounts of machine-readable structured information has become available through the automation of research processes as well as the increasing popularity of knowledge graphs and semantic technologies. A major and yet unsolved challenge that research faces today is to perform scalable analysis of large scale knowledge graphs in order to facilitate applications like link prediction, knowledge base completion and question answering. Most machine learning approaches, which scale horizontally (i.e. can be executed in a distributed environment) work on simpler feature vector based input rather than more expressive knowledge structures. On the other hand, the learning methods which exploit the expressive structures, e.g. Statistical Relational Learning and Inductive Logic Programming approaches, usually do not scale well to very large knowledge bases owing to their working complexity. This paper describes the ongoing project Semantic Analytics Stack (SANSA) which aims to bridge this research gap by creating an out of the box library for scalable, in-memory, structured learning. © 2019 Universitatsverlag Potsdam.

AB  - The Notarial Archives in Valletta, the capital city of Malta, houses a rich and valuable collection of around twenty thousand notarial manuscripts dating back to the 15th century. The Archive wants to make the contents of this collection easily accessible and searchable to researchers and the general public. Knowledge Graphs have been successfully used to represent similar historical content. Nevertheless, building a Knowledge Graph for the archives is challenging as these documents are written in medieval Latin and currently there is a lack of information extraction tools that recognise this language. This is, furthermore, compounded with a lack of medieval Latin corpora to train and evaluate machine learning algorithms, as well as a lack of an ontological representation for the contents of notarial manuscripts. In this paper, we present NotaryPedia, a Knowledge Graph for the Notarial Archives. We extend our previous work on entity and keyphrase extraction with relation extraction to populate the Knowledge Graph using an ontological vocabulary for notarial deeds. Furthermore, we perform Knowledge Graph completeness using link-prediction and inference. Our work was evaluated using different translational distance and semantic matching models to predict relations amongst literals by promoting them to entities and to infer new knowledge from existing entities. A 49% relation prediction accuracy using TransE was achieved. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - "A picture is worth a thousand words": a famous quote about knowledge dissemination but also literally true. The documentation of cultural heritage (CH) monuments is carried out by measurements and photos and stored in 3d models - not by textual information alone. So what could be a more straightforward way to inform the public about CH than visual information? This approach can be extended not only by providing static images or videos from predefined angles but by giving the user the opportunity to interactively explore the virtual representation and interact with the scene. Recent advances in contemporary Virtual Reality (VR) have made it available to more people as prices have dropped. New devices have entered the market so that VR is not limited to VR labs, but is available even at home. With modern head-mounted displays the user can immerse himself in the virtual CH monument to explore and interact with it. Game engines offer tools for rapid development of interactions and help to produce visually appealing worlds.In this paper is presented the generation of a virtual 3D model of Rumeli Hisarl, an Ottoman fortress at the Bosporus in Istanbul, Turkey (Fig. 1) and its processing for data integration into the game engine Unity. The project has been carried out as a co-operation between BIMTAŞ, a company of the Greater Municipality of Istanbul, Turkey and the Photogrammetry & Laser Scanning Lab of the HafenCity University Hamburg, Germany with the aim of a VR application for an immersive and interactive visualisation of the fortress using the VR system HTC Vive. The workflow from data acquisition to VR visualisation, including the necessary programming for navigation, is described. Furthermore, the possible use (including simultaneous multiple users environments) of such a VR visualisation for a CH monument is discussed. © Authors 2019.

AB  - In this article, we describe a hybrid recommender system (RS) in the artistic and cultural heritage area, which takes into account the activities on social media performed by the target user and her friends, and takes advantage of linked open data (LOD) sources. Concretely, the proposed RS (1) extracts information from Facebook by analyzing content generated by users and their friends; (2) performs disambiguation tasks through LOD tools; (3) profiles the active user as a social graph; (4) provides her with personalized suggestions of artistic and cultural resources in the surroundings of the user’s current location. The last point is performed by integrating collaborative filtering algorithms with semantic technologies in order to leverage LOD sources such as DBpedia and Europeana. Based on the recommended points of cultural interest, the proposed system is also able to suggest to the active user itineraries among them, which meet her preferences and needs and are sensitive to her physical and social contexts as well. Experimental results on real users showed the effectiveness of the different modules of the proposed recommender. © Springer Nature B.V. 2019.

AB  - This paper takes the creation of knowledge graph of the Hundred Schools of Thought an example to discuss the application value and realization path of knowledge graph in knowledge organization of digital humanities. We have formed the idea of establishing the knowledge graph of the Hundred Schools of Thought, which consists of four steps: knowledge representation, knowledge extraction, knowledge storage, semantic search and knowledge visualization. At present, this paper has completed the ontology construction of Confucius, Laozi and Mozi, which are the three core figures of the Hundred Schools of Thought. This knowledge graph will be further realized by using web crawler and neo4j. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Named entity recognition (NER) plays an important role in many information retrieval tasks, including automatic knowledge graph construction. Most NER systems are typically limited to a few common named entity types, such as person, location, and organization. However, for cultural heritage resources, such as art historical archives, the recognition of titles of artworks as named entities is of high importance. In this work, we focus on identifying mentions of artworks, e.g. paintings and sculptures, from historical archives. Current state of the art NER tools are unable to adequately identify artwork titles due to the particular difficulties presented by this domain. The scarcity of training data for NER for cultural heritage poses further hindrances. To mitigate this, we propose a semi-supervised approach to create high-quality training data by leveraging existing cultural heritage resources. Our experimental evaluation shows significant improvement in NER performance for artwork titles as compared to baseline approach. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - The trends of open science have enabled several open scholarly datasets which include millions of papers and authors. Managing, exploring, and utilizing such large and complicated datasets effectively are challenging. In recent years, the knowledge graph has emerged as a universal data format for representing knowledge about heterogeneous entities and their relationships. The knowledge graph can be modeled by knowledge graph embedding methods, which represent entities and relations as embedding vectors in semantic space, then model the interactions between these embedding vectors. However, the semantic structures in the knowledge graph embedding space are not well-studied, thus knowledge graph embedding methods are usually only used for knowledge graph completion but not data representation and analysis. In this paper, we propose to analyze these semantic structures based on the well-studied word embedding space and use them to support data exploration. We also define the semantic queries, which are algebraic operations between the embedding vectors in the knowledge graph embedding space, to solve queries such as similarity and analogy between the entities on the original datasets. We then design a general framework for data exploration by semantic queries and discuss the solution to some traditional scholarly data exploration tasks. We also propose some new interesting tasks that can be solved based on the uncanny semantic structures of the embedding space. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - The digitization within all cultural areas imposes its requirements on the collection, preservation and visualization of cultural and historical heritage data. It offers new forms of analysis, and increased levels of access for academics and ordinary users. Beyond standard search-oriented interfaces, modern technologies provide visual access to cultural collections represented as complex and comprehensive information spaces through interactive visualizations. This article reviews the types of technology used to visualize and socialize the cultural and historical heritage. It offers various models in which semantic network visualization software can be used for this purpose. The main features and qualities of semantic networks are highlighted as a resource for storing information, and systematizing data from different application areas. © UIKTEN - Association for Information Communication Technology Education and Science.

AB  - In recent years, the history of automatic computing devices and associated technologies has attracted more and more interest. The area is quite peculiar, very complex, very young, and involves rapid obsolescence. So, research practices and tools for handling it from a cultural heritage perspective are still immature. Still missing, and urgently needed, is an ontology that categorizes and systematizes the concepts of interest. Also, there is a pressing need to collect, preserve and make available precious knowledge that is at risk of going lost. It is currently scattered across many people spread all over the world. As a contribution to this area of research, this paper proposes: an ontology for computing devices and their history, the first version of a knowledge graph for this field, and GraphBRAIN, a general-purpose tool to design and collaboratively populate knowledge graphs, that also provides advanced consultation and analysis tools. It may be used as an intermediate layer to provide services to end-user applications aimed at personalized fruition of cultural heritage, also in a touristic perspective.

AB  - Interdisciplinary collaborations and data sharing are essential to addressing the long history of human-environmental interactions underlying the modern biodiversity crisis. Such collaborations are increasingly facilitated by, and dependent upon, sharing open access data from a variety of disciplinary communities and data sources, including those within biology, paleontology, and archaeology. Significant advances in biodiversity open data sharing have focused on neontological and paleontological specimen records, making available over a billion records through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. But to date, less effort has been placed on the integration of important archaeological sources of biodiversity, such as zooarchaeological specimens. Zooarchaeological specimens are rich with both biological and cultural heritage data documenting nearly all phases of human interaction with animals and the surrounding environment through time, filling a critical gap between paleontological and neontological sources of data within biodiversity networks. Here we describe technical advances for mobilizing zooarchaeological specimen-specific biological and cultural data. In particular, we demonstrate adaptations in the workflow used by biodiversity publisher VertNet to mobilize Darwin Core formatted zooarchaeological data to the GBIF network. We also show how a linked open data approach can be used to connect existing biodiversity publishing mechanisms with archaeoinformatics publishing mechanisms through collaboration with the Open Context platform. Examples of ZooArchNet published datasets are used to show the efficacy of creating this critically needed bridge between biological and archaeological sources of open access data. These technical advances and efforts to support data publication are placed in the larger context of ZooarchNet, a new project meant to build community around new approaches to interconnect zoorchaeological data and knowledge across disciplines. © 2019 LeFebvre et al.

AB  - The popularity of knowledge graphs has led to the development of techniques to refine them and increase their quality. One of the main refinement tasks is completion (also known as link prediction for knowledge graphs), which seeks to add missing triples to the graph, usually by classifying potential ones as true or false. While there is a wide variety of graph completion techniques, there is no standard evaluation setup, so each proposal is evaluated using different datasets and metrics. In this paper we present AYNEC, a suite for the evaluation of knowledge graph completion techniques that covers the entire evaluation workflow. It includes a customisable tool for the generation of datasets with multiple variation points related to the preprocessing of graphs, the splitting into training and testing examples, and the generation of negative examples. AYNEC also provides a visual summary of the graph and the optional exportation of the datasets in an open format for their visualisation. We use AYNEC to generate a library of datasets ready to use for evaluation purposes based on several popular knowledge graphs. Finally, it includes a tool that computes relevant metrics and uses significance tests to compare each pair of techniques. These open source tools, along with the datasets, are freely available to the research community and will be maintained. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Source code summaries are concise representations, in form of text and/or code, of complex code elements and are meant to help developers gain a quick understanding that in turns help them perform specific tasks. Generation of summaries that are task-specific is still a challenge in the automatic code summarization field. We propose an approach for generating on-demand, extrinsic hybrid summaries for API classes, relevant to a programming task, formulated as a natural language query. The summaries include the most relevant sentences extracted from the API reference documentation and the most relevant methods. External evaluators assessed the summaries generated for classes retrieved from JDK and Android libraries for several programming tasks. The majority found that the summaries are complete, concise, and readable. A comparison with summaries produce by three baseline approaches revealed that the information present only in our summaries is more relevant than the one present only in the baselines summaries. Finally, an extrinsic evaluation study showed that the summaries help the users evaluating the correctness of API retrieval results, faster and more accurately. © 2019 ACM.

AB  - The Netwerk Digitaal Erfgoed is a Dutch partnership that focuses on improving the visibility, usability and sustainability of digital collections in the cultural heritage sector. The vision is to improve the usability of the data by surmounting the borders between the separate collections of the cultural heritage institutions. Key concepts in this vision are the alignment of the data by using shared descriptions (e.g. thesauri), and the publication of the data as Linked Open Data. This demo paper describes a Proof of Concept to test this vision. It uses a register, where only summaries of datasets are stored, instead of all the data. Based on these summaries, a portal can query the register to find what data sources might be of interest, and then query the data directly from the relevant data sources.

AB  - This article responds to the widespread and oft-noted challenges digital humanists face in working with data that is uncertain and characterised by complex narratives. Using an example drawn from the vast archives of postwar interviews with Holocaust survivors, it draws on approaches developed in Qualitative Spatial Representation (QSR) to explore how two key spatial aspects of survivor's narratives - their uncertain wartime trajectories and the slippage in scales as these are retold - can be represented. Spatial information in narratives tends to not provide the exact coordinates necessary to store the information in geospatial databases. Instead, narratives rely much more on often less precise qualitative spatial relations such as 'near', 'next to', 'at the corner of' without precise geometric interpretations. Given that relational databases are ill-equipped to store this kind of relational spatial knowledge from natural language sources, the article argues for a need for digital humanists to return to first principles and reconsider database design. Descriptive triple-based graph representations, which have been devised to accommodate this kind of highly irregular, semi-structured relational knowledge, have the potential to work with, rather than against, the grain of the narrative sources that underlie the work of much of the digital humanities. © Edinburgh University Press 2019

AB  - In this paper we describe an Ontology Design Pattern for modeling events that recur regularly over time and share some invariant factors, which unify them conceptually. The proposed pattern appears to be foundational, since it models the top-level domain-independent concept of recurrence, as applied to a series of events: we refer to this type of events as recurrent event series. The pattern relies on existing patterns, i.e. Collection, Situation, Classification, Sequence. Indeed, a recurrent event is represented as both a collection of events and a situation in which these events are contextualized and unified according to one or more properties that are peculiar to each event, and occur at regular intervals. We show how this pattern has been used in the context of ArCo, the Knowledge Graph of Italian cultural heritage, in order to model recurrent cultural events, festivals, ceremonies.

AB  - With the advancement in semantic technologies, structured data in different domains is being modelled as knowledge graphs. Bibliographic information has proven rather acquiescent to being formalized as knowledge graphs or information networks. In this paper, we address the problem of retrieving related resources in a bibliographic information network like SciGraph. Discovery of path patterns representing a set of example pairs of related resources forms the basis of our solution. We have adopted a bi-directional search strategy to accommodate state-of-the-art similarity measure (viz. HeteSim), relevant to Heterogeneous Information Networks (HIN). The proposed method has been evaluated based on precision and execution time. On experimenting with different datasets (YAGO and Springer Nature SciGraph), we observe an improvement in performance, compared to forward search algorithm, which is based on Path Constrained Random Walk similarity measure. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Point cloud is widely used in various applications like 3D geographical information system (GIS), cultural heritage preservation, urban planning, etc. Most of these applications require interactive visualization of massive point cloud, which is challenging since their sizes are usually very large. This paper presents a method to construct a hierarchical data structure for point cloud data organization and real-time rendering, with an emphasis on speeding up the construction processing. The overall pipeline consists of the following three steps: first, the spatial extent of the whole dataset is divided into nested blocks; second, data in each block is reorganized using a octree based on random subsampling in a parallel fashion; finally, octree of all blocks are merged into a consistent hierarchy. The effectiveness and efficiency of the above approach was demonstrated by applying it to a set of point clouds of varying sizes reconstructed using photogrammetry pipeline. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - With the rapid development of digital humanities, some digital humanities platforms have been successfully developed to support digital humanities research for humanists. However, most of them have still not provided a friendly digital reading environment and practicable digital humanities analysis tools to support humanists on interpreting texts and exploring characters' social network relationship. Moreover, the advancement of digitization technologies for the retrieval and use of Chinese ancient books is arising an unprecedented challenge and opportunity due to the development of international Chinese study. For these reasons, this paper presents a Chinese ancient books digital humanities research platform (CABDHRP) to support historical Chinese studies. In addition to providing digital archives, digital reading, basic search, and advanced search functions for Chinese ancient books, this platform still provides two novel functions that can more effectively support digital humanities research including an automatic text annotation system (ATAS) for interpreting texts and a character social network relationship map tool (CSNRMT) which can show the character relationships as a knowledge graph with triples containing two character names and their corresponding relationship attribute for exploring characters' social network relationships. This study adopted DSpace, an open-source institutional repository system, to serve as a digital archives system for archiving scanned images, metadata, and full texts to develop the CABDHRP for supporting digital humanities research. To understand the research participants' perception when interpreting the historical texts and character social network relationships with the support of ATAS and CSNRMT, the semi-structured interviews with 21 research participants were preceded. An automatic text annotation system (ATAS) embedded in the reading interface of CABDHRP can collect resources from different databases through linked data (LD) for automatically annotating ancient texts to support digital humanities research. Additionally, the CSNRMT provided by the CABDHRP can semi-automatically identify characters' names based on Chinese word segmentation technology and humanists' support to confirm and analyze characters' social network relationships from Chinese ancient books based on visualizing characters' social networks as a knowledge graph. The CABDHRP not only can stimulate humanists to explore new viewpoints in a humanistic research, but also can promote the public to emerge the learning interest and awareness of Chinese ancient books. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - MIRELA is a virtual environment for researchers interested in exploring various aspects of traditional music. The environment has been designed by DARIAH-PL Music Information Retrieval Working Group with the objective to offer researchers extended support in storage and management of traditional music data collections, their processing, analysis and visualisation as well as publishing of the corresponding results. The paper describes a prototype content repository that has been set up with dLibra, a multimedia digital library software developed by Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center (PSNC) adapted for musical content and the metadata schema provided by the Institute of Art of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IAPAS). As a proof of concept, the repository was tested with a set of musical samples and related multimodal data from the IAPAS' digitized phonographic archives of Polish traditional music. The paper also describes new content-based music processing modules: WebEsAC and SoundScribe. WebEsAC has been developed for processing melodies encoded in symbolic music representation defined by the EsAC format. SoundScribe implements the pYIN algorithm for extracting the predominant melody from a monophonic recording and converting it into MIDI and symbolic music notation. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - In the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry stakeholders from different companies and backgrounds collaborate in realising a common goal being some physical structure. The exact goal is typically not known from the beginning, and throughout all design stages, new decisions are made - similarly to other design industries [1]. As a result, the design must adapt and subsequent consequences follow. With working methods being predominantly document-centric, highly interrelated and rapidly changing design data in a complex network of decisions, requirements and product specifications is primarily captured in static documents. In this paper, we consider a purely data-driven approach based on semantic web technologies and an earlier proposed Ontology for Property Management (OPM). The main contribution of this work consists of extensions for OPM to account for new competency questions including the description of property reliability and the reasoning logic behind derived properties. The secondary contribution is the specification of a homogeneous way to generate parametric queries for managing an OPM-compliant AEC Knowledge Graph (AEC-KG). A software library for operating an OPM-compliant AEC-KG is further presented in the form of an OPM Query Generator (OPM-QG). The library generates SPARQL 1.1 queries to query and manipulate construction project Knowledge Graphs represented using OPM. The OPM ontology aligns with latest developments in the W3C Community Group on Linked Building Data and suggests an approach to working with design data in a distributed environment using separate graphs for explicit facts and for materialised, deduced data. Finally, we evaluate the suggested approach using an open-source software artefact developed using OPM and OPM-QG, demonstrated online with an actual building Knowledge Graph. The particular design task evaluated is performing heat loss calculations for spaces of a future building using an AEC-KG described using domain- and project specific extensions of the Building Topology Ontology (BOT) in combination with OPM. With this work, we demonstrate how a typical engineering task can be accomplished and managed in an evolving design environment, thereby providing the engineers with insights to support decision making as changes occur. The application uses a strict division between the client viewer and the actual data model holding design logic, and can easily be extended to support other design tasks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The rail transit Codes contain a large number of schemaless data and text, which are difficult to extract and process. Knowledge Graph can handle large-scale schemaless data, thus it is used to effectively store and manipulate relevant information of rail transit Codes. As an essential component, Chinese word segmentation is a difficult problem for building the Knowledge Graph of rail transit Codes. In this paper, we propose a bi-directional maximum matching algorithm and some rules based Chinese word segmentation method, for design Codes of rail transit. In the proposed method, the item information, attribute values and Code names are first segmented by preprocessing. Then, the bidirectional matching algorithm with double dictionary is used to generate the preliminary results. Finally, the preliminary results are further optimized with rules to generate the final results. With testing some design Codes, the experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the accuracy and efficiency of Chinese word segmentation in this field, and it can deal with the update of noun entity library. © 2019 IEEE.

In this paper, we present a workflow and system designed to, among other things, compare research contributions in a scientific knowledge graph. In order to compare contributions, multiple tasks are performed, including finding similar contributions, mapping properties and visualizing the comparison. The presented workflow is implemented in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) which enables researchers to find and compare related literature. A preliminary evaluation has been conducted with researchers. Results show that researchers are satisfied with the usability of the user interface, but more importantly, they acknowledge the need and usefulness of contribution comparisons.

AB  - This paper argues for making a paradigm shift in publishing and using biographical dictionaries on the web, based on Linked Data. The idea is to provide the user with enhanced reading experience of biographies by enriching contents with data linking and reasoning. In addition, versatile tooling for (1) biographical research of individual persons as well as for (2) prosopographical research on groups of people are provided. To demonstrate and evaluate the new possibilities, we present the semantic portal “BiographySampo – Finnish Biographies on the Semantic Web”. The system is based on a knowledge graph extracted automatically from a collection of 13 100 textual biographies, enriched with data linking to 16 external data sources, and by harvesting external collection data from libraries, museums, and archives. The portal was released in September 2018 for free public use at http://biografiasampo.fi. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - A key challenge in cultural heritage (CH) sites visualization is to provide models and tools that effectively integrate the content of a CH data with domain-specific knowledge so that the users can query, interpret and consume the visualized information. Moreover, it is important that the intelligent visualization systems are interoperable in the semantic web environment and thus, capable of establishing a methodology to acquire, integrate, analyze, generate and share numeric contents and associated knowledge in human and machine-readable Web. In this paper, we present a model, a methodology and a software Web-tools that support the coupling of the 2D/3D Web representation with the knowledge graph database of Xlendi shipwreck. The Web visualization tools and the knowledge-based techniques are married into a photogrammetry driven ontological model while at the same time, user-friendly web tools for querying and semantic consumption of the shipwreck information are introduced. © 2019 Copernicus GmbH.

AB  - The National Diet Library, Japan (NDL), with support by Xenon Limited Partners, has designed a new metadata schema based on the RDF model while developing a national platform for metadata aggregation and sharing, “Japan Search”. Japan Search collects metadata from libraries, museums, archives, and research institutions across the country, and provides an integrated search service as well as APIs (SPARQL Endpoint and REST-API). The aim of this paper is to introduce the new schema, highlighting its dual-layered data model and the normalization of temporal (When), spatial (Where), and agential (Who) information provided in the source data. © 2019 Dublin Core metadata initiative.

AB  - Purpose: Big Data introduces high amounts and new forms of structured, unstructured and semi-structured data into the field of accounting and this requires alternative data management and reporting methods. Generating insights from these new data sources highlight the need for different and interactive forms of visualization in the field of visual analytics. Nonetheless, a considerable gap between the recommendations in research and the current usage in practice is evident. In order to understand and overcome this gap, a detailed analysis of the status quo as well as the identification of potential barriers for adoption is vital. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: A survey with 145 business accountants from Austrian companies from a wide array of business sectors and all hierarchy levels has been conducted. The survey is targeted toward the purpose of this study: identifying barriers, clustered as human-related and technological-related, as well as investigating current practice with respect to interactive visualization use for Big Data. Findings: The lack of knowledge and experience regarding new visualization types and interaction techniques and the sole focus on Microsoft Excel as a visualization tool can be identified as the main barriers, while the use of multiple data sources and the gradual implementation of further software tools determine the first drivers of adoption. Research limitations/implications: Due to the data collection with a standardized survey, there was no possibility of dealing with participants individually, which could lead to a misinterpretation of the given answers. Further, the sample population is Austrian, which might cause issues in terms of generalizing results to other geographical or cultural heritages. Practical implications: The study shows that those knowledgeable and familiar with interactive Big Data visualizations indicate high perceived ease of use. It is, therefore, necessary to offer sufficient training as well as user-centered visualizations and technological support to further increase usage within the accounting profession. Originality/value: A lot of research has been dedicated to the introduction of novel forms of interactive visualizations. However, little focus has been laid on the impact of these new tools for Big Data from a practitioner’s perspective and their needs. © 2019, Lisa Maria Perkhofer, Peter Hofer, Conny Walchshofer, Thomas Plank and Hans-Christian Jetter.

AB  - [Question] The construction of cultural knowledge base in digital library is in progress with the development of information technology. However, traditional cultural knowledge bases are facing the problems of high participation of manual operation and monotonous data source. This paper combines knowledge graph, a frontier technology of artificial intelligence, to explore a new method of building high-quality, automated cultural knowledge base. [Method] Using the experimental method, we selected the knowledge of the Hundred Schools of Thought in ancient China. Because these knowledges are clearly interrelated, it is suitable to construct the knowledge graph of them. The knowledge graph can provide experience for the construction of other cultural knowledge bases. [Conclusion] At present, this paper has preliminarily completed the experimental design of the knowledge graph of the Hundred Schools of Thought, and provided the flowchart of the construction of cultural domain knowledge graph.

AB  - Despite improved digital access to scholarly literature in the last decades, the fundamental principles of scholarly communication remain unchanged and continue to be largely document-based. Scholarly knowledge remains locked in representations that are inadequate for machine processing. The Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) is an infrastructure for representing, curating and exploring scholarly knowledge in a machine actionable manner. We demonstrate the core functionality of ORKG for representing research contributions published in scholarly articles. A video of the demonstration [7] and the system (https://labs.tib.eu/orkg/ ) are available online. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - This paper discusses a shift of focus in research on Cultural Heritage semantic portals, based on Linked Data, and envisions and proposes new directions of research. Three generations of portals are identified: Ten years ago the research focus in semantic portal development was on data harmonization, aggregation, search, and browsing ('first generation systems'). At the moment, the rise of Digital Humanities research has started to shift the focus to providing the user with integrated tools for solving research problems in interactive ways ('second generation systems'). This paper envisions and argues that the next step ahead to 'third generation systems' is based on Artificial Intelligence: future portals not only provide tools for the human to solve problems but are used for finding research problems in the first place, for addressing them, and even for solving them automatically under the constraints set by the human researcher. Such systems should preferably be able to explain their reasoning, which is an important aspect in the source critical humanities research tradition. The second and third generation systems set new challenges for both computer scientists and humanities researchers. © 2020-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - Both, historical as well as contemporary images depicting particular aspects of a certain culture, or a certain cultural practice, are widely available in a variety of formats. Typically, historical-cultural images can be found in museums, national archives and libraries both in analogue and digital formats. The Europeana image collection serves as a valuable example of a digital image collection available to the public, that is freely accessible and searchable. A significant amount of the collection, however, does not contain a rich semantic description of the cultural and social aspects represented in the images that would go beyond some metadata like author and title. To enable the enrichment of these images, we propose a project which brings together experts from digital humanities, linguistics, artificial intelligence and semantic web technology. The project aims at analysing the contents of the images with a combination of computer vision, natural language processing and manual curation to represent them with a more descriptive and representative controlled vocabulary. This combination of different types of expertise to address the problem enables us to closely collaborate and learn from each other by taking different roles and perspectives. So far, the collaboration has contributed to the understanding of the detailed requirements from the digital humanities and socio-linguistic perspectives for the representation and processing of cultural images using semantic web technologies, such as multi-disciplinary thesauri, ontologies, computer vision and AI. © 2020 CEUR-WS.

AB  - This paper presents the state of the art of the cataloguing description of personal relationships between creators of archival records and people that are related to the life cycle of cultural objects, as highlighted by museums, archives and libraries records (i.e. GLAM, translated in italian MAB). Since people are fundamental access points to the cultural heritage, the representation of relationships between people and corporate bodies in Linked Open Data is of increasing interest. Nonetheless, a shared and comprehensive vocabulary of personal relationships is not available yet. Leveraging on Semantic Web technologies, and ontologies in particular, the aim is to identify existing ontologies that allow to represent relationships in their context (i.e. time, space and events); to map and classify different types of personal relationships; and to provide a formal representation of relationships not available in existing ontologies. As a result, we present an ontology, with a controlled vocabulary, for the representation of the scenario of personal relationships in the cultural heritage domain. © 2019, The Author(s).

VISE provides an interactive visual summary of information relating to the museum to address online users with no domain knowledge challenges of exploring large museum collection. User satisfaction evaluation was conducted to measure the user satisfaction level for using VISE as the interface for search and exploration of information from large museum collection when compared to non-visual search interface. The evaluation of the visual interface revealed that users are more satisfied and attracted to explore museum objects via VISE than via the system with no visual search interface. Users with little or no domain knowledge find it easier to explore collections and find objects of interest while using VISE in contrast to the system with no visual interface. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - In this work, we tackle the problem of generating comprehensive overviews of research findings in a structured and comparable way. To bring structure to such information and thus to enable researchers to, e.g., explore domain overviews, we present an approach for automatic unveiling of realm overviews for research artifacts (Aurora), an approach to generate overviews of research domains and their relevant artifacts. Aurora is a semi-automatic crowd-sourcing workflow that captures such information into the OpenResearch.org semantic wiki. Our evaluation confirms that Aurora, when compared to the current manual approach, reduces the effort for researchers to compile and read survey papers. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) have received significant attention in other domains due to their ability to predict links and create dense representations for graphs' nodes and edges. However, the software ecosystem for their application to bioinformatics remains limited and inaccessible for users without expertise in programing and machine learning. Therefore, we developed BioKEEN (Biological KnowlEdge EmbeddiNgs) and PyKEEN (Python KnowlEdge EmbeddiNgs) to facilitate their easy use through an interactive command line interface. Finally, we present a case study in which we used a novel biological pathway mapping resource to predict links that represent pathway crosstalks and hierarchies.

AB  - Purpose: With the rapid development of digital humanities, some digital humanities platforms have been successfully developed to support digital humanities research for humanists. However, most of them have still not provided a friendly digital reading environment and practicable social network analysis tool to support humanists on interpreting texts and exploring characters’ social network relationships. Moreover, the advancement of digitization technologies for the retrieval and use of Chinese ancient books is arising an unprecedented challenge and opportunity. For these reasons, this paper aims to present a Chinese ancient books digital humanities research platform (CABDHRP) to support historical China studies. In addition to providing digital archives, digital reading, basic search and advanced search functions for Chinese ancient books, this platform still provides two novel functions that can more effectively support digital humanities research, including an automatic text annotation system (ATAS) for interpreting texts and a character social network relationship map tool (CSNRMT) for exploring characters’ social network relationships. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted DSpace, an open-source institutional repository system, to serve as a digital archives system for archiving scanned images, metadata, and full texts to develop the CABDHRP for supporting digital humanities (DH) research. Moreover, the ATAS developed in the CABDHRP used the Node.js framework to implement the system’s front- and back-end services, as well as application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by different databases, such as China Biographical Database (CBDB) and TGAZ, used to retrieve the useful linked data (LD) sources for interpreting ancient texts. Also, Neo4j which is an open-source graph database management system was used to implement the CSNRMT of the CABDHRP. Finally, JavaScript and jQuery were applied to develop a monitoring program embedded in the CABDHRP to record the use processes from humanists based on xAPI (experience API). To understand the research participants’ perception when interpreting the historical texts and characters’ social network relationships with the support of ATAS and CSNRMT, semi-structured interviews with 21 research participants were conducted. Findings: An ATAS embedded in the reading interface of CABDHRP can collect resources from different databases through LD for automatically annotating ancient texts to support digital humanities research. It allows the humanists to refer to resources from diverse databases when interpreting ancient texts, as well as provides a friendly text annotation reader for humanists to interpret ancient text through reading. Additionally, the CSNRMT provided by the CABDHRP can semi-automatically identify characters’ names based on Chinese word segmentation technology and humanists’ support to confirm and analyze characters’ social network relationships from Chinese ancient books based on visualizing characters’ social networks as a knowledge graph. The CABDHRP not only can stimulate humanists to explore new viewpoints in a humanistic research, but also can promote the public to emerge the learning interest and awareness of Chinese ancient books. Originality/value: This study proposed a novel CABDHRP that provides the advanced features, including the automatic word segmentation of Chinese text, automatic Chinese text annotation, semi-automatic character social network analysis and user behavior analysis, that are different from other existed digital humanities platforms. Currently, there is no this kind of digital humanities platform developed for humanists to support digital humanities research. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Interactive visualization of spatio-temporal data is a very active area that has experienced remarkable advances in the last decade. This is due to the emergence of fields of research such as big data and advances in hardware that allow better analysis of information. This article describes the methodology followed and the design of an open source tool, which in addition to interactively visualizing spatio-temporal data that are represented in an ontology, allows the definition of what to visualize and how to do it. The tool allows selecting, filtering and visualizing in a graphical way the entities of the ontology with spatiotemporal data, as well as the instances related to them. The graphical elements used to display the information are specified on the same ontology, extending the VISO graphic ontology, used for mapping concepts to graphic objects with RDFS/OWL Visualization Language (RVL). This extension contemplates the data visualization on rich real-time 3D environments, allowing different modes of visualization according to the level of detail of the scene, while also emphasizing the treatment of spatio-temporal data, very often used in cultural heritage models. This visualization tool involves simple visualization scenarios and high interaction environments that allow complex comparative analysis. It combines traditional solutions, like hypercube or time-animation with innovative data selection methods. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - The turn toward the digital has opened up previously difficult to access musical materials to wider musicological scholarship. Digital repositories provide access to publicly licensed score images, score encodings, textual resources, audiovisual recordings, and music metadata. While each repository reveals rich information for scholarly investigation, the unified exploration and analysis of separate digital collections remains a challenge. TROMPA-Towards Richer Online Music Public-domain Archives-addresses this through a knowledge graph interweaving composers, performers, and works described in established digital music libraries, facilitating discovery and combined access of complementary materials across collections. TROMPA provides for contribution of expert insights as citable, provenanced annotations, supporting analytical workflows and scholarly communication. Beyond scholars, the project targets four further user types: instrumental players; choir singers; orchestras; and music enthusiasts; with corresponding web applications providing specialised views of the same underlying knowledge graph. Thus, scholars' annotations provide contextual information to other types of users; while performers' rehearsal recordings and performative annotations, conductors' marked up scores, and enthusiasts' social discussions and listening behaviours, become available to scholarly analysis (per user consent). The knowledge graph is exposed as Linked Data, adhering to the FAIR principles of making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable, and supporting further interlinking, re-interpretation and re-use beyond the immediate scope of the project. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The growing number of mobile augmented reality applications has been favoring its awareness and usage among diversified areas. Focusing on cultural heritage applications, this study presents an evaluation of a mobile augmented reality application tested at Conimbriga, an archaeological site. The prototype developed for this purpose, named DinofelisAR, allowed users to view, over 360 degrees, a majestic reconstruction of a Forum from the Roman Era superimposed over its current ruins. Thus, users were able to keep perceiving the present-day surroundings of a Roman city in ruins while, at the same time, had the possibility to explore the matching virtual model. The results presented, arising from 90 participants involved in this evaluation, praise the sense of opportunity for new augmented reality solutions targeted at cultural heritage sites. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Knowledge graph is a technique that uses computers to shore , manage, and present concepts and their relationships. This technique became a research hotspot in industry and academia as soon as it was proposed. However, the concept of knowledge graph was quite chaotic in this field. People often confuse Knowledge Map (KM), Knowledge Graph (KG) and Graph Database (GD). Knowledge map should be regarded more as a metrological method , so there is no detailed discussion in this paper. According to different storage methods the knowledge graph can be divided into semantic knowledge graph also called linked data , based on RDF storage), and generalized knowledge graph (due to graph databases). Linked data focuses on the release and linking of knowledge , while the generalized knowledge graph focuses more on the mining and calculation of knowledge. There are both commonalities and differences between the linked data and knowledge graph. This paper analyzes the similarities and differences between the two techniques from the conceptual and technical aspects and points out that the linked data is the continuation and development of Google's knowledge graph. In addition , this paper also proposes a system framework for applying knowledge graph to digital humanities research. Simultaneously , we also point out that digital generation , textual conversion , data extraction and intelligent construction are the main stages of research and development in the humanities field. Compared with most humanities research abroad in the textual stage , much humanities research in China are still in the digital stage , which is far from the research stage of smart data. Based on the theoretical basis of the study of smart data of digital humanities , this paper builds a linked data platform (CBDBLD) of Chinese Biographical Database (CBDB). The seven-step method adopted in the platform construction is representative and has been used in many digital humanities research projects , which can guide the semantic construction of domestic digital humanities research. This platform contains more than 420, 000 biographical data , about 22. 7 million triples , and is associated with open related datasets such as Shanghai Library Authority Name Files and VIAF (Virtual International Authority File). CBDBLD dataset contains ten categories of nearly 500 kinds of social relations. Further , this platform uses the concept of knowledge graph and visualization technology to show the rich relatives and social relations between characters. This platform forms a unique social network , and improves the dynamic interaction ability of user,s experience and platform. Knowledge computing and knowledge reasoning are the core technologies involved in the application of knowledge graph , which are widely studied in the application of generalized knowledge maps. However , little research has been done on linked data and digital humanities. Most of the digital humanities research in China uses linked data technology to publish and display metadata which can be regarded as the basis of knowledge graph application. Nevertheless it does not represent the whole knowledge graph research. In this paper the CBDBLD platform uses a general rule reasoner to support user-defined rule-based reasoning which implements the mining and presentation of implicit relationships between characters. Although the current reasoning is relatively simple it provides a new research direction for digital humanities research. The abundant graph mining and graph computing algorithms in the research of generalized knowledge atlas can be applied to the linked data , which is also the future research and practice direction of this paper's authors. It can be said that both semantic knowledge graph and generalized knowledge graph can promote the innovation of digital humanities research methods.

AB  - The World Wide Web is one of the main ways of accessing knowledge in cultural heritage. Recently, several projects in digital humanities have emerged; however only a few are specialized in musicology. In this paper, we present MusicKG, a multilingual knowledge graph about medieval musicology and musical iconography. A specific ontology has been designed to integrate data from several iconographic and musicology databases. In addition, MusicKG is connected to the Linked Open Data cloud with a significant part of its classes, properties and instances being linked to Wikidata, Getty Vocabularies, MIMO, Iconclass and GeoNames. MusicKG is accessible and reusable by three means: a downloadable RDF dump, a Virtuoso faceted browser and a public SPARQL endpoint. Some representative SPARQL query examples are given to illustrate the scope of MusicKG and to show the potential impact on the research work in medieval musicology. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Graph-based data models allow for flexible data representation. In particular, semantic data based on RDF and OWL fuels use cases ranging from general knowledge graphs to domain specific knowledge in various technological or scientific domains. The flexibility of such approaches, however, makes programming with semantic data tedious and error-prone. In particular the logics-based data descriptions employed by OWL are problematic for existing error-detecting techniques, such as type systems. In this paper, we present DOTSpa, an advanced integration of semantic data into programming. We embed description logics, the logical foundations of OWL, into the type checking process of a statically typed programming language and provide typed data access through an embedding of the query language SPARQL. In addition, we demonstrate a concrete implementation of the approach, by extending the Scala programming language. We qualitatively compare programs using our approach to equivalent programs using a state-of-the-art library, in terms of how both frameworks aid users in the handling of typical failure scenarios. © Philipp Seifer, Martin Leinberger, Ralf Lämmel, and Steffen Staab.

AB  - Archives today are publishing their cultural heritage data on the Web for exploration. However, for archive novices the traditional archival structures often are not intuitive and difficult to understand, and thus challenges data access and consumption. To tackle this problem, Linked Stage Graph was developed, a knowledge graph (KG) on the foundation of historical data about the Stuttgart State Theater. The data was made available by the Baden-Württemberg State Archives for the Coding da Vinci hackathon. This demo paper contributes the KG, a SPARQL endpoint, named entity extraction and linking to existing authoritative KGs as well as a dedicated user interface for exploration.

AB  - Empirical and Traditional knowledge is part of the concept of intangible cultural heritage, which represents immaterial cultural heritage items such as facts, stories, and traditions that are part of local culture. However, this knowledge might be lost over time. Encouraging public participation to record empirical knowledge is a way to preserve the culture of a region and make it known to others. This paper presents a web system that aims to record and to preserve empirical knowledge data. To achieve this goal, the tool uses three combined approaches: (i) crowdsourcing calls oriented to content creation by visitors; (ii) collaborative curation among experts for selection, evaluation, and publication of content; and (iii) interconnection between user contributions and data already available in open repositories on the web (in LOD format). The tool was applied in the Botany domain to curate empirical and cultural data about medicinal plants, where experts from the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden evaluated it. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Cultural heritage sites, apart from being the tangible link to a country’s history and culture, actively contribute to the national economy, offering a foundation upon which cultural tourism can develop. This importance at the cultural and economic level, advocates for the need for preservation of cultural heritage sites for the future generations. To this end, advanced monitoring systems harnessing the power of sensors are deployed near the sites to collect data which can fuel systems and processes aimed at protection and preservation. In this paper we present the use of acoustic sensors for safeguarding cultural sites located in rural or urban areas, based on a novel data flow framework. We developed and deployed Wireless Acoustic Sensors Networks that record audio signals, which are transferred to a modular cloud platform to be processed using an efficient deep learning algorithm (f1-score: 0.838) to identify audio sources of interest for each site, taking into account the materials the assets are made of. The extracted information is presented exploiting the designed STORM Audio Signal ontology and then fused with spatiotemporal information using semantic rules. The results of this work give valuable insight to the cultural experts and are publicly available using the Linked Open Data format. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This paper describes the system architecture for generating the History of the Law developed for the Chilean National Library of Congress (BCN). The production system uses Semantic Web technologies, Akoma-Ntoso, and tools that automate the marking of plain text to XML, enriching and linking documents. These documents semantically annotated allow to develop specialized political and legislative services, and to extract knowledge for a Legal Knowledge Base for public use. We show the strategies used for the implementation of the automatic markupÂ tools, as well as describe the knowledge graph generated from semantic documents. Finally, we show the contrast between the time of document processing using semantic technologies versus manual tasks, and the lessons learnt in this process, installing a base for the replication of a technological model that allows the generation of useful services for diverse contexts. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to determine how information professionals in Scotland and in European national libraries perceive linked data (LD) as well as if and how they are implementing it. Design/methodology/approach: The authors applied four data collection techniques: a literature review, semi-structured interviews (n=15), online resources analysis (n=26) and an online survey (n=113). They used constant comparative analysis to identify perceived benefits and challenges of LD implementation, reasons behind adoption or non-adoption of LD and the issues hindering its implementation in libraries. Findings: Some projects demonstrate LD’s potential to augment the visibility and discoverability of library data, alongside with overcoming linguistic barriers, and supporting interoperability. However, a strong need remains to demonstrate the Semantic Web’s potential within libraries. Participants identified lack of expertise and lack of resources/time/staff as implementation barriers. Several other issues remain unsolved, such as licensing constraints, as well as difficulties with obtaining management buy-in for LD initiatives, even where open data are government-mandated. Practical implications: Information professionals and vendors should collaborate to develop tools for implementation. Advocacy through disseminating and reviewing successful implementations can help to solve practical difficulties and to obtain management buy-in. Originality/value: This is the first known study to present a multinational, comprehensive picture of library LD implementations and associated librarians’ perceptions of LD. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - At the Jewish History Museum and Holocaust History Center in Tucson, Arizona, photographs, text, and audio displays present Jewish histories alongside local histories of African-American, Latinx, and Native peoples–among others–in Southern Arizona, where Jews comprise only 2–3% of the population. In documenting our pedagogical tools for presenting these histories, we ask what forms of responsibility and context are necessary when engaging antisemitism and other forms of exclusion. What does it mean to present these histories and not romanticize or isolate them in the past, but instead instrumentalize them in order to prompt contemporary action? Weekly public talks and an education program that reach several thousand students a year employ antiracist pedagogical methodologies for facilitating difficult conversations inside the museum. This article will document our frameworks of discussion and lines of questioning prompted by our museum displays that actively thematize race and institutional forms of discrimination. © 2019, © 2019 Museum Education Roundtable.

AB  - This paper argues for making a paradigm shift in publishing and using biographical dictionaries on the Web, based on Linked Data. The idea is to represent biographical data in a harmonized, semantically interoperable form, which enables 1) data enrichment by aggregating linked content from complementary, distributed, and heterogeneous data sources, as well as by reasoning, and 2) development of intelligent services using machine “understandable” data. Based on the aggregated global knowledge graph, published in a SPARQL endpoint, tooling for 1) biographical research of individual persons as well as for 2) prosopographical research on groups of people can be provided. As a demonstration of these ideas, we discuss the new in-use linked data service and semantic portal BIOGRAPHYSAMPO - Finnish Biographies on the Semantic Web that quickly attracted thousands of end users on the Web. This semantic portal is based on a knowledge graph extracted automatically from a collection of 13 100 textual biographies, written by 980 scholars. The texts are enriched with data linking to 16 external data sources and by harvesting external collection data from libraries, museums, and archives. Reasoning is used for query expansion and for discovering serendipitous relations between entities, such as persons and places. Copyright © 2019 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Augmented Reality (AR) offers the possibility to enrich the real world with digital mediated content, increasing in this way the quality of many everyday experiences. While in some research areas such as cultural heritage, tourism, or medicine there is a strong technological investment, AR for game purposes struggles to become awidespread commercial application. In this article, a novel framework for AR kid games is proposed, already developed by the authors for other AR applications such as Cultural Heritage and Arts. In particular, the framework includes different layers such as the development of a series of AR kid puzzle games in an intermediate structure which can be used as a standard for different applications development, the development of a smart configuration tool, together with general guidelines and long-life usage tests and metrics. The proposed application is designed for augmenting the puzzle experience, but can be easily extended to other AR gaming applications. Once the user has assembled the real puzzle, AR functionality within the mobile application can be unlocked, bringing to life puzzle characters, creating a seamless game that merges AR interactions with the puzzle reality. The main goals and benefits of this framework can be seen in the development of a novel set of AR tests and metrics in the pre-release phase (in order to help the commercial launch and developers), and in the release phase by introducing the measures for long-life app optimization, usage tests and hint on final users together with a measure to design policy, providing a method for automatic testing of quality and popularity improvements. Moreover, smart configuration tools, as part of the general framework, enabling multi-app and eventually also multi-user development, have been proposed, facilitating the serialization of the applications. Results were obtained from a large-scale user test with about 4 million users on a set of eight gaming applications, providing the scientific community a workflow for implicit quantitative analysis in AR gaming. Different data analytics developed on the data collected by the framework prove that the proposed approach is affordable and reliable for long-life testing and optimization. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Museums all over the world store a large variety of digitized paintings and other works of art with significant historical value. Over time, these works of art deteriorate, making them lose their original splendour. For paintings, cracks and paint losses are the most prominent types of deterioration, mainly caused by environmental factors, such as fluctuations in temperature or humidity, improper storage conditions and even physical impacts. We propose a neural network architecture for the detection of crack patterns in paintings, using visual acquisitions from different modalities. The proposed architecture is composed of two neural network streams, one is a fully connected neural network while the other consists of a multiscale convolutional neural network. The convolutional neural network plays a leading role in the crack classification task, while the fully connected neural network plays an auxiliary role. To reduce the overall computational complexity of the proposed method, we use morphological filtering as a pre-processing step to safely exclude areas of the image that do not contain cracks and do not need further processing. We validate the proposed method on a multimodal visual dataset from the Ghent Altarpiece, a world famous polyptych by the Van Eyck brothers. The results show an encouraging performance of the proposed approach compared to traditional machine learning methods and the state-of-the-art Bayesian Conditional Tensor Factorization (BCTF) method for crack detection. © 2020 SPIE

AB  - We report preliminary results on the problem of efficient retrieval of evidences for knowledge graph (KG) facts from large document collections. KGs are rich repositories of human knowledge and real-world events. To verify and validate facts about entities, it is often required to spot their evidences in large news archives or on the Web. To do so, KG facts can be translated to their natural language equivalent by using surface forms. Naïvely, attempting to search for all combinations of the aliases in large document collections is a time-consuming solution. We show that by using a combination of inverted indexes over n-grams and skip-grams we can return evidences in the form of sentences for KG facts within seconds. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Cultural heritage institutions have recently begun to consider the benefits of sharing their collections using linked open data to disseminate and enrich their metadata. As datasets become very large, challenges appear, such as ingestion, management, querying and enrichment. Furthermore, each institution has particular features related to important aspects such as vocabularies and interoperability, which make it difficult to generalise this process and provide one-for-all solutions. In order to improve the user experience as regards information retrieval systems, researchers have identified that further refinements are required for the recognition and extraction of implicit relationships expressed in natural language. We introduce a framework for the enrichment and disambiguation of locations in text using open knowledge bases such as Wikidata and GeoNames. The framework has been successfully used to publish a dataset based on information from the Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes, thus illustrating how semantic enrichment can help information retrieval. The methods applied in order to automate the enrichment process, which build upon open source software components, are described herein. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The paper presents research in the field of cultural heritage preservation and conservation by means of up-to-date information technologies including semantic approach and sensor networks, in particular. The subject of study is an ontology-based complex automation of museum-specific processes for microclimate parameters control. We present analysis of cultural heritage preservation domain and detect advantages and disadvantages of approaches used nowadays. Existing security vulnerabilities of such class of the systems are presented, threat classification is provided. It is shown that existing security systems and platforms of information systems and knowledge bases, widely used nowadays, cannot not fulfill requirements to security of knowledge bases as a result of many affecting factors and features. The work focuses on both reasons to apply general model-based approach using sensor networks as well as general model-based approach to knowledge security as the only approach able to differentiate facts from inferred knowledge, thus, providing security of the system in general. A set of ontologies is provided for filling the gaps of existing approaches: domain ontology for formalization of museum entities and security ontology for formalization of museum security facilities and for knowledge graph-based inference restrictions depending on access level. Concepts related to network devices and the Internet of things and a new access level are introduced. An innovative Transit Traversal access lever allows for traversing the graph to a final node via other nodes with restricted access. A system based on the provided ontology integrated with Goscatalog enables modernization of climate control and exhibition organization processes as well as ensuring both museum internal security and security of integration with external organizations. © 2019, ITMO University.

AB  - The evolution of the high-quality 3D archaeological representations from niche products to integrated online media has not yet been completed. Digital archives of the field often lack multimodal data interoperability, user interaction and intelligibility. A web-based cultural heritage archive that compensates for these issues is presented in this paper. The multi-resolution 3D models constitute the core of the visualization on top of which supportive documentation data and multimedia content are spatial and logical connected. Our holistic approach focuses on the dynamic manipulation of the 3D scene through the development of advanced navigation mechanisms and information retrieval tools. Users parse the multi-modal content in a geo-referenced way through interactive annotation systems over cultural points of interest and automatic narrative tours. Multiple 3D and 2D viewpoints are enabled in real-time to support data inspection. The implementation exploits front-end programming languages, 3D graphic libraries and visualization frameworks to handle efficiently the asynchronous operations and preserve the initial assets' accuracy. The choice of Greece's Meteora, UNESCO world site, as a case study accounts for the platform's applicability to complex geometries and large-scale historical environments. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Close-Range Photogrammetry (CRP) and Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) are two of the most used image-based techniques when documenting and analyzing Cultural Heritage (CH) objects. Nevertheless, their potential impact in supporting study and analysis of conservation status of CH assets is reduced as they remain mostly applied and analyzed separately. This is mostly because we miss easy-to-use tools for of a spatial registration of multimodal data and features for joint visualisation gaps. The aim of this paper is to describe a complete framework for an effective data fusion and to present a user friendly viewer enabling the joint visual analysis of 2D/3D data and RTI images. This contribution is framed by the on-going implementation of automatic multimodal registration (3D, 2D RGB and RTI) into a collaborative web platform (AIOLI) enabling the management of hybrid representations through an intuitive visualization framework and also supporting semantic enrichment through spatialized 2D/3D annotations. © Authors 2019.

AB  - In recent years, the usability of interfaces in the field of Virtual Realities (VR) has massively improved, so that theories and applications of multimodal data processing can now be tested more extensively. In this paper we present an extension of VAnnotatoR, which is a VR-based open hypermedia system that is used for annotating, visualizing and interacting with multimodal data. We extend VAnnotatoR by a module for gestural writing that uses data gloves as an interface for VR. Our extension addresses the application scenario of WikiNect, a museum information system, and its gesture palette for realizing gestural writing. To this end, we implement and evaluate seven gestures. The paper describes the training and recognition of these gestures and their use within the framework of a user-centered evaluation system for virtual museums as exemplified by WikiNect. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - is article describes a recommender system (RS) in the cultural heritage area, which takes into account the activities on social media performed by the target user and her friends. For this purpose, the system exploits linked open data (LOD) as well. More specifically, the proposed RS (i) extracts information from social networks (e.g., Facebook) by analyzing content generated by users and those included in their social networks; (ii) performs disambiguation tasks through LOD tools; (iii) profiles the user as a social graph; (iv) provides the actual user with personalized suggestions of artistic and cultural resources by integrating collaborative €ltering algorithms with semantic technologies for leveraging LOD sources such as DBpedia and Europeana. © 2017 ACM.

AB  - The Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM) sector deals with complex and varied data. Integrating that data, especially across institutions, has always been a challenge. Semantic data integration is the best approach to deal with such challenges. Linked Open Data (LOD) enable large-scale Digital Humanities (DH) research, collaboration and aggregation, allowing DH researchers to make connections between (and make sense of) the multitude of digitized Cultural Heritage (CH) available on the web. An upsurge of interest in semtech and LOD has swept the CH and DH communities. An active Linked Open Data for Libraries, Archives and Museums (LODLAM) community exists, CH data is published as LOD, and international collaborations have emerged. The value of LOD is especially high in the GLAM sector, since culture by its very nature is cross-border and interlinked. We present interesting LODLAM projects, datasets, and ontologies, as well as Ontotext's experience in this domain. An extended version of this paper is available. It has 77 pages, 67 figures, detailed info about CH content and XML standards, Wikidata and global authority control. © 2018 Digital Presentation and Preservation of Cultural and Scientific Heritage.All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The National Library of Finland (NLF) agreed on an "Open National Library" policy in 2016[1]. In the policy there are eight principles, which are divided into accessibility, openness in actions and collaboration. Accessibility in the NLF means that access to the material needs to exist both for the metadata and the content, while respecting the rights of the rights holders. Openness in operations means that our actions and decision models are transparent and clear, and that the materials are accessible to the researchers and other users. These are one way in which the NLF can implement the findable, accessible, interoperable, re-usable (FAIR) data principles [2] themes in practise. The purpose of this paper is to view the way in which the policy has impacted our work and how findability and accessibility have been implemented in particular from the aspects of open, extended, closed and hidden data themes. In addition, our aim is to specify the characteristics of existing and potential forms of data produced by the NLF from the research and development perspectives. A continuous challenge is the availability of the digital resources - gaining access to the digitised material for both researchers and the general public, since there are also constant requests for access to newer materials outside the legal deposit libraries' work stations. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

AB  - While existing Linked Datasets provide detailed representations of Cultural Heritage objects, the locations where the objects originate from is often not accurately represented. Countries, municipalities, and excavation sites are commonly represented by geospatial points, and the fact that countries and municipalities change their geometry over time is not reflected in the data. We present nlGis, a collection of existing geo-historic datasets that are now published as Linked Open Data. The datasets in nlGis contain detailed geographic information about historic regions, with an emphasis on the Netherlands. We describe the creation of this Linked Geodataset and how it can be used to enrich Cultural Heritage data. We also distill several ‘lessons learned’ that can guide future attempts at publishing detailed Linked Geodata in the Cultural Heritage domain. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The paper outlines how the modern information technologies can be used for the preservation and the popularisation of historically and culturally significant Roman sites from the lower part of the Danube Limes, a UNESCO World Heritage site candidate. This specific geographical zone was selected due to the many well preserved, but fairly unknown sites along the lower part of the Danube River and on the border area between Bulgaria and Romania. All results, which are presented in this paper, are obtained during the implementation of the ongoing project 15.2.1.038 Ancient roman cultural heritage interactive visualization environment for the cross border area between Bulgaria and Romania (ARCHIVE), co-financed by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund under the INTERREG V-A Romania-Bulgaria Programme.In the initial sections of the paper we briefly present the international consortium and the structure of the project, its aim and main objectives. The next sections of the paper are focused on the activities for the preservation and popularization of the ancient Roman sites. These activities range from the traditional ground-based photo and video shootings of the selected Roman locations to the use of the modern unmanned aerial vehicles for obtaining low and high altitude photographs, video clips, as well as for the creation of ortho-photo images and 3D models. The paper investigates also the use of 3D scanners and photo cameras for the digitalization and the creation of 3D models of some of the most significant Roman artefacts and the printing of these 3D models as scaled replicas using modern eco-friendly 3D printers. The next section of the paper investigates the possibilities for the use of the created digital materials - for the development of tourist applications for mobile devices, for the creation of electronic educational resources about the Roman history in the cross-border area between Bulgaria and Romania, for the creation of Virtual museums and so on. Last, but not least, we present some topics from the created joint strategy for popularisation of the Roman heritage, which focus on the use of the developed resources for the training and education of the local school and university students. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - An archaeological site is a palimpsest in which the evidence of the depositional episodes is destroyed through the excavation processes; all that remains are the artefacts and their documentary evidence manifested in registers, datasets, dig diaries and reports. While the reports may represent the end product of a specific excavation, the archaeological record tells a story; it is interpretative and dynamic, with later excavations adding new knowledge and narratives. Museums preserve the artefacts but unless the documentary evidence is preserved in standard formats, it cannot be easily re-used by the archaeology community to create that knowledge; nor can museums provide the narratives for the general public whose cultural heritage it is. This article presents a case study from the Ness of Brodgar excavations that examines possibilities for reconciling one part of the data of an archaeological dig, the small finds register (SFR) and its sparse amount of descriptive metadata, with the potentiality of data re-use and with the requirements of a museum that may have custody of the artefacts. It maps and enriches messy domain-specific ontologies to standard archaeological and cultural heritage ontologies and taxonomies using simple natural language processing, linked open data and the museum CIDOC conceptual reference model (CRM). This research, in examining the application of ontology mapping tools, explores common practices and processes that are useful in any discipline within the cultural heritage domain. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Purpose: Recent advances in contemporary virtual reality (VR) technologies are going to have a significant impact on everyday life. Through VR it is possible to virtually explore a computer-generated environment as a different reality, and to immerse oneself into the past or in a virtual museum without leaving the current real-life situation. For such an ultimate VR experience, the user should only see the virtual world. Currently, the user must wear a VR headset which fits around the head and over the eyes to visually separate himself from the physical world. Via the headset images are fed to the eyes through two small lenses. The purpose of this paper is to present the generation of a virtual 3D model of the wooden model of Solomon’s Temple, located at the Hamburg museum (Museum für Hamburgische Geschichte), and its processing for data integration into the two game engines Unity and Unreal. Design/methodology/approach: Cultural heritage (CH) monuments are ideally suited for both thorough multi-dimensional geometric documentation and realistic interactive visualisation in immersive VR applications. Additionally, the game industry offers tools for interactive visualisation of objects to motivate users to virtually visit objects and places. Findings: The project has been carried out by the Photogrammetry & Laser Scanning Lab of the HafenCity University Hamburg, Germany to demonstrate an immersive and interactive visualisation using the VR System HTC Vive. Originality/value: The workflow from data acquisition to VR visualisation, including the necessary programming for navigation and interaction, is described. Furthermore, the use (including simultaneous multiple users environments) of such a VR visualisation for a CH monument is discussed in this contribution. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Semantic Web Identity (SWI) is proposed as the condition in which search engines recognize the existence and nature of entities. The display of a Knowledge Graph Card in Google search results is an indicator of SWI, as it demonstrates that Google has gathered verifiable facts about the entity. Such recognition is likely to improve the accuracy and relevancy of Google's referrals to that entity. This article summarizes part of the research conducted for a recent doctoral dissertation, showing that SWI is poor for ARL libraries. The study hypothesizes that the failure to populate records in appropriate Linked Open Data and proprietary Semantic Web knowledge bases contributes to poor SWI. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - There is a growing interest in the world of Open Data, with many initiatives in the Cultural Heritage field. Platforms like Europeana, archive.org, Open Heritage by Google are only few examples of on-line catalogues full of open artefacts published with various formats. It is a new and promising way to engage public, such as, students, citizens, non-profit organisations. This paper faces the question of how to help audience in reusing Open 3D models and other artefacts available on Open Cultural Heritage repositories. The idea is to provide a Social Platform named SPOD where citizens can visualise artefacts, share and comment with others in a social way to increase understanding, awareness and engagement in cultural heritage. The foundation is the Datalet-Ecosystem Provider (DEEP), an open source, extensible, scalable, and Edge-centric visualisation architecture to support reuse of visualisations of Open Data in Cultural Heritage. It consists of reusable, dynamic and interactive visualizations named datalets. It includes a variety of visualisations, charts, geographical maps and 3D visualisations. Datalets can be generated and embedded in any web-page as well. SPOD exploits the DEEP architecture to support users within the platform in generating visualisations of Open artefacts, reuse and share them within discussions. © 2018 GCH 2018 - Eurographics Workshop on Graphics and Cultural Heritage.

AB  - Knowledge graphs represent the meaning of properties of real-world entities and relationships among them in a natural way. Exploiting semantics encoded in knowledge graphs enables the implementation of knowledge-driven tasks such as semantic retrieval, query processing, and question answering, as well as solutions to knowledge discovery tasks including pattern discovery and link prediction. In this paper, we tackle the problem of knowledge discovery in scholarly knowledge graphs, i.e., graphs that integrate scholarly data, and present Korona, a knowledge-driven framework able to unveil scholarly communities for the prediction of scholarly networks. Korona implements a graph partition approach and relies on semantic similarity measures to determine relatedness between scholarly entities. As a proof of concept, we built a scholarly knowledge graph with data from researchers, conferences, and papers of the Semantic Web area, and apply Korona to uncover co-authorship networks. Results observed from our empirical evaluation suggest that exploiting semantics in scholarly knowledge graphs enables the identification of previously unknown relations between researchers. By extending the ontology, these observations can be generalized to other scholarly entities, e.g., articles or institutions, for the prediction of other scholarly patterns, e.g., co-citations or academic collaboration. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This research proposes the unified system to store and retrieve information related to weave fabric for museums in Thailand using the knowledge graph technique. We have studied the traditional systems that have been used in several museums such as Na Muen Sri Museum and Prince of Songkhla University weave fabric museum. After that we design and implement the unified database schema that can store data from several sources. We also introduce the knowledge graph to connect all knowledges of weave fabric together and improve the data retrieval method to make it more efficient and more related to user queries. User can do a query using natural language like "Weave patterns in Na Muen Sri" or "Oldest handkerchief that has Look Kaew Prasom pattern". These features have a great benefit to everyone including non-IT people. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Smart devices, such as smartphones and wearable cameras, have become widely used, and lifelogging with such gadgets has been recognized as a common activity. Since this trend produces a large amount of individual lifelog records, it is important to support users’ efficient access of their personal lifelog archives. NTCIR Lifelog task series have studied the retrieval setting as a task called Lifelog Semantic Access sub-task (LSAT). This task is that, given a topic of users’ daily activity or events, e.g. “Find the moments when a user was eating any food at his/her desk at work”, as a query, a system retrieves the relevant images of the moments from users’ lifelogging records of their daily lives. Although, in the NTCIR conferences, interactive systems, which can utilize searchers’ feedback in the retrieval process, have showed the higher performance than systems in automatic manner without users’ feedback in the retrieval process, interactive systems rely on the quality of initial results, which can be seen as results of automatic systems. We envision that automatic retrieval that will be used in interactive systems later. In this paper, therefore, based on a principal that the system should be easy to implement for the later applicability, we propose a method scoring lifelog moments using only the meta information generated by publicly available pretrained detectors with word embeddings. Experimental results show the higher performance of the proposed method than the automatic retrieval systems presented in the NTCIR-14 Lifelog-3 task. We also show the retrieval can be further improved by about 0.3 of MAP with query formulation considering relevant/irrelvant writing about multimodal information in query topics. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The document-centric workflows in science have reached (or already exceeded) the limits of adequacy. This is emphasized by recent discussions on the increasing proliferation of scientific literature and the reproducibility crisis. This presents an opportunity to rethink the dominant paradigm of document-centric scholarly information communication and transform it into knowledge-based information flows by representing and expressing information through semantically rich, interlinked knowledge graphs. At the core of knowledge-based information flows is the creation and evolution of information models that establish a common understanding of information communicated between stakeholders as well as the integration of these technologies into the infrastructure and processes of search and information exchange in the research library of the future. By integrating these models into existing and new research infrastructure services, the information structures that are currently still implicit and deeply hidden in documents can be made explicit and directly usable. This has the potential to revolutionize scientific work as information and research results can be seamlessly interlinked with each other and better matched to complex information needs. Furthermore, research results become directly comparable and easier to reuse. As our main contribution, we propose the vision of a knowledge graph for science, present a possible infrastructure for such a knowledge graph as well as our early attempts towards an implementation of the infrastructure. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Obtaining 3D realistic models of urban scenes from accurate range data is nowadays an important research topic, with applications in a variety of fields ranging from Cultural Heritage and digital 3D archiving to monitoring of public works. Processing massive point clouds acquired from laser scanners involves a number of challenges, from data management to noise removal, model compression and interactive visualization and inspection. In this paper, we present a new methodology for the reconstruction of 3D scenes from massive point clouds coming from range lidar sensors. Our proposal includes a panorama-based compact reconstruction where colors and normals are estimated robustly through an error-aware algorithm that takes into account the variance of expected errors in depth measurements. Our representation supports efficient, GPU-based visualization with advanced lighting effects. We discuss the proposed algorithms in a practical application on urban and historical preservation, described by a massive point cloud of 3.5 billion points. We show that we can achieve compression rates higher than 97% with good visual quality during interactive inspections. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We present here the conversion of Linguistic Linked Open Data into Semantic Maps to be used to produce contents in a set of technological applications for Cultural Heritage. The paper describes the architectural data collection and annotation procedure adopted in the Cultural Heritage Orienting Multimodal Experiences (CHROME) project (PRIN 2015 funded by Italian University and Research Ministry). Such data will be used in Multimodal Dialogue Systems to obtain precise information about Architectural Heritage, by means of pointing gestures or verbal requests. In particular, we design conversational agents accessing fine-detailed semantic data linked to available 3D models of historical buildings. The starting point of our scientific approach is the Getty Vocabulary on Art & Architecture Thesaurus, integrated with the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN) and the Union List of Artist Names (ULAN). These data are related to 3D mesh of the considered buildings in order to associate abstract concepts to architectural elements. In the field of 3D architectural investigation, a significant amount of research has been conducted to allow domain experts to represent semantic data while keeping spatial references. We will discuss how this will make it possible to support multimodal user interaction and generate Cultural Heritage presentations. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - The ongoing EU funded INCEPTION project proposes a significant improvement in the 3D modelling for the enhancement of Cultural Heritage knowledge by the use of a BIM approach for the semantic enrichment and management of models. Indeed, when used in the CH field, semantic BIM will be able to connect different users (e.g. scholars, technicians, citizens, governments), supporting the need for interpretation of the cultural heritage model. The expectations on this are quite broad, but the architectural differences make the task quite difficult. Since every building is the final result of different influences and combinations in order to solve practical problems, as well as further additions and changes during time, the INCEPTION project is developing common parameters, setting a nomenclature or “glossary of names” as a starting point to semantic enrichment and modelling in BIM environment. One of the main issues in creating a nomenclature is that there are many different active sources that all have very valuable information that would be interesting to be reused. Furthermore, this means both valuable but potentially competing information needs to be connected. Semantic Web technology and Linked Open Data principles make it possible to define an open H-BIM ontology. This state-of-the-art technology is developed by members of the W3C organization and is at the moment, a mature technology. INCEPTION makes use of the tools available, supporting these standards. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - RDA (Resource Description and Access), was initially released in 2010 and, as it is particularly appropriate for use by libraries, archives and museums, it replaces the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, Second Edition (AACR2). It provides a new structure for the organization of bibliographic data based on the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR), with more emphasis on identifiers and relationships than on descriptions. In November 2016 the RDA Steering Committee announced steps toward progressive adoption of the IFLA Library Reference Model (LRM). RDA supports the Linked Data environment also through the representation of RDA entities, elements, relationship designators and vocabulary encoding schemas in Resource Description Framework (RDF, the syntax of the semantic web) in the RDA Registry. The paper is concerned with the application of the RDA standard within the field of Linked Data and how it may be used to improve the quality of the data produced to reach the advantages that the semantic web can bring to the cultural heritage sector. More specifically it will look at a series of Share Linked Open Data (SHARE-LOD) projects. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Intangible cultural heritage (ICH) is an important part of the excellent traditional culture of all ethnic groups and highlights the regional characteristics and wisdom of the people. ICH has various forms of expression, covers a wide range of fields and contains a wealth of knowledge. The effective organization and management of ICH knowledge is the necessary requirement for the cultural protection and knowledge dissemination in the knowledge age. However the knowledge elements of ICH lack rich semantic information. As a result, the relationship between knowledge elements cannot be fully expressed and revealed, and the knowledge of ICH is isolated and lost. The development of semantic web and Linked Data technology provides new ideas and methods for the organization and sharing of ICH knowledge and changes the way of knowledge representation and expression of ICH. Based on this background, in order to solve those problems, this paper proposes a method system for the knowledge organization and construction of datasets based on Linked Data, which includes the core process from design of ontology model to the construction, storage and publishing of Linked Data. Firstly, this paper sorts out the knowledge elements of ICH and the relationship between them, then constructs the ontology model of ICH knowledge to reveal the abundant knowledge and the internal relations among them. Secondly, this paper studies the process of knowledge organization and the construction of Linked Data including turning entity into RDF, making links between entities, storing and publishing of Linked Data. DBpedia and GeoNames were connected with the internal dataset of ICH to establish a linked open dataset with rich semantic relations and knowledge interconnection and sharing so as to promote knowledge connection and knowledge discovery in the domain of ICH. Finally, taking the ICH in Hubei province as an example, the Linked Data and knowledge service platform of ICH knowledge were constructed to provide innovative knowledge services such as knowledge browsing and knowledge visualization. The idea and technology of ontology and Linked Data have great advantages in the field knowledge organization of ICH. By using Linked Data technology to build the linked open dataset of ICH knowledge in China and linked with the international linked open data the connection sharing openness and influence of ICH knowledge can be improved. This paper only sorted out the basic knowledge elements such as the items inheritors and the inheritance relationship while the granularity of knowledge organization still needs to be further refined. The ontology model of ICH also needs to be further expanded and enriched. The application of Linked Data in knowledge organization and knowledge management of ICH can promote the standardization and normalization of knowledge management of ICH. The construction of high-quality Linked Data and knowledge service platforms can provide data for scientific research of ICH while at the same time making the knowledge of ICH more valuable. In the context of digital humanities research this research has certain reference value for the knowledge management and the protection and dissemination of ICH in China. 13 figs. 4 tabs. 25 refs. © 2019, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

AB  - Change acts as an inherent characteristic of the landscape, and expresses dynamic interactions between its tangible and intangible elements. While the documentation and analysis of spatiotemporal patterns have been broadly discussed, major challenges concern the design of task-oriented, user-friendly landscape visualizations. Geographic information system (GIS) techniques and approaches from visual analytics may bring solutions to those questions. This paper considers the milestone documents for the representation of cultural heritage, and proposes a workflow for assessing the feasibility of the space–time cube concept in landscape representation. The usability of the visualization was examined during the interview with domain experts and potential interdisciplinary users. The evaluation session covered benchmark tasks, feedback, and eye-tracking. The performance of the space–time cube was compared with another spatiotemporal visualization technique and measured in terms of correctness, response time, and satisfaction. The Royal Castle in Warsaw, which was registered in 1980 as a part of Warsaw’s World Heritage Site of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), served as the case study. The user tests show that the designed space–time cube excels for the completion rate; however, more time is required to provide answers to question tasks focusing on comparisons. Together, the case study and feedback from domain experts and participants demonstrate the benefit of the space–time cube concept in designing landscape visualizations. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Cultural heritage is the way of life. Using digital technology to manage the information of cultural heritage has become an important issue on the perseverance of cultural heritage. Several cultural heritage institutions have their own large databases with different metadata schemas. Linked Open Data is a mechanism of publishing structured data that allows metadata to be connected. This paper presents a methodology for integrating, converting Lanna cultural heritage metadata and linking data to external data sources. Our framework uses OAI-PMH (Open Archives Initiative—Protocol for Metadata Harvesting) by converting the various metadata formats to Dublin Core metadata standard. The Dublin Core/XML was used for the integrated metadata to create a central repository of data sources. The OAI harvester was developed to extract data from the various repositories and gather data into the repository. A framework for publishing the repository data as a Linked Data source in the RDF format using the OAM Framework is described. In this framework, ontology is used as a common schema for publishing the RDF data from the database sources by mapping database schema to ontology. Finally, we demonstrate Linked Data consumption by creating a cultural heritage portal application prototype from the published RDF data sources. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

AB  - Computer vision and robotics problems often require representation and estimation of poses on the SE(3) manifold. Developers of algorithms that must run in real time face several time-consuming programming tasks, including deriving and computing analytic derivatives and avoiding mathematical errors when handling poses in multiple coordinate frames. To support rapid and error-free development, we present wave-geometry, a C++ manifold geometry library with two key contributions: expression template-based automatic differentiation and compile-time enforcement of coordinate frame semantics. We contrast the library with existing open source packages and show that it can evaluate Jacobians in forward and reverse mode with little to no runtime overhead compared to hand-coded derivatives. The library is available at https://github.com/wavelab/wave-geometry. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Describing cultural heritage objects from the perspective of Linked Open Data (LOD) is not a trivial task. The process often requires not only choosing pertinent ontologies but also developing new models that preserve the most information and express the semantic power of cultural heritage data. Indeed, data managed in archives, libraries, and museums are complex objects themselves, which require a deep reflection on even nonconventional conceptual models. Starting from these considerations, this article describes a research project: to expose the vastness of one of the most important collections of European cultural heritage, the Zeri Photo Archive, as LOD. We describe here the steps we undertook to this end. First, we developed two ad hoc ontologies for describing all issues not completely covered by existent models (the F Entry and the OA Entry Ontology). Then we mapped into RDF the descriptive elements used in the current Zeri Photo Archive catalog, converting into CIDOC CRM and into the two new aforementioned models the source data based on the Italian content standards Scheda F (photography entry, in English) and Scheda OA (work of art entry, in English). Finally, we created an RDF dataset of the output of the mapping that could show a result capable of demonstrating the complexity of our scenario. © 2017 ACM.

AB  - Background: The biodiversity domain, and in particular biological taxonomy, is moving in the direction of semantization of its research outputs. The present work introduces OpenBiodiv-O, the ontology that serves as the basis of the OpenBiodiv Knowledge Management System. Our intent is to provide an ontology that fills the gaps between ontologies for biodiversity resources, such as DarwinCore-based ontologies, and semantic publishing ontologies, such as the SPAR Ontologies. We bridge this gap by providing an ontology focusing on biological taxonomy. Results: OpenBiodiv-O introduces classes, properties, and axioms in the domains of scholarly biodiversity publishing and biological taxonomy and aligns them with several important domain ontologies (FaBiO, DoCO, DwC, Darwin-SW, NOMEN, ENVO). By doing so, it bridges the ontological gap across scholarly biodiversity publishing and biological taxonomy and allows for the creation of a Linked Open Dataset (LOD) of biodiversity information (a biodiversity knowledge graph) and enables the creation of the OpenBiodiv Knowledge Management System. A key feature of the ontology is that it is an ontology of the scientific process of biological taxonomy and not of any particular state of knowledge. This feature allows it to express a multiplicity of scientific opinions. The resulting OpenBiodiv knowledge system may gain a high level of trust in the scientific community as it does not force a scientific opinion on its users (e.g. practicing taxonomists, library researchers, etc.), but rather provides the tools for experts to encode different views as science progresses. Conclusions: OpenBiodiv-O provides a conceptual model of the structure of a biodiversity publication and the development of related taxonomic concepts. It also serves as the basis for the OpenBiodiv Knowledge Management System. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper argues that representing texts as semantic Linked Data provides a useful basis for analyzing their contents in Digital Humanities research and for Cultural Heritage application development. The idea is to transform Cultural Heritage texts into a knowledge graph and a Linked Data service that can be used flexibly in different applications via a SPARQL endpoint. The argument is discussed and evaluated in the context of biographical and prosopographical research and a case study where over 13 000 life stories form biographical collections of Biographical Centre of the Finnish Literature Society were transformed into RDF, enriched by data linking, and published in a SPARQL endpoint. Tools for biography and prosopography, data clustering, network analysis, and linguistic analysis were created with promising first results. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Wikipedia and its community has seen an increasingly close relationship between library communities, with both communities sharing overlapping values and practices related to public access to knowledge, a desire for openness, defence of freedom of speech, representing marginalized communities, and broad shared interest in reliable factual information and citations. This is best in evidence from the IFLA’ Wikipedia and Libraries Opportunity Papers and the substantial growth and ubiquity of the #1lib1ref campaign. However, the relationships between cultural heritage organizations (known as GLAMs – Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) and the Wikimedia communities working on Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons and other Wikimedia projects, began in its relationships to Museums and Archives: partnerships like that with the British Museum in 2010 led to a collective effort to encourage GLAM organizations to contribute to and participate in Wikimedia Communities. Though early partnerships in the GLAM-Wiki space focused on batch uploads of digital content to Wikimedia Commons, embedding Wikimedia-designated experts called Wikipedians in Residence, and editing activities, like editathons, which write expert advised content into Wikipedia, in the last 6 years, the landscape in which partnership with cultural heritage institutions has shifted radically. Two major trends have developed in the Wikimedia community: a shift towards facilitating linked open data with Wikidata and the expansion of GLAM-Wiki projects to support institutions that not only have large digital capacity and funding, but also institutions with limited resources, collections focused on marginalized knowledge, and collections in parts of the world with limited digital expertise. In this transition, Wikimedia communities have become change agents in bringing both linked open data and open digital practices to institutions around the world. In this paper, we will explore how GLAM-Wiki tactics, opportunities and collaboration are changing the GLAM use of Wikimedia projects from being viewed as just a platform for exposing collection to a broader public audience, into a growing part of the heritage professional toolkit. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Knowledge graphs capture very little temporal information associated with facts. In this work, we address the problem of identifying time intervals of knowledge graph facts from large document collections annotated with temporal expressions. Prior approaches in this direction have leveraged limited metadata associated with documents in large collections (e.g., publication dates) or have limited techniques to model the uncertainty and dynamics of temporal expressions. Our approach to identify time intervals for time-sensitive facts in knowledge graphs leverages a time model that incorporates uncertainty and models them at different levels of granularity (i.e., day, month, and year). Evaluation on a temporal fact benchmark using two large news archives amounting to more than eleven million documents show the quality of our results. © 2018 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 License.

AB  - Technology could sensitize end-users to preservation of cultural heritage while stimulating more interest based on a greater involvement. Our approach to this goal is based on a novel gamification and story-telling based on scientific foundations. At the same time, this application can offer the pro-user an interactive visualization suitable to study and verify new theories about the artifacts both on their current state and on its 3D reconstruction, but, at the same time, design a workflow capable to integrate different optimization techniques to adjust data depending on different scenarios. This leads to a unified system able to adapt itself to external requirements in a semi-automatic fashion. Finally, new ways of playful interaction, based on simple mathematical operations, were investigated.

AB  - Exploratory search is a paradigm of information retrieval, in which the user’s intention is to learn the subject domain better. To do this the user repeats “query–browse–refine” interactions with the search engine many times. We consider typical exploratory search tasks formulated by long text queries. People usually solve such a task in about half an hour and find dozens of documents using conventional search facilities iteratively. The goal of this paper is to reduce the time-consuming multi-step process to one step without impairing the quality of the search. Probabilistic topic modeling is a suitable text mining technique to retrieve documents, which are semantically relevant to a long text query. We use the additive regularization of topic models (ARTM) to build a model that meets multiple objectives. The model should have sparse, diverse and interpretable topics. Also, it should incorporate meta-data and multimodal data such as n-grams, authors, tags and categories. Balancing the regularization criteria is an important issue for ARTM. We tackle this problem with coordinate-wise optimization technique, which chooses the regularization trajectory automatically. We use the parallel online implementation of ARTM from the open source library BigARTM. Our evaluation technique is based on crowdsourcing and includes two tasks for assessors: the manual exploratory search and the explicit relevance feedback. Experiments on two popular tech news media show that our topic-based exploratory search outperforms assessors as well as simple baselines, achieving precision and recall of about 85–92%. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

AB  - In this article we discuss the heuristic capabilities that the process of generating, processing, and integrating cultural heritage linked data may afford, including its potential for enhancing arts and humanities research. More specifically, we report on our current work on detecting and assigning gender properties to person entities and semantically enriching a set of Linked Open Data (LOD) in the domain of history of jazz. Linked Jazz-an ongoing project that experiments with the application of LOD principles and techniques to cultural heritage materials- provided the context for this research. Linked Jazz aims to uncover meaningful connections between data and documents from digital archives of jazz history. It employs oral histories as the main source of named entities to be represented as linked data. The entities are then semantically connected and visualized as social graphs. Using the assignment of gender properties, this article describes how the data development process itself offers new and unanticipated paths of research inquiry and engagement with heritage data. © The Author 2016.

AB  - This article is a preliminary report on the work of the Canadian Linked Data Initiative (CLDI), a collaboration between five of Canada’s largest research libraries, Library and Archives Canada, Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec, and Canadiana.org. Although still in its nascent stage, participating institutions are working together to advance the technical services divisions of our libraries in the area of linked data. Project working groups are making progress in five main areas: grant funding, digital collections, education and training, legacy metadata enhancement, and in the evaluation and adaptation of Bibliographic Framework Transition Initiative tools. By working across geographic and institutional boundaries, the CLDI aims to chart a path to a new age of technical services, one based on the foundation of Linked Open Data. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC © Marlene van Ballegooie, Juliya Borie and Andrew Senior.

AB  - One of the most effective strategies that can be adopted to make successful cultural heritage expositions consists in attracting the visitors’ attention and improving their enjoyment/engagement. A mid-air gesture-based Natural User Interface was designed, through the user-centric approach, for the navigation of virtual tours in cultural heritage exhibitions. In detail, the proposed interface was developed to “visit” Murgia, a karst zone lying within Puglia, very famous for its fortified farms, dolines, sinkholes, and caves. Including an “immersive” gesture-based interface was demonstrated to improve the user's experience thus giving her/him the sensation of “exploring” in a seamless manner the wonderful and rather adventurous sites of Murgia. User tests aimed at comparing the implemented interface with a conventional mouse-controlled one confirmed the capability of the proposed interface to enhance the user engagement/enjoyment and to make “more” natural/real, the virtual environment. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Black performance art, from the outset, is a vexed form; it is inextricably linked to histories of subjugation, imperialism, and personal sovereignty. Valerie Cassel Oliver concurs, arguing that black performance in the Americas may have emerged as a by-product of chattel slavery, a “dysfunctional inheritance born from mastering both personal and communal survival”. A still more panoramic view of black performance art, and its attendant aesthetic lineages, pans out even further from the prototypical confines of the museum/gallery, moving from the mundanity of the urban landscape into the ecstatic energies of nightlife. For instance, performance art produced by black American artists was excluded from museums, often at the expense of the performing arts, which artist Clifford Owens argues is due to the perception the latter more easily reads as black cultural expression. “The dramaturgy of power that haunts racial politics and contemporary expressive cultural codes was first ‘formatted’ in those grim locations”. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This contribution shows the comparison, investigation, and implementation of different access strategies on multimodal data. The first part of the research is structured as a theoretical part opposing and explaining the terms of conventional access, virtual archival access, and virtual museums while additionally referencing related work. Especially, issues that still persist in repositories like the ambiguity or missing of metadata is pointed out. The second part explains the practical implementation of a workflow from a large image repository to various four-dimensional (4D) applications. Mainly, the filtering of images and in the following, the orientation of images is explained. Selection of the relevant images is partly carried out manually but also with the use of deep convolutional neural networks for image classification. In the following, photogrammetric methods are used for finding the relative orientation between image pairs in a projective frame. For this purpose, an adapted Structure from Motion (SfM) workflow is presented, in which the step of feature detection and matching is replaced by the Radiant-Invariant Feature Transform (RIFT) and Matching On Demand with View Synthesis (MODS). Both methods have been evaluated on a benchmark dataset and performed superior to other approaches. Subsequently, the oriented images are placed interactively and in the future automatically in a 4D browser application showing images, maps, and building models. Further usage scenarios are presented in several Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. The new representation of the archival data enables spatial and temporal browsing of repositories allowing the research of innovative perspectives and the uncovering of historical details. © UPV, SEAV, 2015.

AB  - Europeana gives access to data from Galleries, Libraries, Archives & Museums across Europe. Semantic and multilingual diversity as well as the variable quality of our metadata make it difficult to create a digital library offering end-user services such as multilingual search. To palliate this, we are building an “Entity Collection”, a knowledge graph that holds data about entities (places, people, concepts and organizations) bringing context to the cultural heritage objects. The diversity and heterogeneity of our metadata has encouraged us to re-use and combine third-party data instead of relying only on those contributed by our own providers. This raises however several design issues. This paper lists the most important of these and describes our choices for tackling them using Linked Data and Semantic Web approaches. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

AB  - Quantitative and qualitative analyses of cultural heritage (CH) assets need to interconnect individual pieces of information, including a variety of multimodal acquisitions, to form a holistic compounded view of studied objects. The need for joint acquisition brings with it the requirement for defining a protocol to store, structure and support the interoperability of the multisource data. In our work, we are performing multiple imaging studies in order to analyze the material, to monitor the behavior and to diagnose the status of CH objects. In particular, we employ, in addition to coarse 3D scanning, two high-resolution surface data capture techniques: reflectance transformation imaging and microprofilometry. Given this multivariate input, we have defined a hierarchical data organization, similar to the one used in the medical field by the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) protocol, that supports pre-alignment of local patches with respect to a global model. Furthermore, we have developed two supporting tools for multimodal data handling: one for metadata annotation and another one for image registration. In this work, we illustrate our approach and discuss its practical application in a case study on a real CH object - a bronze bas-relief. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - The evolution of the Web of documents into a Web of services and data has resulted in an increased availability of data from almost any domain. For example, general domain knowledge bases such as DBpedia or Wikidata, or domain specific Web sources like the Oxford Art archive, allow for accessing knowledge about a wide variety of entities including people, organizations, or art paintings. However, these data sources publish data in different ways, and they may be equipped with different search capabilities, e.g., SPARQL endpoints or REST services, thus requiring data integration techniques that provide a unified view of the published data. We devise a semantic data integration approach named FuhSen that exploits keyword and structured search capabilities of Web data sources and generates on-demand knowledge graphs merging data collected from available Web sources. Resulting knowledge graphs model semantics or meaning of merged data in terms of entities that satisfy keyword queries, and relationships among those entities. FuhSen relies on both RDF to semantically describe the collected entities, and on semantic similarity measures to decide on relatedness among entities that should be merged. We empirically evaluate the results of FuhSen data integration techniques on data from the DBpedia knowledge base. The experimental results suggest that FuhSen data integration techniques accurately integrate similar entities semantically into knowledge graphs. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Video games have a short but rich history. Therefore, they have been gaining popularity as cultural heritage and research material. Several studies have analyzed the metadata and cataloging of video games. However, the research on its implementation is limited. Hence, we investigate the practice of cataloging video games at the Center for Game Studies, Ritsumeikan University (RCGS) in this study and examine the effectiveness of data utilization from Wikidata to construct an authority of works for video games. We accomplished this by associating the distribution package with Wikipedia and Wikidata. Consequently, records of works covering approximately half of the video games were created. However, the problem of uniformity of granularity and completeness was found in these data based on Wikipedia's culture and policies. Thus, data enrichment is difficult owing to the non-uniform granularity of bibliography with Wikidata. In contrast, the cost of data creation is effective. Furthermore, the external link ID is highly effective in enhancing the value of catalog as Linked Open Data (LOD). It is also evident that using published authority data is useful for data integration but Wikidata has some problems with its features. There is a need to consider the function and purpose of the catalog as linked data instead of a separate catalog. Thus, the adaptation of Wikidata for catalogs needs to be designed accordingly as linked data. © 2019 Dublin Core metadata initiative. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article deals with the meanings of the mA-infinitive abessive (e.g. syd-mcitta 'without eating\juo-matta 'without drinking, nukku-matta 'without sleeping) as an adjunct in phrasal expressions in the light of dialect corpora (matta-construction). The data has been gathered from Lauseopin arkisto (LA, Syntax Archive), Digitaalinen Muoto- opin arkisto (DMA, Digital Morphology Archive), and from volumes 1-8 of Suomen murteiden sanakirja (SMS, Dictionary of Finnish dialects). The research concentrates on issues such as 1) what type of negation the adverbial matta-construction constitutes on a general level and 2) what adverbial meanings can be inferred from it. To examine these questions, the author has employed the (traditional) syntactic-semantic analysis of the corpus data and Frame Semantics as a branch of Construction Grammar. As an adverbial, the matta-structure is conceptually attached to a frame defined by the dominant finite structure, and its meanings depend on the relationship between the finite and the infinite structures. Factors influencing this interpretation are lexical semantics (e.g. hyponymy), subject interpretations (the same or different subjects), temporality (the same or different temporal affinities), and other frame semantic relationships between states of affairs. It becomes apparent that the Te-infinitive instructive (ten-structure, e.g. syd-den 'by eating'), the mA-infinitive adessive (malla- structure, e.g. syd-malla 'by (means of) eating'), and the matta-structure constitute a semantic subgroup, i.e. infinitives of manner and means within the Finnish infinitive system. These are associated with divergent meanings of manner. However, the matta-structure also carries other meanings of negation due to the complex conceptual structure of the abessive. ©2018 Kotikielen Seura. of Pharmacology.All right reserved.

AB  - Archival records produced by individuals are a singularity in the cultural heritage field. In detail, these archives are a special typology, useful to think about linked open data (LOD) as a strategy for enhancing a deep interconnection in the Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM) system. Two are, in these archival collections, the interesting features to stress: the heterogeneity of documents (both by type and support) and the suite of relationships, even latent, that these documents would carry out (between people, between a person and the archival collection, and, in particular, between a person and other related resources). Ontologies are a decisive step in building LOD. Though not explicitly included in the '5 stars' by Tim Berners Lee, conceptual models are able to provide the semantic deepness needed to enhance the domain description, by giving value to typed link and extending, as a result, the network of interconnection. The project realized on the archive by Federico Zeri, held at the University of Bologna, can be a useful starting point for rethinking the archival description in a GLAM environment.

AB  - Intangible cultural heritage (ICH) is a precious historical and cultural resource of a country. Protection and inheritance of ICH is important to the sustainable development of national culture. There are many different intangible cultural heritage items in China. With the development of information technology, ICH database resources were built by government departments or public cultural services institutions, but most databases were widely dispersed. Certain traditional database systems are disadvantageous to storage, management and analysis of massive data. At the same time, a large quantity of data has been produced, accompanied by digital intangible cultural heritage development. The public is unable to grasp key knowledge quickly because of the massive and fragmented nature of the data. To solve these problems, we proposed the intangible cultural heritage knowledge graph to assist knowledge management and provide a service to the public. ICH domain ontology was defined with the help of intangible cultural heritage experts and knowledge engineers to regulate the concept, attribute and relationship of ICH knowledge. In this study, massive ICH data were obtained, and domain knowledge was extracted from ICH text data using the Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology. A knowledge base based on domain ontology and instances for Chinese intangible cultural heritage was constructed, and the knowledge graph was developed. The pattern and characteristics behind the intangible cultural heritage were presented based on the ICH knowledge graph. The knowledge graph for ICH could foster support for organization, management and protection of the intangible cultural heritage knowledge. The public can also obtain the ICH knowledge quickly and discover the linked knowledge. The knowledge graph is helpful for the protection and inheritance of intangible cultural heritage. © 2018

AB  - The rich epigraphic heritage of the Castello Ursino Civic Museum of Catania has been studied by the EpiCUM project that encoded it in EpiDoc TEI XML, an XML based standard digital representation for cultural heritage contents. The project made the epigraphic heritage available in a digital museum: under the guise of the 'Voci di Pietra' exhibition, a selection of epigraphs were presented, implementing innovative presentation modalities thanks to a smart use of technological and digital means. Information contained in the epigraphs was semantically reorganized in a unique homogeneous container, the EpiONT ontology, constructed according to the Linked Open Data paradigm and to consolidated international standards. The encoding of the ancient texts, by the TEI standard and its EpiDoc subset, is wedded to the paradigmatic semantic web model for museums and cultural heritage. The EpiONT ontology is currently populated by 580 epigraphs collected in the Castello Ursino Civic Museum. Designed according to the CIDOC CRM standard, it makes use of the SKOS vocabularies of the EAGLE project concerning material, execution technique, type of inscription, and type of support of an epigraph. The EpiONT ontology additionally can handle any uncertainty in the origin and place of discovery of the epigraphs. © 2019 Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche. All rights reserved.

AB  - Scholarly search engines, reference management tools, and academic social networks enable modern researchers to organize their scientific libraries. Moreover, they often provide recommendations for scientific publications that might be of interest to researchers. Because of the exponentially increasing volume of publications, effective citation recommendation is of great importance to researchers, as it reduces the time and effort spent on retrieving, understanding, and selecting research papers. In this context, we address the problem of citation recommendation, i.e., the task of recommending citations for a new paper. Current research investigates this task in different settings, including cases where rich user metadata is available (e.g., user profile, publications, citations). This work focus on a setting where the user provides only the abstract of a new paper as input. Our proposed approach is to expand the semantic features of the given abstract using knowledge graphs - and, combine them with other features (e.g., indegree, recency) to fit a learning to rank model. This model is used to generate the citation recommendations. By evaluating on real data, we show that the expanded semantic features lead to improving the quality of the recommendations measured by nDCG@10. © 2018-IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present the knowledge structure based on the articles published in Library Hi Tech. The research hotspots are expected to be revealed through the keyword co-occurrence and social network analysis. Design/methodology/approach: Data sets based on publications from Library Hi Tech covering the time period from 2006 to 2017 were extracted from Web of Science and developed as testbeds for evaluation of the CiteSpace system. Highly cited keywords were analyzed by CiteSpace which supports visual exploration with knowledge discovery in bibliographic databases. Findings: The findings suggested that the percentage of publications in the USA, Germany, China, and Canada are high. Further, the most popular keywords identified in Library Hi Tech were: “service,” “technology,” “digital library,” “university library,” and “academic library.” Finally, four research issues were identified based on the most-cited articles in Library Hi Tech. Originality/value: While keyword plays an important role in scientific research, limited studies paid attention to the keyword analysis in librarian research. The contribution of this study is to systematically explore the knowledge structure constructed by the keywords in Library Hi Tech. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Spain is a hot-spot for the European tourism that conforms an important part of its economy. Large cities tend to monopolize this sector unbalancing the outcome of the tourism in Spain. Promoting festivals from less-known regions that belong to the Spanish cultural heritage has been proposed as a solution to balance the economy of this sector. Unfortunately there is a lack of visibility of such festivals that hinders the feasibility of such approach. In this paper we introduce the Linked-Fiestas dataset that aims at providing data of festivals and events from not so well-known regions, so spreading their cultural heritage, bringing visibility to them, and thus, increasing tourists interest. Linked-Fiestas gathers data from well-known datasets, such as DBpedia and Wikidata, and from other datasets outside the Web of Data community. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - Intangible cultural heritage (ICH) contains rich knowledge, and the effective organization and management of ICH knowledge is the foundation for the protection and inheritance of ICH. The development of semantic Web technology changes the way of knowledge representation and expression and provides new ideas and methods for the organizing and sharing of ICH knowledge. This paper describes a research project: to model and manage the ICH knowledge by publishing the knowledge as linked data. Firstly, a knowledge ontology was designed to reveal and standardize the concept, attribute and relationship of ICH knowledge elements. Then, we converted the knowledge to RDF data basted on the knowledge ontology and linked the entities with DBpedia and GeoNames. Finally, taking the ICH in Hubei province as an example, the methodology was used to create an RDF dataset which published as linked open data, and develop a knowledge service platform based on the linked data service. The research has promoted the standardization of knowledge management of ICH in China, which is of great significance for the protection and dissemination of ICH.

AB  - The major aim of this paper is to present a non-destructive GIS-based method for a frescoes and Icon analysis pat of the cultural heritage. The proposed methodology is based on the combination of topographic surveys, digital photogrammetry and image processing techniques by means of four control points and one photography of the target at least, that become metric rectified image at any plane defined by the user. It is possible to quantify any physical characteristic of the surface of a frescoe as well as alterations on its surface that produce deviations from flatness. The Bundle adjustment was applied to a 2D reconstruction algorithm instead to a 3D reconstruction algorithm to control frescoe, from the Ramet Monastery. There are many reasons and motives for digital modelling of real world objects, including: virtual reconstruction of historical artifacts icons and frescoes that no longer or only partially exist, digital documentation of pictures for restoration purposes in case of fire, flood, etc.; ability for virtual interaction without the risk of damage; production of e-learning data for educational resources; virtual tourism; virtual museum exhibits; and interactive visualisation of the objects. © 2018 Scibulcom Ltd.

AB  - CHISel is a cultural heritage information system that supports the extensive organization, tracking, and implementation of data on 3D computer generated models of archaeological artefacts and site. We conducted a detailed user test of CHISel, to assess the usability of the complex and numerous system features, in order to assess the efficiency, user satisfaction, memorability, learnability, and accuracy. These qualities are particularly crucial to software like CHISel, which has a high learning curve for new and inexperienced users, involves professional, field-specific users, requires high-precision, high accuracy and contains a large amount of complex system features that must function well in order for the program to work as an apt integrative system. © 2018 Authors.

AB  - Many artworks such as paintings or sculptures are accessible mainly through vision; visually impaired people therefore cannot benefit from the beauty, emotion or information inspired by these objects. Some trials at tactile presentation of artworks exist in research laboratories and some museums. In research laboratories such approaches are related to several synergetic components such as through the design of new multi-touch stimulation devices, the models of percepts’ emergence from perceptions (stimulation), object simplification with “conservation of meaning”, multimodal data fusion, etc. Museums are not only interested in multimodal (audio-tactile) presentations of artworks, but also in the physical accessibility of exhibition halls and self-guidance through collections. Specific wearable technologies and specific adaptable guides are necessary. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - ModRef is a project from the laboratory Labex "Les passés dans le présent", which coordinates various projects on digital humanities. ModRef focuses on the semantic web and linked open data. The goal is to move heterogeneous data into triplestores also called data warehouses or collections of RDF files in order to improve the sharing, exchange and discovery of new knowledge. For this purpose, the CIDOC-CRM norm has been chosen since it is, at present, the reference for the semantic description of museographic or cultural heritage data. In order to realise the proof of concept of ModRef, a general architecture has been defined, a semantic modelling and data mapping of selected sub-projects of ModRef have been proposed, triplestores have also been created. A web application has been implemented and deployed. It describes the ModRef project, as well as it enables visualising, querying and exploring created triplestores. We also present and discuss the factorisation of data migration into triplestores. © 2018 Lavoisier. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the last few years, public administrations and university archives have been promoting the dissemination of cultural heritage via the web, so making it accessible and shared. The aim of those promoting the Open Access movement was to encourage the democratic and fast distribution of scientific knowledge. Furthermore, the benefits of using and sharing linked data do not accrue only to the public administration, though this may indeed become more efficient and effective, but also profits the citizenry, as online tools can stimulate public participation and social inclusion. © 2019 Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche.

AB  - Dictionaries, encyclopedias, knowledge graphs, annotated corpora, library classification systems and world maps are all examples of human-curated knowledge resources that have been highly valuable to science as well as amortized across multiple large-scale systems in practice. Many of these were started and built even before a crowdsourcing research community existed. While the last decade has seen unprecedented growth in research and practice in building crowdsourcing systems to do increasingly complex tasks at scale, many of these resources are still woefully incompletelacking coverage in languages and subject matter domains. Moreover, many knowledge resources needed to fill other semantic gaps for artificial intelligence systems simply don't exist or arent being built. Why I argue that we don't have the right incentives, and that in order to improve the incentives, we have some fundamental scientific questions to answer. While building a large knowledge resource, we have little more than intuitions when it comes to estimating the reusability, maintainability, and long-term value of the effort. These make it difficult to fund or manage such projects, often requiring herculean personalities or fortunate businesses. Building or expanding a resource is often not seen as "sexy," which results in lack of resources to answer those questions in any principled manner. These problems begin to outline a new science of curation, making progress on which could help improve the discussion around and funding for building sorely needed knowledge resources. © 2018 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 License.

AB  - Three major French cultural institutions—the French National Library (BnF), Radio France and the Philharmonie de Paris—have come together in order to develop shared methods to describe semantically their catalogs of music works and events. This process comprises the construction of knowledge graphs representing the data contained in these catalogs following a novel agreed upon ontology that extends CIDOC-CRM and FRBRoo, the linking of these graphs and their open publication on the web. A number of specialized tools that allow for the reproduction of this process are developed, as well as web applications for easy access and navigation through the data. The paper presents one of the main outcomes of this project—the DOREMUS knowledge graph, consisting of three linked datasets describing classical music works and their associated events (e.g., performances in concerts). This resource fills an important gap between library content description and music metadata. We present the DOREMUS pipeline for lifting and linking the data, the tools developed for these purposes, as well as a search application allowing to explore the data. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - Preparing high-quality learning material is a time-intensive, yet crucial task for teachers of all educational levels. In this paper, we present SoLeMiO, a tool to recommend and integrate learning material in popular authoring software. As teachers create their learning material, SoLeMiO identifies the concepts they want to address. In order to identify relevant concepts in a reliable, automatic and unambiguous way, we employ state of the art concept recognition and entity linking tools. From the recognized concepts, we build a semantic representation by exploiting additional information from Open Knowledge Graphs through expansion and filtering strategies. These concepts and the semantic representation of the learning material support the authoring process in two ways. First, teachers will be recommended related, heterogeneous resources from an open corpus, including digital libraries, domain-specific knowledge bases, and MOOC platforms. Second, concepts are proposed for semi-automatic tagging of the newly authored learning resource, fostering its reuse in different e-learning contexts. Our approach currently supports resources in English, French, and Spanish. An evaluation of concept identification in lecture video transcripts and a user study based on the quality of tag and resource recommendations yielded promising results concerning the feasibility of our technique. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - Introduction: Dementia is one of the greatest health challenges the world will face in the coming decades, as it is one of the principal causes of disability and dependency among older people. Economic modelling is used widely across many health conditions to inform decisions on health and social care policy and practice. The aim of this literature review is to systematically identify, review and critically evaluate existing health economics models in dementia. We included the full spectrum of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), from preclinical stages through to severe dementia and end of life. This review forms part of the Real world Outcomes across the Alzheimer's Disease spectrum for better care: multimodal data Access Platform (ROADMAP) project. Methods and analysis: Electronic searches were conducted in Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica dataBASE, Economic Literature Database, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, Research Papers in Economics, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness, Science Citation Index, Turning Research Into Practice and Open Grey for studies published between January 2000 and the end of June 2017. Two reviewers will independently assess each study against predefined eligibility criteria. A third reviewer will resolve any disagreement. Data will be extracted using a predefined data extraction form following best practice. Study quality will be assessed using the Phillips checklist for decision analytic modelling. A narrative synthesis will be used. Ethics and dissemination: The results will be made available in a scientific peer-reviewed journal paper, will be presented at relevant conferences and will also be made available through the ROADMAP project. © 2018 Article author(s).

AB  - Cultural heritage (CH) resources are very diverse, heterogeneous, discontinuous and subject to possible updates and revisions in nature. The use of semantic web technologies associated with 3D graphical tools is proposed to improve the access, the exploration, the mining and the enrichment of this CH data in a standardized and more structured form. This paper presents a new ontology-based tool that allows to visualize spatial clustering over 3D distribution of CH artifacts. The data that we are processing consists of the archaeological shipwreck”Xlendi, Malta”, which was collected by photogrammtry and modeled by the Arpenteur ontology. Following semantic web best practices, the produced CH dataset was published as linked open data (LOD). © 2018 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Heritage management is a complex and demanding task; when successful, it will always show (either in the forefront or in the background) the compound multidisciplinary approach standing behind it. Heritage interpretation, not surprisingly, very often plays a key role in this process. Contemporary understanding of heritage management, by professionals as well as by laymen (since they are interconnected), must consider all the relevant (site/county/country/region) specific factors, foremost the social or economic ones beside essential preservation. Heritage management tends towards ensuring tangible (as well as intangible, or more precisely indirect) benefits for local communities and in this way towards the development of society in general. Critical heritage studies over the last few years have significantly influenced the perception of heritage, and consequently the essence of heritage management and heritage interpretation. Stress on the participative and inclusive approach has become crucial, where multi/polyvocality is (almost) self-evident. While the aforementioned words are regular buzzwords today, this article looks for their origins. Surprisingly, this practice could be easily tracked to the early 1970s and the eco-museums movement which is quite a revealing experience. We attempt to demonstrate how the practices of eco-museums could be interlinked with contemporary demands, the need for participative and inclusive heritage interpretation, and management approaches/practices. Finally, the paper will point forward the need for socially responsible heritage management which could indeed be recognised as a demand for heritage literacy and as a model/tool to mitigate diverse interests where contemporary heritage management is concerned. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is one of the important non-material cultural heritages of the Chinese nation. It is an important development strategy of Chinese medicine to collect, analyzes, and manages the knowledge assets of TCM health care. As a novel and massive knowledge management technology, knowledge graph provides an ideal technical means to solve the problem of “Knowledge Island” in the field of traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, we construct a large-scale knowledge graph, which integrates terms, documents, databases and other knowledge resources. This knowledge graph can facilitate various knowledge services such as knowledge visualization, knowledge retrieval, and knowledge recommendation, and helps the sharing, interpretation, and utilization of TCM health care knowledge. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Development and virtual representation of 3D models of Cultural Heritage (CH) objects has triggered great interest over the past decade. The main reason for this is the rapid development in the fields of photogrammetry and remote sensing, laser scanning, and computer vision. The advantages of using 3D models for restoration, preservation, and documentation of valuable historical and architectural objects have been numerously demonstrated by scientists in the field. Moreover, 3D model visualization in virtual reality has been recognized as an efficient, fast, and easy way of representing a variety of objects worldwide for present-day users, who have stringent requirements and high expectations. However, the main focus of recent research is the visual, geometric, and textural characteristics of a single concrete object, while integration of large numbers of models with additional information-such as historical overview, detailed description, and location-are missing. Such integrated information can be beneficial, not only for tourism but also for accurate documentation. For that reason, we demonstrate in this paper an integration of high-resolution spherical panoramas, a variety of maps, GNSS, sound, video, and text information for representation of numerous cultural heritage objects. These are then displayed in a web-based portal with an intuitive interface. The users have the opportunity to choose freely from the provided information, and decide for themselves what is interesting to visit. Based on the created web application, we provide suggestions and guidelines for similar studies. We selected objects, which are located in Bulgaria-a country with thousands of years of history and cultural heritage dating back to ancient civilizations. The methods used in this research are applicable for any type of spherical or cylindrical images and can be easily followed and applied in various domains. After a visual and metric assessment of the panoramas and the evaluation of the web-portal, we conclude that this novel approach is a very effective, fast, informative, and accurate way to present, disseminate, and document cultural heritage objects. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Many projects have already analyzed the current limitations and challenges on the integration of the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud in mobile augmented reality (MAR) applications for cultural heritage, and underline the future directions and capabilities. The majority of the above works relies on the detected geo-location of the user or his device by various sensors (GPS - global positioning system, accelerometer, camera, etc.) or geo-based linked data, while others use marker-based techniques to link various locations with labels and descriptions of specific geodata. But when it comes to indoor environments (museums, libraries) where tracking the accurate user’s position and orientation is challenging due to the lack of GPS valid sensor data, complex and costly technological systems need to be implemented for identifying user’s OoI (Object of Interest). This paper describes a concept which is based on image identification and matching between frames from the user’s camera and stored images from the Europeana platform, that can link the LOD cloud from cultural institutes around Europe and mobile augmented reality applications in cultural heritage without the need of the accurate user’s location, and discusses the challenges and future directions of this approach. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - Recent advances in contemporary Virtual Reality (VR) technologies are going to have a significant impact on veryday life. Through VR it is possible to virtually explore a computer-generated environment as a different reality, and to immerse oneself into the past or in a virtual museum without leaving the current real-life situation. For such the ultimate VR experience, the user should only see the virtual world. Currently, the user must wear a VR headset which fits around the head and over the eyes to visually separate themselves from the physical world. Via the headset images are fed to the eyes through two small lenses. Cultural heritage monuments are ideally suited both for thorough multi-dimensional geometric documentation and for realistic interactive visualisation in immersive VR applications. Additionally, the game industry offers tools for interactive visualisation of objects to motivate users to virtually visit objects and places. In this paper the generation of a virtual 3D model of the Selimiye mosque in the city of Edirne, Turkey and its processing for data integration into the game engine Unity is presented. The project has been carried out as a co-operation between BIMTAS, a company of the Greater Municipality of Istanbul, Turkey and the Photogrammetry & Laser Scanning Lab of the HafenCity University Hamburg, Germany to demonstrate an immersive and interactive visualisation using the new VR system HTC Vive. The workflow from data acquisition to VR visualisation, including the necessary programming for navigation, is described. Furthermore, the possible use (including simultaneous multiple users environments) of such a VR visualisation for a CH monument is discussed in this contribution.

AD  - Getty Vocabulary Program, Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles, CA, United States
AB  - This paper focuses on issues surrounding the rich content of the Getty vocabularies, [1] particularly as they have transitioned from more traditional data releases to become optimized for release as LOD and beyond. The Getty vocabularies have been a mainstay of cataloging, indexing, and access for art, architecture, and other cultural heritage information since the 1980s. They are compiled resources that grow through contributions from the expert user community. They are multicultural and multilingual, currently being translated in several languages. With the release of the AAT (Art Architecture Thesaurus®), ULAN (Union List of Artist Names ®), and TGN (Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names®) as Linked Open Data (LOD), [2] the Getty vocabularies are entering a new world of seemingly limitless possibilities in digital scholarship. With the addition of new resources, CONA (Cultural Objects Name Authority®) and the Getty Iconography Authority (IA), the Getty vocabularies are poised to truly become linchpins in joining disparate resources from diverse disciplines, including art museums, special collections, libraries, archives, conservation, archaeology, visual resources, universities, and other researchers. The Getty vocabularies may serve as conduits through which data about art, architecture, and other cultural heritage are created and accessed for research and discovery. From their inception, the Getty vocabularies were designed to be linkable to each other and to the broader realm of cultural heritage information. For example, in the AAT, concepts are linked to each other through hierarchical and associative relationships with defined relationship types that inform the user that a rhyta (http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300198841) is a type of ancient drinking vessel having an animal shape and is distinguished from vessels in other cultures having a similar purpose or appearance, such as stirrup cups and sturzbechers. In ULAN, the record for a person such as Katsushika Hokusai (http://vocab.getty.edu/page/ulan/500060426) may include various go names and aliases, and links to records for his teachers, family, and a novelist with whom he collaborated. In TGN, a geographic place record for Siena (http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/7011179) may include ancient names, as well as links to multiple broader hierarchical contexts, for the modern nation of Italy as well as the ancient confederation of states, Etruria. In the IA, an Aztec character Ometecuhtli (http://vocab.getty.edu/page/ia/901002056) may be linked to named legends in which he is a character, as well as to other characters or places to which he is related. In CONA, titles/names and other information for works of art, including architecture, movable works (paintings, sculptures, textiles), and conceptual works (multiples) are linked to AAT, ULAN, TGN, IA and external sources, linking rich information from multiple sources to describe works whether extant, destroyed, or designed but never built. An example is the Old Trikuta temple (http://vocab.getty.edu/page/cona/700002003). © 2018 Pacific Neighborhood Consortium (PNC).

AB  - With the advancement of instrument precision, research facilities are generating data at an unprecedented rate. These experimental results are stored in a digital library platform which the contents are later accessible from within the facility or the public. However, the sheer volume of collected data is overwhelming the capacity of researchers and impedes the process of browsing for the desired data. In this paper, we present a concept of Digital Visual Exploration Library (DVEL) based on the confluence of two major research domains-digital library and visualisation-that enables efficient browsing of the growing data within a digital library. We complement the current state-of-the-art textual metadata description by integrating visual exploration to address big complex data, i.e., data of large size, multimodal data and multivariate data. We describe our concept based on use cases from three unique domains: climate research with Doppler wind lidar, X-ray-imaging for entomology research, and medical imaging with ultrasound computer tomography. © 2018 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - With the rapid development of the Internet, people often communicate with others through social networking platforms, where a large number of user relationships are formed. Microblog is one of the most popular social networking platforms. Therefore, this paper attempts to mine user information in Microblog and analyze the relationship between users. This paper mainly uses Python and Selenium to launch the browser and simulate the operation of the mouse, such as login and browse. Then, the names and links of the Microblog user's followers are crawled. After crawling enough user information, a knowledge graph showing the user relationship is drawn by Python Networkx library. The experimental result shows that the knowledge graph can display the Microblog user relationship well through a directed graph. Readers can intuitively obtain the information of a certain Microblog user's followers from the graph. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Cultural heritage institutions such as archives, libraries, and museums have the mission of curating and safeguarding societal memories. The patrimonialization and curatorial processes developed by such institutions are continuous value-adding activities. Such institutions are beginning to publish their collections as digital objects on the Web. The representation and publication of cultural heritage records as digital objects using LOD—linked open data—technologies is a new step in patrimonialization and curatorial practices. Many collections are thematically superimposed, complementary, and have synergy. These collections often present culturally relevant relationships between their objects, like a book about a painting or a draft or sketch of a famous painting, etc. This research aims at characterizing such culturally relevant relationships, compiling an inventory, and organizing them in a vocabulary. The implementation of semantic links using LOD technologies can achieve interoperability between digital collections and improve the usability of digital collections, thus empowering heritage institutions. © 2018 International Society for Knowledge Organization.

AB  - Cultural heritage institutions have recently started to explore the added value of sharing their data, using Linked Open Data to integrate and enrich metadata of their collections. The catalogue of the Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes contains about 200,000 records which were transformed to RDF triples employing basically the RDA vocabulary (Resource Description and Access) to describe the entities. However, further refinements are needed for the recognition and extraction of implicit relationships expressed in natural language, such as geographic locations and dates. In order to facilitate literature researchers in carrying out sophisticated location-based searches, a web-based prototype is proposed. The usability of this web interface were evaluated in a user-based study, the results of which are also reported. The methods applied for the automation of the enrichment process, which build upon open-source software components, are described here. © 2017 ACM.

AB  - Based on current trends in the domain of Cultural Heritage promotion, visitors seek to engage in exceptional and unique experiences beyond established visiting practices. Meanwhile, the latest developments in information and communication facilitate access to cultural databases and repositories, bringing out the potential of new cultural products and services. In this direction, a variety of typologies and visitor categorizations have been developed that however do not take into account the complexity of visitors' demands and motivations, or that visitors tend to experience a journey based on new technologies and social media. Semantic Web technologies could be the key for designing personalized services, among other things, facilitating data interoperability in different repositories, making possible the correlation of data with different visitor profiles. In this context, Intelligent Interaction research group works towards an innovative approach that will enrich and enhance the experience of the modern cultural visitor. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

AB  - There exist many digital collections of cultural and historical resources, referred to as digital archives in this paper. Domains of digital archives are expanding from traditional cultural heritage objects to new areas such as popular culture and intangible entities. Though it is known that metadata models and authority records, such as subject vocabularies, are essential in building digital archives, they are not yet well established in these new domains. Another crucial issue is semantic linking among resources within a digital archive and across digital archives. Metadata aggregation is an essential aspect for the resource linking. This paper overviews three metadata-centric on-going research projects by the authors and discusses some lessons learned from them. The subject domains of these research projects are disaster records of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, Japanese popular culture such as Manga, Anime and Games, and cultural heritage resources in South and Southeast Asia. The main goal of this paper is not to report on these projects as completed research, but to discuss issues of metadata models and aggregation which are important in organizing digital archives in the web-based information environment. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

AB  - Recent advances in contemporary Virtual Reality (VR) technologies are going to have a significant impact on everyday life. Through VR it is possible to virtually explore a computer-generated environment as a different reality, and to immerse oneself into the past or in other virtual environments without leaving the current real-life situation. Cultural heritage (CH) monuments are ideally suited both for thorough multi-dimensional geometric documentation and for realistic interactive visualisation in immersive VR applications. Furthermore, VR is increasingly in use for virtual locations to enhance a visitor’s experience by providing access to additional materials for review and deepening knowledge either before or after the real visit. Using today’s available 3D technologies a virtual place is no longer just a presentation of geometric environments on the Internet or a virtual tour of the place using panoramic photography. Additionally, the game industry offers tools for interactive visualisation of objects to motivate users to virtually visit objects and places. This paper presents the generation of virtual 3D models for different cultural heritage monuments and their processing for data integration into the two game engines Unity and Unreal. The workflow from data acquisition to VR visualisation using the VR system HTC Vive, including the necessary programming for navigation and interactions, is described. Furthermore, the use (including simultaneous use of multiple end-users) of such a VR visualisation for CH monuments is discussed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - Researchers spend a lot of time on finding information about people, events, journals, and research areas related to topics of their interest. Digital libraries and digital scholarly repositories usually offer services to assist researchers in this task. However, every research community has its own way of distributing scholarly metadata. Mailing lists provide an instantaneous channel and are often used for discussing topics of interest to a community of researchers, or to announce important information - albeit in an unstructured way. To bring structure specifically into the announcements of events and thus to enable researchers to, e.g., filter them by relevance, we present a semi-automatic crowd-sourcing workflow that captures metadata of events from call-for-papers emails into the OpenResearch.org semantic wiki. Evaluations confirm that our approach reduces the high number of actions that researchers currently have to perform manually when tracing calls for papers received via mailing lists. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - The catalogue of the Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes contains about 200,000 records which were originally created in compliance with the MARC21 standard. The entries in the catalogue have been recently migrated to a new relational database whose data model adheres to the conceptual models promoted by the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA), in particular, to the FRBR and FRAD specifications. The database content has been later mapped, by means of an automated procedure, to RDF triples which employ basically the RDA vocabulary (Resource Description and Access) to describe the entities, as well as their properties and relationships. This RDF-based semantic description of the catalogue is now accessible online through an interface which supports browsing and searching the information. Due to their open nature, these public data can be easily linked and used for new applications created by external developers and institutions. The methods applied for the automation of the conversion, which build upon open-source software components, are described here. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent efforts towards digitization of cultural heritage artifacts have resulted in a surge of information around these artifacts. However, the organization of these artifacts falls short with respect to accessing the facts across these entities. In this paper, we present a method to harvest the knowledge and form a knowledge graph from the digitized artifacts in the Museums of India repository via distant supervision to enable better accessibility of the facts and ability to extract new insights around the artifacts. Triples extracted from an open information extractor are first canonicalized to a standard taxonomy based on a metric-based scoring. Since a standard taxonomy is insufficient to capture all the relationships, we propose a sequential clustering based approach to add artifact specific relationships to the taxonomy (and to the knowledge graph). The graph is enriched by inferring missing facts based on a probabilistic soft logic approach seeded from a frequent item set framework. Human evaluation of the final knowledge graph showed an accuracy of 75% on par with knowledge bases like DBpedia. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Cultural heritage institutions store and manage large volumes of historical information, that have great material and humanitarian value. Their means of data organization, often obsolete, hinders the dissemination and reuse of information to be made in an effective way. In this sense, an application of Linked Open Data (LOD) technology is the possibility to extend the knowledge of a collection, with the use of open data already consolidated on the web to describe artworks or any type of physical object. This paper introduces a generic architecture based on an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) methodology that connects LOD data from cultural heritage available on the web, generates descriptive content for physical objects and provides the mapping of research institutes engaged in studying them, highlighting their collaboration network. For instance, an implementation of the architecture was dedicated to the domain of Botany and can assist herbarium managers in creating exhibitions about medicinal plants. In this paper, we present a software architecture that provides an automatic method for creating dynamic pages from data stored in interconnected databases, and an application, which supports visitation systems with visualization and interaction mechanisms to encourage visitor learning. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - In this demo we present a tool for visual question answering (QA) over the Wikidata knowledge graph based on diagrammatic representation and reasoning. The demo is built on top of the metaphacts platform with the Ontodia library embedded. In a user study, we demonstrate and evaluate the approach of diagrammatic question answering using questions from the QALD7 (Question Answering over Linked Data) benchmark for Wikidata. The effectiveness and limitations of the proposed approach are discussed in the evaluation and conclusions sections. In the demo session at ESWC, we plan to present our tool for visual QA and show its QA capabilities using incremental creation of diagrams. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Nowadays, the development of information technology both in terms of hardware and software has been growing rapidly. Many people used technology to search many types of information. On the other hand, there are information on Sundanese ancient manuscript as cultural heritage with many valuable information still accessed manually, such as the manuscript which located in Situs Kabuyutan Ciburuy, Garut, Jawa Barat. Many people with many purposes (i.e. Research, education, etc.) came to access directly. Its becoming a problem because due to lack of maintainability, the manuscripts became fragile. Furthermore, the information will be lost. So, the emergency solution should be proposed to preserve this valuable heritage. We proposed a retrieval system using the probability approach that can be effective for search the information in ancient Sundanese language. The two probability approaches: Bayesian Networks and Divergence form Randomness have been compared. The 50 queries for three different types of structured query have been run and evaluated by Mean Average Precision (MAP). The results give that the effective methods come from Bayesian Network. There is another finding during the building process of retrieval system. The interactive visualization can be delivered by the retrieval system according to the given query. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - A large number of cultural heritage archives are freely available on the web: they can be in Linked Open data format, or in any other format, such as databases, collections or archives, with some information for each object. To be really enjoyed and enjoyable by the users on the web, a set of scored keywords need to be associated with each item, manually or automatically. The overall problem here addressed is the automatic, unsupervised extraction of keywords/keyphrases from the items of cultural heritage archives, in different languages (English and Italian). The problem is very actual and in literature many papers are devoted to this topic and several approaches have been defined: we present here a work-in-progress, an experimentation done with the aim of automatically associating scored keywords/keyphrases to a painting archive. We have therefore tested five different methods present in literature, such as tf-idf, RAKE, TextRank, ..., on two datasets, in English and in Italian, and evaluated the results - using recall and precision@n as the evaluation metrics. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Open-Source Projects and Libraries are being used in software development while also bearing multiple security vulnerabilities. This use of third party ecosystem creates a new kind of attack surface for a product in development. An intelligent attacker can attack a product by exploiting one of the vulnerabilities present in linked projects and libraries.In this paper, we mine threat intelligence about open source projects and libraries from bugs and issues reported on public code repositories. We also track library and project dependencies for installed software on a client machine. We represent and store this threat intelligence, along with the software dependencies in a security knowledge graph. Security analysts and developers can then query and receive alerts from the knowledge graph if any threat intelligence is found about linked libraries and projects, utilized in their products. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - While existing Linked Datasets provide detailed representations of Cultural Heritage objects, the locations where the objects originate from is often not accurately represented. Countries, municipalities, and excavation sites are commonly represented by geospatial points, and the fact that countries and municipalities change their geometry over time is not reflected in the data. We present nlGis, a collection of existing geo-historic datasets that are now published as Linked Open Data. The datasets in nlGis contain detailed geographic information about historic regions, with an emphasis on the Netherlands. We describe the creation of this Linked Geodataset and how it can be used to enrich Cultural Heritage data. We also distill several 'lessons learned' that can guide future attempts at publishing detailed Linked Geodata in the Cultural Heritage domain. © 2018 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

AB  - CIDOC CRM is an ontology intended to facilitate the integration, mediation and interchange of heterogeneous cultural heritage information. The Semantic Web with its Linked Open Data cloud enables scholars and cultural institutions to publish their data in RDF, using CIDOC CRM as an interlingua that enables a semantically consistent re-interpretation of their data. Nowadays more and more projects have done the task of mapping legacy datasets to CIDOC CRM, and successful Extract-Transform-Load data-integration processes have been performed in this way. A next step is enabling people and applications to actually dynamically explore autonomous datasets using the semantic mediation offered by CIDOC CRM. This is the purpose of OpenArchaeo, a tool for querying archaeological datasets on the LOD cloud. We present its main features: the principles behind its user friendly query interface and its SPARQL Endpoint for programs, together with its overall architecture designed to be extendable and scalable, for handling transparent interconnections with evolving distributed sources while achieving good efficiency. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed the development of various techniques and tools for the building code-compliance of IFC models. Indeed these are great efforts, but, still there is a gap for the fully automatic building code-compliance. This paper presents our research and development of Semantic BIM Reasoner (SBIM-Reasoner) which employs semantic technologies to meet the requirements of semantic verification of an IFC model. SBIM-Reasoner employs several preprocessors (IFC to RDF converter, Geometry Extractor) to build the semantic repository from the input IFC model. Once all the triples are generated from the initial data (.ifc file), Stardog is used to build a knowledge graph for the semantic verification. All types of inference and reasoning mechanisms for the semantic verification are applied over this knowledge graph to meet the requirements of verification. Knowledge graph over triplets enables freedom of extending RDF based Semantic IFC model, creation of newer vocabulary and formation of newer rules, concatenation of triplets to build rules with condition and constraints over IFC data, dynamic reasoning over the triplets based on the initial data of IFC model, etc. Finally, we tested our prototype by using several online IFC models. We conclude that semantic technologies provide more rich mechanisms and answer vast types of queries for the verification of IFC models. It provides powerful features based on SPARQL libraries and serves best for the automated code compliance and verification of IFC models. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

AB  - Process mining focuses on extracting knowledge, under the form of models, from data generated and stored in information systems. The analysis of generated models can provide useful insights to domain experts. In addition, models of processes can be used to test if a considered process complies with some given specifications. For these reasons, process mining is gaining significant importance in the healthcare domain, where the complexity and flexibility of processes makes extremely hard to evaluate and assess how patients have been treated. In this paper we describe how pMineR, an R library designed and developed for performing process mining in the medical domain, is currently exploited in Hospitals for supporting domain experts in the analysis of the extracted knowledge models. In its current release, pMineR can encode extracted processes under the form of directed graphs, which are easy to interpret and understand by experts of the domain. It also provides graphical comparison between different processes, allows to model the adherence to a given clinical guidelines and to estimate performance and the workload of the available resources in healthcare. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM) sector deals with complex and varied data. Integrating that data, especially across institutions, has always been a challenge. Semantic data integration is the best approach to deal with such challenges. Linked Open Data (LOD) enable large-scale Digital Humanities (DH) research, collaboration and aggregation, allowing DH researchers to make connections between (and make sense of) the multitude of digitized Cultural Heritage (CH) available on the web. An upsurge of interest in semtech and LOD has swept the CH and DH communities. An active Linked Open Data for Libraries, Archives and Museums (LODLAM) community exists, CH data is published as LOD, and international collaborations have emerged. The value of LOD is especially high in the GLAM sector, since culture by its very nature is cross-border and interlinked. We present interesting LODLAM projects, datasets, and ontologies, as well as Ontotext's experience in this domain. An extended version of this paper is available. It has 77 pages, 67 figures, detailed info about CH content and XML standards, Wikidata and global authority control. © 2017 Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Mathematics and Informatics.

AB  - Background: Identifying new potential treatment options for medical conditions that cause human disease burden is a central task of biomedical research. Since all candidate drugs cannot be tested with animal and clinical trials, in vitro approaches are first attempted to identify promising candidates. Likewise, identifying different causal relations between biomedical entities is also critical to understand biomedical processes. Generally, natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning are used to predict specific relations between any given pair of entities using the distant supervision approach. Objective: To build high accuracy supervised predictive models to predict previously unknown treatment and causative relations between biomedical entities based only on semantic graph pattern features extracted from biomedical knowledge graphs. Methods: We used 7000 treats and 2918 causes hand-curated relations from the UMLS Metathesaurus to train and test our models. Our graph pattern features are extracted from simple paths connecting biomedical entities in the SemMedDB graph (based on the well-known SemMedDB database made available by the U.S. National Library of Medicine). Using these graph patterns connecting biomedical entities as features of logistic regression and decision tree models, we computed mean performance measures (precision, recall, F-score) over 100 distinct 80–20% train-test splits of the datasets. For all experiments, we used a positive:negative class imbalance of 1:10 in the test set to model relatively more realistic scenarios. Results: Our models predict treats and causes relations with high F-scores of 99% and 90% respectively. Logistic regression model coefficients also help us identify highly discriminative patterns that have an intuitive interpretation. We are also able to predict some new plausible relations based on false positives that our models scored highly based on our collaborations with two physician co-authors. Finally, our decision tree models are able to retrieve over 50% of treatment relations from a recently created external dataset. Conclusions: We employed semantic graph patterns connecting pairs of candidate biomedical entities in a knowledge graph as features to predict treatment/causative relations between them. We provide what we believe is the first evidence in direct prediction of biomedical relations based on graph features. Our work complements lexical pattern based approaches in that the graph patterns can be used as additional features for weakly supervised relation prediction. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We have developed low cost interactive 3D models that improve access to architectural details of cultural sites for all, including people with vision impairments. Our approach uses rapid prototyping and 3D printing along with a very small single-board computer for automating user interaction. As a case study, we developed a prototype model of "Piazza dei Miracoli" (Pisa, Italy), the famous square where the Leaning Tower is located. The system is a combination of tactile information with audio descriptions to enable potential users to explore the artifact autonomously. We exploited low-cost and partially open-source technologies, thus rendering our system easily replicable. We evaluated the interactive system with a group of eight completely blind and partially sighted users. Our user test confirmed the validity of our approach: (1) the three-dimensional models and the tactile reproduction of details obtained via a low-cost 3D printing solution are well perceived by touch; (2) the semantic aural information activated via perceptible buttons on demand and the different content levels for the audio tracks are suitable for an interactive, autonomous and satisfying exploration. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - ResearchSpace is an open source platform designed at the British Museum to help establish a community of researchers, where their underlying activities are framed by data sharing, active engagement in formal arguments, and semantic publishing. Using Semantic Web languages and technologies, the innovations of the system are shaped by a social conceptualisation of the graph-based representation of information. This is employed by integrated semantic components aimed at subject experts that offer mechanisms to create, annotate, assert, argue, search, cite, and justify data-driven research. This paper showcases a new onto-epistemological approach that supports researchers to contribute to a growing and sustainable corpus of knowledge that has history, not just provenance, built-in. It describes our considerations in designing for interdisciplinary collaboration, usability and trust in the digital space, highlighted by use cases in archaeology, art history, and history of science. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - A formal machine reader is a tool able to transform natural language text into formal structured knowledge so as the latter can be interpreted by machines, according to a shared semantics. FRED is a formal machine reader for the semantic web: its output is a RDF/OWL graph, whose design is based on frame semantics. FRED's graph are domain- and task-independent, making the tool suitable to be used as a semantic middleware for domain- or task-specific applications. To serve this purpose, it is available both as REST service and as Python library. This paper provides details about FRED's capabilities, design issues, implementation and evaluation. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - The extent of cultural heritage in digital format requires the creation of tools designed to improve access to and to enhance the added value deriving from the intersection of data originated in heterogeneous environments. Within an aggregational portal, cross-domain navigation is a particularly critical issue given the wide spectrum of criteria to which data and digital objects conform. Furthermore, data models supporting interoperability, such as Dublin Core, have a flat structure and a reduced granularity, thus contributing to the loss of information as well as to the decontextualization of the objects. Adopting the same format and descriptive rules for all classes of materials, a practical solution implemented by many English speaking countries in the last decade of the 20th century, is no longer an option. Much more feasible appears nowadays the creation of more complex data models, as in the case of Europeana Data Model, or the implementation of clustering strategies, such as in VIAF. In perspective, the Linked Open Data option appears quite promising. Based on the experience of BeWeb, the portal created and coordinated by the National Office for the Ecclesiastical Cultural Heritage (UNBCE) of the Italian Catholic Bishops’ Conference (CEI) to provide access to its many databases, authority data can be successfully used to bring together information provided by different sources. Data clustering appears to be a viable strategy for the purpose of preserving the quality of the original description and providing the user with a more accurate context information. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Software engineering social content, such as Q&A discussions on Stack Overflow, has become a wealth of information on software engineering. This textual content is centered around software-specific entities, and their usage patterns, issues-solutions, and alternatives. However, existing approaches to analyzing software engineering texts treat software-specific entities in the same way as other content, and thus cannot support the recent advance of entity-centric applications, such as direct answers and knowledge graph. The first step towards enabling these entity-centric applications for software engineering is to recognize and classify software-specific entities, which is referred to as Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the literature. Existing NER methods are designed for recognizing person, location and organization in formal and social texts, which are not applicable to NER in software engineering. Existing information extraction methods for software engineering are limited to API identification and linking of a particular programming language. In this paper, we formulate the research problem of NER in software engineering. We identify the challenges in designing a software-specific NER system and propose a machine learning based approach applied on software engineering social content. Our NER system, called S-NER, is general for software engineering in that it can recognize a broad category of software entities for a wide range of popular programming languages, platform, and library. We conduct systematic experiments to evaluate our machine learning based S-NER against a well-designed rule-based baseline system, and to study the effectiveness of widely-adopted NER techniques and features in the face of the unique characteristics of software engineering social content. © 2016 IEEE

AB  - Linked Open Data (LOD) has been a focus of great interest in the library and information science literature in recent years. Much of the literature in this area has been in explaining concepts and discussing its applicability to library data. Implementation of LOD is based on concepts that differ from those of more traditional databases and records. This adds a certain level of complexity to an understanding of its application in practice. As a relatively new topic, the library literature lacks best practices for implementing LOD. The goal of this paper is to share with the readers the challenges faced by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) LOD project team in implementing the transformation of digitalcollection metadata into LOD and the solutions that were adopted. The author briefly introduces basic concepts of LOD and explains, step-by-step, how to transform digital-collections metadata into LOD, thereby indicating the open source technologies and data model that might be considered as tools for such a transformation. The project is in its final phase of implementation. Lessons learned so far will be of great value for those who are planning to pursue such an endeavor. Prior experience by the author in leading a hands-on workshop on LOD indicates that as attendees perform practical tasks for generating triples (statements) from metadata, their understanding of LOD and its potential benefits are consolidated. This paper is organized in such a way as to accomplish this same objective. © Silvia B. Southwick.

AB  - The most straightforward method for heart beat estimation is R-peak detection based on an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. Current R-peak detection methods do not work properly when the ECG signal is contaminated or missing, which leads to the incorrect estimation of the heart rate. This raises the need for reliable algorithms which can locate heart beats in continuous long-term multimodal data, allowing robust analysis. In this paper, three peak detectors are evaluated for heart beat detection using various cardiovascular signals. One of the peak detectors is a new general peak detector (GPD) algorithm which is applicable on ECG and other pulsatile signals to compensate for the limitation of QRS detection. This peak detector algorithm is adaptive and independently finds amplitude characteristics for every recording, while not tuned for ECG or other pulsatile signals. Three strategies, which are different disciplines of detectors, are then proposed while the fusion method remains the same in all strategies. In the first strategy, the ECG and the lowest-indexed signal of general blood pressure (BP), arterial blood pressure (ART) and pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) are processed through gqrs and wabp (from the PhysioNet library), respectively. In the second strategy, all beats in different signals are detected by GPD. In the third strategy, ECG and other signals are processed by gqrs and GPD, respectively. In all three strategies two criteria are used in order to fuse the detections. The first criterion is based on the number of candidate detections in a specific time period, based on which signals of interest are selected. The second fusion criterion is based on the regularity of the derived intervals between subsequent candidate detections. If the number of detections in ECG and one of BP, ART and PAP signals have reasonable physiological range, a new signal is generated in which they are coupled with each other. Heart beats can more easily be detected in noisy parts of these signals using the new coupled waveform. For instance, if ECG and BP are coupled, BP pulses make the real heart beats in noisy parts of ECG detectable and ECG R-peaks make the weak BP pulses detectable in the new waveform. The proposed peak detector is developed using the MIT/BIH arrhythmia database. Furthermore, heart beat detection strategies were evaluated using the train and test datasets of PhysioNet/CinC Challenge (2014), and the overall results of the strategies are compared. © 2015 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

AB  - Drawing upon research and current development work at Europeana, this paper discusses search functionality in the Cultural Heritage sector, focusing in particular on the question of ‘inspiration-oriented’ search, in which users seek out previously-unknown items to serve as creative stimulus. Inspiration-oriented search is identified as a variant of the more widely-studied problem of serendipitous retrieval, and defined as an information-seeking behavior in which users consciously search for items that are related to known items in ways that are recognizable once seen, but that are nevertheless unpredictable at search-time. Various strategies for the maximization of both the recognisability and unpredictability of related items are then described, including user-interface and user-experience changes and the reconceptualization of datastores as knowledge graphs. Directions for further research are then outlined – including, most importantly, possible metrics for inspiration-oriented search and their potential for use in machine-learning ranking frameworks.

AB  - Musicological knowledge is spread between the lines of thousands of texts stored in hundreds of music libraries. Technology, and more recently semantic technologies, may play a key role in the way information is retrieved. In this article, an analysis of the evolution of music digital libraries from a technological perspective is presented. Then, a methodology to exploit implicit knowledge present in collections of text documents is proposed. The described methodology is applied over a set of 16,707 artist biographies gathered from Grove Music Online. A knowledge graph is then created after applying a process of information extraction. Several insights are extracted from the data to illustrate the possibilities of the proposed methodology for musicologists. Finally, an extension of the methodology is proposed to combine different data sources, and illustrated with the creation of a flamenco music knowledge base.

AB  - In contrast with other imaging modalities, there is presently a scarcity of fully open resources in magnetoencephalography (MEG) available to the neuroimaging community. Here we present a collaborative effort led by the McConnell Brain Imaging Centre of the Montreal Neurological Institute, and the Université de Montréal to build and share a centralised repository to curate MEG data in raw and processed form for open dissemination. The Open MEG Archive (OMEGA, omega.bic.mni.mcgill.ca) is bound to become a continuously expanding repository of multimodal data with a primary focus on MEG, in addition to storing anatomical MRI volumes, demographic participant data and questionnaires, and other forms of electrophysiological data such as EEG. The OMEGA initiative offers both the technological framework for multi-site MEG data aggregation, and serves as one of the largest freely available resting-state and eventually task-related MEG datasets presently available. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..

AB  - This paper describes the ontology model and published datasets of a digitized biographical person register. The applied ontology model is designed to represent people via their enduring roles and perduring lifetime events. The model is designed to support 1) prosopographical Digital Humanities research, 2) linking to resources in semantic Cultural Heritage portals, and 3) semantic data validation and enrichment by using SPARQL queries. The linked data approach enables to enrich a person's biography by interlinking it with space and time related biographical events, persons relating by social contacts or family relations, historical events, and personal achievements.

AB  - With the rapid development of the Internet and the explosion of data volume, it is important to access the cross-media big data including text, image, audio, and video, etc., efficiently and accurately. However, the content hetero- geneity and semantic gap make it challenging to retrieve such cross-media archives. The existing approaches try to learn the connection between multiple modalities by direct utilization of hand-crafted low-level features, and the learned correlations are merely constructed with high-level feature representations without considering semantic information. To further exploit the intrinsic structures of multimodal data representations, it is essential to build up an interpretable correlation between these heterogeneous representations. In this paper, a deep model is proposed to first learn the high-level feature representation shared by different modalities like texts and images, with convolutional neural network (CNN). Moreover, the learned CNN features can reflect the salient objects as well as the details in the images and sentences. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art base methods on public dataset of Flickr8K. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Expert finding and the identification of similar profebionals are important tasks for many services provided by companies and in-stitutions. Nowadays, the rapid growth of web services and social and profebional networks, allowed different kind of users to share personal data and increased the amount of information available. Most of re-search works focus on a limited set of users, characterized by the same kind of main activities, e.g., researchers, or exploit external knowledge, such as predefined ontologies. An heterogeneous environment, with pos-sible lack of information, and not well structured data, puts forward new challenges, to addreb the problem of adapting user profiling and consequently expert search. In this paper, we first provide a general per-spective on studies on expert finding, similar people identification and social recommender systems, highlighting some critical ibues related to information extraction and user profile definition. We then present a first attempt to create an expert search system to support users in Library and Archiving Communities, such as researchers, students, authors, in the field of Textbook Research, in finding other experts to get in contact with or to start a cooperation. This is organized in three phases: first, we collect information about users in order to build structured profiles; then, we build a Community Knowledge Graph (CKG) which defines relationships and weights among terms that occur in the profile sections, emphasizing information shared by users in the entire analyzed commu-nity. As third step, we exploit the CKG structure to define similarity values among users based on weights got by their common terms in the CKG, and their distances in the graph. We conjecture that the CKG allows to model users emphasizing new semantic aspects of relationships among profile elements, and helps to improve the similarity computation and the expert search. We present a preliminar experimental evaluation on real users.

AB  - In the last decade, Europe has put a tremendous effort into making cultural, educational and scientific resources publicly available. Based on national or thematic aggregators, initiatives like Europeana nowadays provide a plethora of cultural resources for people worldwide. Although such massive amounts of rich cultural heritage content are available, the potential of its use for educational and scientific purposes still remains largely untapped. Much valuable content is only available in the so-called long tail, i.e. in niche resources such as specifically themed cultural heritage collections, and are difficult to access from the mainstream hubs like major search engines, social networks or online encyclopaedias. The vision of the EEXCESS project is to push high-quality content from the long tail to platforms and devices which are used every day. The realisation of such use cases requires as a basis (and in addition to the functional components) a common metadata representation and tools for mapping between the data sources’ specific data models and this common representation. In this paper, we propose a data model for such a system that combines federated search results from different cultural heritage data sources. We then propose an approach for metadata mapping, with a focus on easy configurability of mappings, which—once properly configured—can then be executed on the fly by an automatic service. We demonstrate the approach using a real-world example. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Through a case study of using social media tools to open up part of the curatorial research process for an online exhibit on the history of astronomy at the Library of Congress, I offer some initial ideas about how an open approach to sharing curatorial research could significantly expand the impact and reach of such work. Drawing on three distinct emerging conceptions and frameworks for the idea of “open” (open notebook science, linked open data, and open innovation) I suggest how this case study can be used to guide work with existing simple and inexpensive tools and how it could also inform the development of future tools, services and exhibit development methods. This work builds on an ongoing discussion of open data in libraries, archives, and museums. To date, most of that dialog is about object records and not about the stories and narratives cultural heritage institutions tell about them. I suggest ways to make the production of cultural heritage data, as well as the final outputs, part of an open and transparent process. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Flood event monitoring plays an important role for emergency management. With the fast growth of social media, a large number of images and videos are uploaded and searched on the internet during disasters, which can be used as 'sensors' for improving efficiency of emergency management. This work proposes a novel framework in which the rich information available from social media is incorporated with image analysis to enhance image retrieval for disaster management. The text associated with images of flooding events was used to extract prominent words associated with flooding. The image features are represented by a histogram of visual words obtained using the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model. The text and image analysis are integrated at the feature level, in which the text features are conjoined directly with image features. The proposed approach was evaluated based on two flood event corpuses obtained from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency media library and public Facebook pages and groups related to flood and flood aid (in German). The experimental results demonstrate the improved performance of image recognition after incorporating the text features, which suggests the potential to enhance the efficiency of emergency management. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Knowledge graph management use cases often require addressing hybrid information needs that involve multitude of data sources, multitude of data modalities (e.g., structured, keyword, geospatial search), and availability of computation services (e.g., machine learning and graph analytics algorithms). Although SPARQL queries provide a convenient way of expressing data requests over RDF knowledge graphs, the level of support for hybrid information needs is limited: existing query engines usually focus on retrieving RDF data and only support a set of hard-coded built-in services. In this paper we describe representative use cases of metaphacts in the cultural heritage and pharmacy domains and the hybrid information needs arising in them. To address these needs, we present Ephedra: a SPARQL federation engine aimed at processing hybrid queries. Ephedra provides a flexible declarative mechanism for including hybrid services into a SPARQL federation and implements a number of static and runtime query optimization techniques for improving the hybrid SPARQL queries performance. We validate Ephedra in the use case scenarios and discuss practical implications of hybrid query processing. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - Third-party libraries are an integral part of many software projects. It often happens that developers need to find analogical libraries that can provide comparable features to the libraries they are already familiar with. Existing methods to find analogical libraries are limited by the community-curated list of libraries, blogs, or Q&A posts, which often contain overwhelming or out-of-date information. In this paper, we present a new approach to recommend analogical libraries based on a knowledge base of analogical libraries mined from tags of millions of Stack Overflow questions. The novelty of our approach is to solve analogical-libraries questions by combining state-of-the-art word embedding technique and domain-specific relational and categorical knowledge mined from Stack Overflow. We implement our approach in a proof-of-concept web application (https://graphofknowledge.appspot.com/similartech). The evaluation results show that our approach can make accurate recommendation of analogical libraries (Precision@1=0.81 and Precision@5=0.67). Google Analytics of the website traffic provides initial evidence of the potential usefulness of our web application for software developers. © 2016 IEEE

AB  - This paper applies the Levels of Conceptual Interoperability Model to a case study of two cultural heritage institutions with disparate but related collections in an effort to define a maturity model for interoperability between presentations of digitized cultural heritage materials. The Levels of Conceptual Interoperability Model (LCIM) is a progressive model developed by Dr. Andreas Tolk within the field of Modeling and Simulation and systems engineering to be used in determining potential for interoperability between systems. This paper applies the LCIM through a descriptive model to a digital library ecosystem that includes digital collections, digital libraries, and meta-aggregators. This paper seeks to determine if this model is sufficient as a method of measuring the potential for interoperation between systems, metadata, and collections within a digital cultural heritage ecosystem. A maturity model for interoperability within a digital library ecosystem can aid metadata operations specialists in determining the potential for interoperability between systems and collections.

AB  - The conduct of multicenter studies in the field of radiation therapy and oncology is one of the key prerequisites for stimulating translational research and accelerating the application of healthcare innovations into day to day patient treatment. To effectively run such studies, the participating research institutions need access to radiotherapy-specific information technology (IT), which enables collection of case report forms (eCRFs) linked with medical imaging and treatment planning data. Existing commercial systems that provide multimodal data collection features may fit for industry funded clinical trials but do not consider academia needs for long-lasting and affordable IT infrastructure. This paper presents an alternative way for development of a sustainable clinical research IT platform based on open-source systems. The platform design is driven by an integration of its core components, namely, electronic data capture system (EDC), medical image archive (PACS), and patient identity management system (PIDG). Three deployment scenarios are described that allow setting up the platform in a central, virtually hosted or decentralized environment. The first production implementation of this infrastructure was established as RadiationDosePlan-Image/Biomarker-Outcome-platform (RadPlanBio) in September 2013. It is maintained by the German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Dresden and the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg. Until now, it manages 9 studies across 11 sites with 600 enrolled subjects. This paper shows how the integration of open-source systems can drive the development of sustainable clinical research IT environment supporting translational research projects in the field of radiation therapy and oncology. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Multispectral and hyperspectral images are well established in various fields of application like remote sensing, astronomy, and microscopic spectroscopy. In recent years, the availability of new sensor designs, more powerful processors, and high-capacity storage further opened this imaging modality to a wider array of applications like medical diagnosis, agriculture, and cultural heritage. This necessitates new tools that allow general analysis of the image data and are intuitive to users who are new to hyperspectral imaging. We introduce a novel framework that bundles new interactive visualization techniques with powerful algorithms and is accessible through an efficient and intuitive graphical user interface. We visualize the spectral distribution of an image via parallel coordinates with a strong link to traditional visualization techniques, enabling new paradigms in hyperspectral image analysis that focus on interactive raw data exploration. We combine novel methods for supervised segmentation, global clustering, and nonlinear false-color coding to assist in the visual inspection. Our framework coined Gerbil is open source and highly modular, building on established methods and being easily extensible for application-specific needs. It satisfies the need for a general, consistent software framework that tightly integrates analysis algorithms with an intuitive, modern interface to the raw image data and algorithmic results. Gerbil finds its worldwide use in academia and industry alike with several thousand downloads originating from 45 countries. © 2016 Johannes Jordan et al.

AB  - Purpose: Early Modern emblem books are primary sources for scholars studying the European Renaissance. Linked Open Data (LOD) is an approach for organizing and modeling information in a data-centric manner compatible with the emerging Semantic Web. The purpose of this paper is to examine ways in which LOD methods can be applied to facilitate emblem resource discovery, better reveal the structure and connectedness of digitized emblem resources, and enhance scholar interactions with digitized emblem resources. Design/methodology/approach: This research encompasses an analysis of the existing XML-based Spine (emblem-specific) metadata schema; the design of a new, domain-specific, Resource Description Framework compatible ontology; the mapping and transformation of metadata from Spine to both the new ontology and (separately) to the pre-existing Schema.org ontology; and the (experimental) modification of the Emblematica Online portal as a proof of concept to illustrate enhancements supported by LOD. Findings: LOD is viable as an approach for facilitating discovery and enhancing the value to scholars of digitized emblem books; however, metadata must first be enriched with additional uniform resource identifiers and the workflow upgrades required to normalize and transform existing emblem metadata are substantial and still to be fully worked out. Practical implications: The research described demonstrates the feasibility of transforming existing, special collections metadata to LOD. Although considerable work and further study will be required, preliminary findings suggest potential benefits of LOD for both users and libraries. Originality/value: This research is unique in the context of emblem studies and adds to the emerging body of work examining the application of LOD best practices to library special collections. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Storytelling in museum environments can be ‘materialized’ using print and visual media formats. The use of graphical visualization techniques improves the interpretation in a narrative context, hence helps to convey information and deliver a better understanding of a story. This research was prompted by the rising use of interactive visualization techniques for ‘storytelling’ in museum environments.

AB  - Three-dimensional content offers a powerful medium enabling rich, interactive visualization in virtual and augmented reality systems, which are increasingly used in a variety of application domains, such as education, training, tourism and cultural heritage. The creation of interactive 3D presentations is typically a complex process covering diverse aspects of the content such as geometry, structure, space, appearance, animation and behavior. Recent trends in the development of the semantic web provide new opportunities for simplifying 3D content creation, which may be performed at different levels of abstraction and may encompass the inference of hidden knowledge, which may influence the created content. However, the available approaches to 3D content creation do not enable conceptual knowledge-based modeling of 3D content. The main contribution of this paper is an approach to semantic creation of 3D content. The proposed solution leverages the semantic web techniques to enable conceptual, knowledge-driven content creation. The proposed approach has been implemented and evaluated. It has been shown that the approach can significantly simplify modeling of advanced 3D content presentations in comparison with the available approaches. © 2014, The Author(s).

AB  - This paper propose a metadata schema to preserve the semantics of cultural heritage (CH) objects. A widely used standard of CH metadata is already provide by CIDOC-CRM which has been approved as an ISO 21127 in 2006. However, mapping CH attributes to CIDOC-CRM entities needs to be done carefully since the metadata could be published as open data. In order to enrich the spatial information of CH objects, we linked the metadata with geographic features in open geographic dataset Geonames. In the experiment results, the metadata and open linked data seems to be successfully implemented and can be used to solve more specific query about CH objects relates to their spatio-temporal relationships. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Cultural heritage institutions have recently started to explore the added value of sharing their data, opening to initiatives that are using the Linked Open Data cloud to integrate and enrich metadata of their cultural heritage collections. However, each museum and each collection shows peculiarities, which make it difficult to generalize this process and offer one-size-fits-all solutions. In this paper, we report on the integration, enrichment and interlinking activities of metadata from a small collection of verbo-visual artworks in the context of the Verbo-Visual-Virtual project. We investigate how to exploit Semantic Web technologies and languages combined with natural language processing methods to transform and boost the access to documents providing cultural information, i.e., artist descriptions, collection notices, information about technique. We also discuss the open challenges raised by working with a small collection including little-known artists and information gaps, for which additional data can be hardly retrieved from the Web. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - This paper describes a part of the contribution of the CoMAS project (“In situ conservation planning of Underwater Archaeological Artifacts”), funded by the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR), and run by a partnership of private companies and public research centers. The CoMAS project aims at the development of new materials, techniques and tools for the documentation, conservation and restoration of underwater archaeological sites in their natural environment. This paper details the results achieved during the project in the development of an innovative electric tool, which can efficiently support the restorers’ work in their activities aimed to preserve the underwater cultural heritage in its original location on the seafloor. In particular, the paper describes the different steps to develop an underwater electric cleaning brush, which is able to perform a first rough cleaning of the submerged archaeological structures by removing the loose deposits and the various marine organisms that reside on their surface. The peculiarity of this work consists in a user centred design approach that tries to overcome the lack of detailed users’ requirements and the lack of norms and guidelines for the ergonomic assessment of such kind of underwater tools. The proposed approach makes a wide use of additive manufacturing techniques for the realization and modification of prototypes to be employed for insitu experimentation conducted with the final users. The user tests have been addressed to collect data for supporting the iterative development of the prototype. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - We present an interactive visualization system developed for the valorization of an extraordinary collection of protostoric Mediterranean sculptures, which depict models of buildings (cone-shaped stone towers), as well as larger-than-life human figures. The architecture is based on scalable components for efficient distribution and adaptive rendering of extremely detailed surface meshes, as well as a simple and effective interactive camera controller tailored for touch interaction. The user interface has been designed for targeting both small screens and large display systems, and in a way that casual users can easily and naturally explore the models with fast learning curves. Furthermore, a thumbnail-based point-of-interest selector enable users to explore 3D views with information presented as 2D overlays decorating the 3D scene. The system components have been integrated in different interactive applications, ranging from large-screen museal setups and low end mobile devices both with very high visual quality. The capabilities of the museal systems have been demonstrated in a variety of temporal and permanent exhibitions, where they have been extensively used by tens of thousands of visitors. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Over the last decades 3D modelling has been a fast growing field in Geographic Information Science, extensively applied in various domains including reconstruction and visualization of cultural heritage, especially monuments and traditional settlements. Technological advances in computer graphics, allow for modelling of complex 3D objects achieving high precision and accuracy. Procedural modelling is an effective tool and a relatively novel method, based on algorithmic modelling concept. It is utilized for the generation of accurate 3D models and composite facade textures from sets of rules which are called Computer Generated Architecture grammars (CGA grammars), defining the objects' detailed geometry, rather than altering or editing the model manually. In this paper, procedural modelling tools have been exploited to generate the 3D model of a traditional settlement in the region of Central Zagori in Greece. The detailed geometries of 3D models derived from the application of shape grammars on selected footprints, and the process resulted in a final 3D model, optimally describing the built environment of Central Zagori, in three levels of Detail (LoD). The final 3D scene was exported and published as 3D web-scene which can be viewed with 3D CityEngine viewer, giving a walkthrough the whole model, same as in virtual reality or game environments. This research work addresses issues regarding textures' precision, LoD for 3D objects and interactive visualization within one 3D scene, as well as the effectiveness of large scale modelling, along with the benefits and drawbacks that derive from procedural modelling techniques in the field of cultural heritage and more specifically on 3D modelling of traditional settlements.

AB  - This paper introduces the EyesWeb XMI platform (for eXtended Multimodal Interaction) as a tool for fast prototyping of multimodal systems, including interconnection of multiple smart devices, e.g., smartphones. EyesWeb is endowed with a visual programming language enabling users to compose modules into applications. Modules are collected in several libraries and include support of many input devices (e.g., video, audio, motion capture, accelerometers, and physiological sensors), output devices (e.g., video, audio, 2D and 3D graphics), and synchronized multimodal data processing. Specific libraries are devoted to real-time analysis of nonverbal expressive motor and social behavior. The EyesWeb platform encompasses further tools such EyesWeb Mobile supporting the development of customized Graphical User Interfaces for specific classes of users. The paper will review the EyesWeb platform and its components, starting from its historical origins, and with a particular focus on the Human-Computer Interaction aspects.

AB  - The past years has seen the emergence and fast growing of various wearable devices, such as smart watches, wrist bands, rings, glasses, jewelry, garments, etc. Although wearable devices have a wide usage scope, healthcare is one of the most promising field which is being exploited by a number of big enterprises and research institutes. However, existing healthcare related wearable products usually work individually. There is almost no data transmission or information exchange between different kinds of devices, which prevents data fusion of multiple devices and development of upper layer healthcare applications. In this demo, we present WearableHUB, a mobile phone based open pervasive wearable data fusion platform for personal health management. WearableHUB can transform multimodal data (motion data, physiological indices, etc.) into unified format according to predefined standard. Other than traditional wearable computing system, WearableHUB not only can get preloaded function results from different devices based on module library according to data type and device position, but also can trigger and get dynamic online downloaded APP function base on fusing multimodal data and extracting higher level information. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Contemporary methods of preserving cultural heritage rely highly on digitization and archiving as foundations for developing various virtual heritage applications. During last two decades, video games proved to be an interactive visual media able to incorporate virtual heritage in amazing and highly appealing ways. At the same time, each video game represents a valuable artifact reflecting technological, socioeconomic and historical issues of its creation. Therefore, video games are an essential and integrated part of modern cultural heritage and themselves need preservation efforts. The present paper discusses video games as a modern tool for presenting cultural heritage by integrating art, storytelling and digital technology. It focuses on both entertainment games and serious games for cultural heritage and provides some illustrative examples of such games with discussing their approach and novelty. On the other hand, video games are viewed as interactive artifacts that are a valuable part of the modern cultural heritage, which requires specific efforts for their preservation together with technological platforms and gaming environment. © 2017 Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Mathematics and Informatics.

AB  - Despite significant advances in technology, the way how research is done and especially communicated has not changed much. We have the vision that ultimately researchers will work on a common knowledge base comprising comprehensive descriptions of their research, thus making research contributions transparent and comparable. The current approach for structuring, systematizing and comparing research results is via survey or review articles. In this article, we describe how surveys for research fields can be represented in a semantic way, resulting in a knowledge graph that describes the individual research problems, approaches, implementations and evaluations in a structured and comparable way. We present a comprehensive ontology for capturing the content of survey articles. We discuss possible applications and present an evaluation of our approach with the retrospective, exemplary semantification of a survey. We demonstrate the utility of the resulting knowledge graph by using it to answer queries about the different research contributions covered by the survey and evaluate how well the query answers serve readers’ information needs, in comparison to having them extract the same information from reading a survey paper. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - As more and more cultural institutions publish their data using the web-of-data semantic level, there is a need for novel applications for exploring, analyzing, mining and visualizing such data. A first step for these applications is to be able to query the linked open data. In this paper we survey the different existing systems for this purpose, providing examples from our experiences in the Cultural Heritage domain, and discussing some possible mutual enrichment between some of them. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - Europeana is an international trusted digital initiative providing access, from a single entry point, to prized collections from a number of European cultural institutions. Advanced Internet and digital technologies present new ways to connect with users; and there is a need continued evaluation of digital libraries. This paper reports on a task oriented, usability study exploring a number of aspects including user satisfaction specific to the Europeana Digital Library. Participants were students from Library Science and Information Systems department, who had some basic experience searching digital collections for information. Participants performed 13 tasks, and focused on the Hellenistic collection. Methodologically, the test was consisted of a list of tasks that among others aimed to assess user satisfaction and interest while performing them. The method applied was measuring Effectiveness, Efficiency, Learnability and Satisfaction. Despite the fact that it was not the first time that they came in contact with a digital library, several participants had difficulties while performing selected tasks, especially when they involved a variety of search types. In general, all of the participants seemed to comprehend how Europeana is organized, although the results also indicate that participants had feelings that expectations were not met when performing more complex tasks. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Important questions about the scientific community, e.g., what authors are the experts in a certain field, or are actively engaged in international collaborations, can be answered using publicly available datasets. However, data required to answer such questions is often scattered over multiple isolated datasets. Recently, the Knowledge Graph (KG) concept has been identified as a means for interweaving heterogeneous datasets and enhancing answer completeness and soundness. We present a pipeline for creating high quality knowledge graphs that comprise data collected from multiple isolated structured datasets. As proof of concept, we illustrate the different steps in the construction of a knowledge graph in the domain of scholarly communication metadata (SCM-KG). Particularly, we demonstrate the benefits of exploiting semantic web technology to reconcile data about authors, papers, and conferences. We conducted an experimental study on an SCM-KG that merges scientific research metadata from the DBLP bibliographic source and the Microsoft Academic Graph. The observed results provide evidence that queries are processed more effectively on top of the SCM-KG than over the isolated datasets, while execution time is not negatively affected. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - This paper reports the outcomes of the conversation moderated by Anna Maria Tammaro, which took place in Bologna during the third AIUCD (Associazione per l'Informatica Umanistica e la Cultura Digitale) conference, between Karen Coyle and Gianmaria Silvello about convergences and divergences of Cultural Heritage (CH) and Computer Science (CS) communities about digital libraries and the Linked Open Data (LOD) paradigm. The conversation has been stimulated in the context of the community of Digital Humanities (DH) scholars, in order to actively engaging them in the linked open data and digital libraries services. The LOD paradigm is a promising technology not only for opening up digital libraries resources, but also for augmenting the discoverability, re-use, enrichment and sharing of their resources on the Web. For the digital libraries LOD can represent a quite significant shift from a "closed paradigm" where the domain expert (e.g the librarian) has the control of the resources to an "open paradigm" where the resources are free to circulate and evolve "without" explicit control of domain experts. In this paper we report some existing positive experiences of integration of the LOD paradigm in the digital library context where the LOD has been used as a publishing paradigm. We also discuss some limitations of the current approach by presenting some open problems that should be investigated to fully realize the LOD paradigm potentialities. © 2014 ACM.

AB  - This article documents the planning, creation, and user testing of a situated mobile story using the ARIS platform. The game, "Getting a Job at Nikki's Place," focuses on a neighborhood restaurant in Orlando, Florida and the life of its current owner, Nick Aiken. Our team used the historical and community aspects of soul food to connect Aiken's story to the broader story of urban revitalization in the Parramore neighborhood. This article illustrates the knowledge our team gained from the experience of mobile storytelling and articulates it into a call for educators to create digital stories with their own students.1.

AB  - Digitization of cultural heritage artefacts is now common. Creation of 3D models by various techniques is widespread. However, most spatial (3D) objects are still represented by photographs in portals such as Europeana. There is a significant potential of using 3D models for education, research, scientific collaboration and popularization. We describe a web-based application that allows scalable visualizations of 3D models ranging from mobile devices to large LCD walls in classrooms and laboratories. Synchronized simultaneous access over a network enables distance learning and collaboration using such models. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.

AB  - The Digital Public Library of America enables the discovery of digitized content held by the U.S. cultural heritage institutions by aggregating metadata contributed from participating organizations. Significant interoperability issues exist when gathering metadata at a national scale, which the Digital Public Library of America mitigates through use of its metadata application profile. In its latest release, the metadata application profile permits the storage of uniform resource identifiers, helping the Digital Public Library of America make the move to linked open data. This article examines these Digital Public Library of America developments through a case study of the Missouri Hub, which facilitates the aggregation of metadata from Missouri-based institutions into the Digital Public Library of America. © 2016, Published with license by Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Art historical photo archives that want to expose their data in Linked Open Data need to rely on shareable models. Merging possibly contradictory information may affect data reliability. In this paper are introduced two ontologies, i.e. F Entry Ontology and OA Entry Ontology, which provide a complete description of items related to Photography and Arts domains and address the description of questionable information provided by different institutions. A preliminary analysis of the Zeri’s photo archive was performed for guiding the creation of the ontologies and the mapping of all the partners’ metadata schemas. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Increasingly sophisticated immersive, interactive visualization technologies are now coupled to rapid expansions in ultra-high-resolution cultural heritage datasets. This chapter situates an understanding of "embodiment" at the forefront of creating meaningful museum experiences using these tools and digital assets. The research presented in this chapter is foregrounded and contextualized with a wider discussion that amalgamates cultural heritage archives with interactive cinema, augmented reality, and embodied narrative. Following a review of embodiment theory that ranges from the phenomenological to the cognitive, the discussion analyses the embodied experience of two digital cultural heritage installations (Pure Land: Inside the Mogao Grottoes and Pure Land: Augmented Reality Edition 2012) as a way of articulating the complexity of human experience inside immersive interactive visualization environments. While the antecedents of these works may be found in the great exhibition complexes of the nineteenth century, this new exhibition machinery provides fresh opportunities to explore paradigms for interpretation and representation of tangible heritage data that subvert didactic models and encourage integrated multisensory and open-ended exploration. Through a close reading of the embodied experience we open up new ways for describing what constitutes a framework for interpretation based on biological, ecological, phenomenological, social, and cultural bodies. The discussion draws a transdisciplinary framework together from post-processural archaeology, philosophy, architecture, cybernetics, human-computer interface design, new media and its archaeology, and new museology. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this study is to synthesize prior user-centered research to develop and present a generalized framework for evaluating visual, i.e. both image and video digital libraries. The primary objectives include comprehensively examining the current state of visual digital library research to: develop a generalized framework applicable for designing user-centered evaluations of visual digital libraries; identify influential experimental factors warranting assessment evaluation as part of specific contexts; and provide examples of applied methods that have been used in research, demonstrating notable findings. Design/methodology/approach – The framework presented in the present study depicts a set of user-centered methodological considerations and examples, synthesized from a review of prior research that provides significant understanding of users and uses of visual information. Findings – Primary components for digital library evaluation, pertaining to user, interaction, system and domain and topic, and their implications for interactive research are presented. Methods, examples and discussion are presented for each primary evaluation component of the framework. Practical implications – Previously applied evaluations and their significance are described and presented as part of the developed framework, providing the importance of each component for practical application in future research and development of interactive visual digital libraries. Originality/value – Visual digital libraries warrant individual assessment, apart from other types of digital collections, as they offer users more ways to retrieve and interact with collection items. The present study complements prior digital library evaluation research by demonstrating the need for a separate framework due to variations influenced by visual information and reporting on evaluations from different perspectives. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The Semantic Web and linked open data enable the publication of digital collection of archives, libraries and museum in the Web eliminating the intermediation of catalog management systems and poses the question of their integration, namely interoperability. In such context the requirements for preserving the original record’s semantics, which are guaranteed by catalog systems, are reinforced. At the same time these technologies enable new cultural relevant relations to be settled between digital objects of different cultural heritage collections. What technological and methodological developments are needed to exploit the facilities brought these technologies? This paper put back the issues related to interoperability between such digital collections in light of the facilities offered by these technologies. It uses as methodology a state of the art review of theoretical and technical issues, projects, cases, etc., related to interoperability and analyses interoperability solutions based on two parameters, homogeneity/heterogeneity and the preservation of original semantic of the collections to be made interoperable. As results the role of semantic models and research on possible semantic relationships between such collections are highlighted as means to achieve interoperability, as well as, in such a context, of digital curation. © 2016, Escola de Ciencia da Informacao da UFMG.

AB  - Web pages increasingly embed structured data in the form of microdata, microformats and RDFa. Through efforts such as schema.org, such embedded markup have become prevalent, with current studies estimating an adoption by about 26% of all web pages. Similar to the early adoption of Linked Data principles by publishers, libraries and other providers of bibliographic data, such organisations have been among the early adopters, providing an unprecedented source of structured data about scholarly works. Such data, however, is fundamentally different from traditional Linked Data, by being very sparsely linked and consisting of a large amount of coreferences and redundant statements. So far, the scale and nature of embedded scholarly data on the Web has not been investigated. In this work, we provide a study on embedded scholarly data to answer research questions about the depth, syntactic and semantic characteristics and distribution of extracted data, thereby investigating challenges and opportunities for using embedded data as a structured knowledge graph of scholarly information. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.

AB  - Historical documentary heritage has a high potential for supporting citizens' awareness of their culture and identity. However, to exploit this potential, access tools are needed, which integrate data from heterogeneous sources and provide an effective user interaction. Moreover, historical archives can become a useful and attractive cultural resource, if they are exploited in popular contexts, such as education and tourism: Innovative ICT-based applications can employ documents, pictures, etc. to guide students and tourists in the discovery of interesting stories, connecting the present to the past, and providing a larger audience with a live access to original cultural heritage resources. In particular, we claim that this scenario can be enabled by providing ICT tools with a rich semantic layer, based on computational ontologies, in which the notions of event and role play a major role. Such a semantic layer can be further enriched by exploiting resources available in the Linked Open Data cloud. © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - We work on converting the metadata of 13 American art museums and archives into Linked Data, to be able to integrate and query the resulting data. While there are many good sources of artist data, no single source covers all artists. We thus address the challenge of building a comprehensive knowledge graph of artists that we can then use to link the data from each of the individual museums. We present a framework to construct and incrementally extend a knowledge graph, describe and evaluate techniques for efficiently building knowledge graphs through the use of the MinHash/LSH algorithm for generating candidate matches, and conduct an evaluation that demonstrates our approach can efficiently and accurately build a knowledge graph about artists. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - The Web of Data is a rapidly growing collection of datasets from a wide range of domains, many of which have spatial–temporal aspects. Hägerstrand's time geography has proven useful for thinking about and understanding the movements and spatial–temporal constraints of humans. In this paper, we explore time geography as a means of querying and integrating multiple spatial–temporal data sources. We formalize the concept of the space–time prism as an ontology design pattern to use as a framework for understanding and representing constraints and interactions between entities in space and time. We build on a formalization of space–time prisms and apply it in the context of the Web of Data, making it usable across multiple domains and topics. We demonstrate the utility of this approach through two use cases from the domains of environmental monitoring and cultural heritage, showing how space–time prisms enable spatial–temporal and semantic reasoning directly on distributed data sources. © 2015 The Authors

AB  - The emergence of Semantic Web and LOD - Linked Open Data - technologies enable that digital objects representing the holdings of archives, libraries and museums collections be semantically interlinked throughout the Web. What are the different types of cultural relevant relationships that may exists between digital objects of collections in archives, libraries and museums throughout the Web? How discover, organize and formalize these relationships to be used by curators in LOD applications? A methodology to analyze the holdings of archives, libraries and museums is proposed based on onomasiologic perspective. Such methodology is applied to a hypothetical competency question that might be proposed by a digital curator. Results indicated that conceptual models such as FRBR, CIDOC CRM and EDM may provide a rich repertoire of semantic relationships that may be used in LOD applications to interlink collections in heritage institutions. © 2016 International Society for Knowledge Organization.

AB  - This paper presents a multimedia tool suite for, on the one hand, the annotation of metadata that encode the dramatic qualities of cultural heritage items, and, on the other, the visualization of such metadata for drama analysis and didactics. The tool suite relies upon an ontology of drama to devise an annotation schema for the metadata concerning the dramatic qualities. The two major modules of the tool suite are a web-based platform, that allows for the insertion of the annotation metadata, and a visualization program for the interactive exploration of such metadata, respectively. The tool suite was tested on the cross-media studies of drama analysis and teaching of drama structure through the application to classical examples. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

AB  - Nowadays, there are rapid developments in the fields of photogrammetry, laser scanning, computer vision and robotics, together aiming to provide highly accurate 3D data that is useful for various applications. In recent years, various LiDAR and image-based techniques have been investigated for 3D modelling because of their opportunities for fast and accurate model generation. For cultural heritage preservation and the representation of objects that are important for tourism and their interactive visualization, 3D models are highly effective and intuitive for present-day users who have stringent requirements and high expectations. Depending on the complexity of the objects for the specific case, various technological methods can be applied. The selected objects in this particular research are located in Bulgaria - A country with thousands of years of history and cultural heritage dating back to ancient civilizations. \this motivates the preservation, visualisation and recreation of undoubtedly valuable historical and architectural objects and places, which has always been a serious challenge for specialists in the field of cultural heritage. In the present research, comparative analyses regarding principles and technological processes needed for 3D modelling and visualization are presented. The recent problems, efforts and developments in interactive representation of precious objects and places in Bulgaria are presented. Three technologies based on real projects are described: (1) image-based modelling using a non-metric hand-held camera; (2) 3D visualization based on spherical panoramic images; (3) and 3D geometric and photorealistic modelling based on architectural CAD drawings. Their suitability for web-based visualization are demonstrated and compared. Moreover the possibilities for integration with additional information such as interactive maps, satellite imagery, sound, video and specific information for the objects are described. This comparative study discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these three approaches and their integration in multiple domains, such as web-based 3D city modelling, tourism and architectural 3D visualization. It was concluded that image-based modelling and panoramic visualisation are simple, fast and effective techniques suitable for simultaneous virtual representation of many objects. However, additional measurements or CAD information will be beneficial for obtaining higher accuracy.

AB  - The modeling of performing arts metadata is considered one of the most challenging problems, since performances add complexities related to events to the classical cultural heritage descriptors associated to physical objects. The most relevant lacks of the present models are related to the modeling of information connected to performers and performances, which are obviously distinguishing aspects of the performing arts and are essential for the preservation of our cultural heritage and literature, such aspects being strongly connected with performing arts. This paper presents the European Collected Library of Artistic Performance (ECLAP) semantic model that has been specifically defined for aggregating and enriching performing arts content coming from several content providers. ECLAP has been set up by the European Commission to play the role of content aggregator for Europeana. The proposed ECLAP semantic model addresses most of the identified problems. The proposed model has been compared with present standards and it is now supported by a graphic tool for user navigation among semantic relationships and Linked Open Data (LOD). The paper also describes the generation of LOD from the ECLAP semantic model and the mapping of ECLAP model to Europeana Data Model (EDM). The experience highlighted that some relevant elements produced, enriched and aggregated by ECLAP cannot be mapped into EDM, while the ECLAP model can address some of the details related to the performing arts which are not at present addressed by the available standards. © 2014, The Author(s).

AB  - A new neutron radiography / tomography / imaging instrument DINGO was built to support the area of neutron imaging research (neutron radiography/tomography) at ANSTO. The instrument is designed for an international user community and for routine quality control for defense, industrial, cultural heritage and archaeology applications. In the industrial field it provides a useful tool for studying cracking and defects in steel or other metals. The instrument construction was completed at the end of June 2013 and it is currently in the hot commissioning stage. The usable neutron flux is mainly determined by the neutron source, but it depends on the instrument position and the resolution. The instrument position for DINGO is the thermal neutron beam port HB-2 in the reactor hall. The measured flux (using gold foil) for an L/D of approximately 500 at HB-2 is 5.3∗107 [n/cm2s], which is in a similar range to other facilities. A special feature of DINGO is the in-pile collimator position in front of the main shutter at HB-2. The collimator offers two pinholes with a possible L/D of 500 and 1000. A secondary collimator separates the two beams by blocking one and positions another aperture for the other beam. The whole instrument operates in two different positions, one for high resolution and one for high speed. In the current configuration DINGO measured first radiography and tomography data sets on friendly user test samples. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Faceted search is a well known and broadly implemented paradigm for filtering information with various types of structured information. In this paper we introduce a multiple-view faceted interface, consisting of one main visualisation for exploring the data and multiple miniaturised visualisations showing the filters. The Recommendation Dashboard tool provides several interactive visualisations for analysing recommender results along various faceted dimensions specific to cultural heritage and scientific content. As our aim is to reduce the user load and optimise the use of screen area, we permit only one main visualisation to be visible at a time, and introduce the concept of micro-visualisations - small, simplified views conveying only the necessary information - to provide natural, easy to understand representation of the the active filter set. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Digital 3D models and their visualizations are increasingly being used in many fields of research, engineering design and humanities. They enable people to see objects in perspectives not available in 2D images. It would be useful if a group of people in a classroom, laboratory or across distances can collaboratively discuss their observations drawn using 3D models. We describe a simple system that allows a group of people to share in real-time their views of a 3D model using their devices ranging from mobile phones to large video walls. We evaluated the system performance and usability with 3D models of digitized cultural heritage objects. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - This paper propose a method for automatically linking spatial information that embedded in cultural heritage metadata to geo linked open data. The spatial information that embedded in a cultural heritage object could be used to enrich information of the other objects. For example, by knowing the spatial relation between two or more CH objects, we could conclude the condition of civilization in the past. Since most of the spatial information might had been documented incompletely, it needs to utilize open geo datasets as a dictionary to identify any place names and its other related information that would be beneficial to enrich CH metadata. However, linking spatial information to geo linked open data could be very troublesome if it done manually. For the experimental purposes, we built a prototype to test the feasibility of our method. As the result, our method are considered could give contribution in generating CH metadata along with their enriched spatial information. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - The internet has come to occupy a central role in the way that we produce, consume and transform knowledge. Search engines have been an important part of the process. This chapter looks at the way that the Web, the Internet, and the connected and networked world create a new, different and interesting model for knowledge. I’m going to discuss how Google works, what it does. In the early days of the web, only rudimentary search engines were available, with partial coverage. Likewise, digitized material remains hard to index; there are many choices to be made. Taking digital objects with heterogeneous taxonomies and mapping them across multiple institutions might allow material as diverse as painting, photography and archives to come together in useful ways. © Fondazione Giorgio Cini onlus 2017.

AB  - COLUMN EDITOR'S NOTES : The “Digital Heritage: Spotlight on Europe” column examines technological advances internal and external to cultural institutions. The digital shift changed radically how cultural heritage is made, disseminated, distributed, accessed, consumed, and monetized. One of the most important revolutions is that the user's role changed dramatically, shifting from passive observers to active participants and content producers with many new and exciting opportunities for engagement, creative use, and access. The strength of the column is its broad, international focus, and contributors are encouraged to explore issues and recent advances in digital heritage theories, methodologies, standards relevant to the European region, as well as the larger, global audience. Interested authors are invited to submit proposals and articles to the column editor at annamaria.tammaro@unipr.it.

AB  - This paper describes the research and design of three tangible and embodied prototypes that aim to enable users to meaningfully engage with an artifact's historical context and use. Together, these prototypes engage users in a cultural heritage experience that is sensorially embodied through a 'multimodal' ensemble of visual, aural, tactile, and olfactory interactions. A preliminary user test suggests that future work on multisensory interaction should focus on developing accessible design principles and considerations that support a sensorially embodied and tangible understanding of historical artifacts. We suggest that multisensory interactions present significant opportunities for interactive exhibits to expand our access to cultural history and its artifacts. © 2016 ACM.

AB  - This book addresses the topic of exploiting enterprise-linked data with a particular focus on knowledge construction and accessibility within enterprises. It identifies the gaps between the requirements of enterprise knowledge consumption and "standard" data consuming technologies by analysing real-world use cases, and proposes the enterprise knowledge graph to fill such gaps. It provides concrete guidelines for effectively deploying linked-data graphs within and across business organizations. It is divided into three parts, focusing on the key technologies for constructing, understanding and employing knowledge graphs. Part 1 introduces basic background information and technologies, and presents a simple architecture to elucidate the main phases and tasks required during the lifecycle of knowledge graphs. Part 2 focuses on technical aspects; it starts with state-of-the art knowledge-graph construction approaches, and then discusses exploration and exploitation techniques as well as advanced question-answering topics concerning knowledge graphs. Lastly, Part 3 demonstrates examples of successful knowledge graph applications in the media industry, healthcare and cultural heritage, and offers conclusions and future visions. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.

AB  - Collaborative e-learning is based on a model where knowledge is created through interaction between members that interact by sharing experiences and knowledge. Linked Open Data (LOD) allow to link data with other related data in which people are interested. As a practical approach we introduce a system where is built cultural heritage knowledge from collaboration between open data published by a regional government, enriched with data from other sources of open linked data cloud like DBPedia. Mobile technologies in e-learning allow learning in any place and moment. We try to take advantage of mobile and semantic technologies, like LOD, in a collaborative e-learning environment. Knowledge is built by enriching open data that are shared by institutions to knowledge shared on Semantic Web, by using LOD techniques, leading a scenario of collaborative and human learning by linking data sources and people who share these data. The collaboration between web of data and open data from a public institution has resulted in practice, in a mobile tourism application that works as a tourist guide for citizens. Application also allows the collaboration of tour guides to add new knowledge about the cultural heritage resources. In brief, collaboration between different profiles generates knowledge and collaborative learning. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - ModRef is a project from the laboratory Labex "Les passés dans le présent", which coordinates various projects on digital humanities. ModRef focuses more precisely on the semantic web and linked open data. The goal is to move heterogeneous data into triplestores also called data warehouses or collections of RDF files in order to improve the sharing, exchange and discovery of new knowledge. For this purpose, the CIDOC-CRM norm has been chosen since it is, at present, the reference for the semantic description of museographic or cultural heritage data. In order to realise the proof of concept of ModRef, a general architecture has been defined, a semantic modelling and data mapping of selected sub-projects of ModRef have been proposed, triplestores have also been created. A web application has been implemented and deployed. This web application describes the ModRef project, as well as it enables visualising, querying and exploring created triplestores. © 2017 INFORSID. All rights reserved.

AB  - Micro-augmentations provide novel ways to interact directly with the past. This is a new concept that uses minimum stimulation to achieve maximum effects in spaces of cultural heritage. We experiment with new implicitly interactive and almost transparent museum technologies to create a holistic emotional visitor experience and solve a number of museum problems (i.e. misconceptions, intra-group communications, and visitor engagement). The paper presents the rationale for the design decisions, as well as the technical challenges faced during implementation. Audio micro-augmentations were firstly used at the UCL Grant Museum of Zoology. Initial user testing data from the system's calibration phase at that museum revealed the entertaining and learning potential of the application, together with issues for future development. © 2015 ACM.

AB  - The documentation of the archaeological heritage through 3D models to know ancient findings, has become a common practice within the international panorama. Using minimal hardware, as well as its ease of use in almost every environmental condition, make 3D sampling solutions based on Multiple View Stereo (MVS) matching and Structure from Motion techniques ideal for on-site documentation of excavations or emergencies. Moreover, the availability of inexpensive platforms for web-based visualization represents great benefit in the field of archaeology, where generally the low budged and the limitation of more complex instruments are a must. The case study presented in these pages, experienced in Petra, Jordan, moves towards this direction. In the close proximity of the El-Khasneh façade, is situated an excavation where two entrance, well preserved, give access to the Tomb of Pharaoh. The documentation described in these pages has the twofold objective of providing the research community with a priceless dataset, acquired for one of the most important heritage of the world that is partially still unknown and to share on line these computations. This work confirms how cultural heritage documentation and dissemination of architectural rests, that are important for tourism and their interactive visualization, can strongly benefit from the creation of 3D models and their sharing on the web. This particular archaeological setting is an interesting base for investigation, given the complexity of the structure and its precarious condition.

AB  - In this paper, we first overview the French project on heritage called PATRIMA, launched in 2011 as one of the Projets d'investissement pour l'avenir, a French funding program meant to last for the next ten years. The overall purpose of the PATRIMA project is to promote and fund research on various aspects of heritage presentation and preservation. Such research being interdisciplinary, research groups in history, physics, chemistry, biology and computer science are involved in this project. The PATRIMA consortium in-volves research groups from universities and from the main museums or cultur-al heritage institutions in Paris and surroundings. More specifically, the main members of the consortium are the two universities of Cergy-Pontoise and Ver-sailles Saint-Quentin and the following famous museums or cultural institu-tions: Musée du Louvre, Château de Versailles, Bibliothèque nationale de France, Musée du Quai Branly, Musée Rodin. In the second part of the paper, we focus on two projects funded by PATRIMA named EDOP and Parcours and dealing with data integration. The goal of the EDOP project is to provide users with a data space for the integration of hetero-geneous information about heritage; Linked Open Data are considered for an ef-fective access to the corresponding data sources. On the other hand, the Par-cours project aims at building an ontology on the terminology about the tech-niques dealing with restoration and/or conservation. Such an ontology is meant to provide a common terminology to researchers using different databases and different vocabularies. © 2017 Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Mathematics and Informatics.

AB  - Cultural Heritage Information (CHI) is scattered among memory institutions, and connecting them together is an important issue for their continued discovery, access, and use. This study proposes a generalized model named Cultural Heritage in Digital Environments (CHDE), which enables the organizing of both tangible and intangible cultural heritage in heterogeneous information environments. The model collects all related digital resources into one instance, which can be later digested into a single digital archive on the networked environment, based on the One-to-One Principle of Metadata. We specially focus on organizing intangible cultural heritage through their instantiations. The proposed model is mapped to renowned cultural heritage models to identify the component entities and to clarify their strengths and the weaknesses. We use South and Southeast Asian cultural heritage information to evaluate the suitability of this model, which is a novel approach in the region. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - In this paper we present a methodology to provide visitors, in smart regions, additional cultural heritage attractions based on prior museum visits using user models and Linked Open Data. Visitor preferences and behavior are tracked via a museum mobile guide and used to create a visitor model. Semantic models and Linked Open Data support the representation of regional assets as Cultural Objects. The visitor model preferences are exploited using a graph similarity approach in order to identify personalized opportunities for visitors by filtering relevant Cultural Objects. © 2015 CEUR-WS.

AB  - Millions of specimens housed in collections of natural history institutions document our planet’s biodiversity over centuries and represent both an indispensable knowledge base for today’s biological research as well as a cultural heritage. Digitization efforts of the past years have produced a substantial amount of digital assets: high-resolution images, videos, sound files, 3D imagery and 3D models. The OpenUp! Natural History Aggregator draws together these virtual representations of specimens from a multitude of institutions and feeds them into Europeana, the cross-domain portal for Europe’s digitized cultural heritage. Enriching their metadata with data drawn from additional resources such as common names, taxonomic literature and geographic terms helps to increase discoverability und usability. The assignment of stable uniform resource locators and the application of standard vocabularies, existing ontologies and frameworks like RDF allow effective linking of web resources from different knowledge domains, thus creating linked open data. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.

AB  - This paper describes the full procedure adopted in the context of the Clavius on the Web project, which aims to help Web users to appraise the importance of specific manuscripts by going beyond their digital reproduction. The proposed approach is based on the multilayered explication of linguistic, lexical and semantic data representing the innermost nature of the analyzed manuscripts. The final purpose of the project is to gather and display the results of the three layers of analysis through interactive visualization techniques and export them as Linked Data. All the analyses rely on the XML/TEI encoding of the text, followed by a CTS-based tokenization. As a working example for this paper, the analysis of a portion of a manuscript provided by Historical Archives of the Pontifical Gregorian University will be illustrated. The text is a letter written in Latin and sent by Botvitus Nericius to Christophorus Clavius in 1598 from Madrid. © 2014 ACM.

AB  - Recently Web search engines have built knowledge graphs to support entity search and to provide structural summaries calledemph{knowledge cards} for entities mentioned in queries. Different knowledge cards might be complementary or even have conflicts on values of the equivalent property. Thus, it is essential to achieve a more comprehensive fused card from those individual cards representing the same entity. In this paper, we present a system with technical details of card disambiguation, property alignment, value deduplication and card ranking to fuse knowledge cards from various search engines. We further develop a Javascript library called KCF.js based on the card fusion engine and demonstrates its usability via three possible applications. © 2016 owner/author(s).

AB  - Berkeley FrameNet is a lexico-semantic resource for English based on the theory of frame semantics. It has been exploited in a range of natural language processing applications and has inspired the development of framenets for many languages. We present a methodological approach to the extraction and generation of a computational multilingual FrameNet-based grammar and lexicon. The approach leverages FrameNet-annotated corpora to automatically extract a set of cross-lingual semantico-syntactic valence patterns. Based on data from Berkeley FrameNet and Swedish FrameNet, the proposed approach has been implemented in Grammatical Framework (GF), a categorial grammar formalism specialized for multilingual grammars. The implementation of the grammar and lexicon is supported by the design of FrameNet, providing a frame semantic abstraction layer, an interlingual semantic application programming interface (API), over the interlingual syntactic API already provided by GF Resource Grammar Library. The evaluation of the acquired grammar and lexicon shows the feasibility of the approach. Additionally, we illustrate how the FrameNet-based grammar and lexicon are exploited in two distinct multilingual controlled natural language applications. The produced resources are available under an open source license. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Smart Data is a central element for the Publishing Industry. A review of the rich data published by Elsevier via 9 Research platforms will be presented. Particular emphasis will be devoted to our investments in Knowledge graphs, Information Extraction, and Entity annotation. After this initial introduction, we will focus our attention on three particular applications built on top of our rich data. Authors’ disambiguation is an open research problem where the goal is to match different identities attributed to the same Author during his/her life. Article fingerprinting is a rich set of information extraction techniques used for classifying articles and for building analytical tools leveraged by research institutions. News Trend detection is another rich set of matching tools used for tracking how institutions and researchers are mentioned by public and social media. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - An integrated nondestructive assay (NDA) system combining active (neutron generator) and passive neutron detection and passive gamma (PG) detection is being analyzed in order to estimate the amount of plutonium, verify initial enrichment, burnup, and cooling time, and detect partial defects in a spent fuel assembly (SFA). Active signals are measured using the differential die-away (DDA), delayed neutron (DN), and delayed gamma (DG) techniques. Passive signals are measured using total neutron (TN) counts and both gross and spectral resolved gamma counts. To quantify how a system of several NDA techniques is expected to perform, all of the relevant NDA techniques listed above were simulated as a function of various reactor conditions such as initial enrichment, burnup, cooling time, assembly shuffling pattern, reactor operating conditions (including temperature, pressure, and the presence of burnable poisons) by simulating the NDA response for five sets of light water reactor assemblies. This paper compares the performance of several exploratory model-fitting options (including neural networks, adaptive regression with splines, iterative bias reduction smoothing, projection pursuit regression, and regression with quadratic terms and interaction terms) to relate data simulated with measurement and model error effects from various subsets of the NDA techniques to the total Pu mass. Isotope masses for SFAs and expected detector responses (DRs) for several NDA techniques are simulated using MCNP, and the DRs become inputs to the fitting process. Such responses include eight signals from DDA, one from DN, one from TN, and up to seven from PG; the DG signal will be examined separately. Results are summarized using the root-mean-squared estimation error for plutonium mass in held-out subsets of the data for a range of model and measurement error variances. Different simulation assumptions lead to different spent fuel libraries relating DRs to Pu mass. Some results for training with one library and testing with another library are also given.

AB  - This paper focuses on the semantic annotation of textual content and on annotation requirements that emerge from the needs of cultural heritage annotation projects. The requirements presented here are based on two text annotation case studies at the National Library of Latvia and were generalised to be applicable to a wider range of annotation projects. This paper describes the requirements collected and how they may be implemented in practical applications. We propose a model for representing annotation data and implementing annotation systems. In particular, the model introduces a separate entity database that maintains information about the entities referenced from annotations and can point to additional information about these entities such as Linked Open Data resources. The result of this work is the annotation model and a collection of requirements that can be applied in different configurations depending on particular use cases and can provide a basis for developing and improving annotation tools.

AB  - The 200,000 records in the catalogue of the Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes have been migrated to a new relational database whose data model adheres to the FRBR and FRAD specifications. The database content has been later mapped to RDF triples which employ the RDA vocabulary to describe the entities, as well as their properties and relationships. The intermediate relational model —ensuring, for example, referential integrity—provides tighter control over the process and, therefore, enhanced validation of the output. This RDF-based semantic description of the catalogue is now accessible online and supports browsing and searching the information. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Based on cultural heritage plays about throwing action, we made a public interactive artwork by throwing pseudo-balls, “deBallution.” Audience members participated in interactive artwork not only for pleasure but also as part of their cultural heritage, maintaining and also disrupting social orders and structures. First of all, this research extracted the audience’s basic activities from cultural archetypes. Then, it applied audience activities to a basic model of public interactive artwork for playing on a media façade to participating in collective performance for disruptive social structures. The interactive artwork concept is to catch audience members’ throwing movements on a virtual screen and drawing various generated kaleidoscope images to predict points from the audience throwing on the screen. We made prototype “deBallution” and then exhibited it and evaluated user tests. Through evaluation results for the prototype, we revised “deBallution” artwork contents for developing artistic values and produced overall interactive artwork. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Pundit 2.0 is a semantic web annotation system that supports users in creating structured data on top of web pages. Annotations in Pundit are RDF triples that users build starting from web page elements, as text or images. Annotations can be made public and developers can access and combine them into RDF knowledge graphs, while authorship of each triple is always retrievable. In this demo we showcase Pundit 2.0 and demonstrate how it can be used to enhance a digital library, by providing a data crowdsourcing platform. Pundit enables users to annotate different kind of entities and to contribute to the collaborative creation of a knowledge graph. This, in turn, refines in real-time the exploration functionalities of the library’s faceted search, providing an immediate added value out of the annotation effort. Ad-hoc configurations can be used to drive specific visualisations, like the timeline-map shown in this demo. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - In silico drug discovery refers to a combination of computational techniques that augment our ability to discover drug compounds from compound libraries. Many such techniques exist, including virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS), high-throughput screening (HTS), and mechanisms for data storage and querying. However, presently these tools are often used independent of one another. In this chapter, we describe a new multimodal in silico technique for the hit identification and lead generation phases of traditional drug discovery. Our technique leverages the benefits of three independent methods—virtual high-throughput screening, high-throughput screening, and structural fingerprint analysis—by using a fourth technique called topological data analysis (TDA). We describe how a compound library can be independently tested with vHTS, HTS, and fingerprint analysis, and how the results can be transformed into a topological data analysis network to identify compounds from a diverse group of structural families. This process of using TDA or similar clustering methods to identify drug leads is advantageous because it provides a mechanism for choosing structurally diverse compounds while maintaining the unique advantages of already established techniques such as vHTS and HTS. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce the i-Treasures Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) dataset, a freely available collection of multimodal data captured from different forms of rare ICH. More specifically, the dataset contains video, audio, depth, motion capture data and other modalities, such as EEG or ultrasound data. It also includes (manual) annotations of data, while in some cases additional features and metadata are provided, extracted using algorithms and modules developed within the i-Treasures project. We describe the creation process (sensors, capture setups and modules used), the dataset content and the associated annotations. An attractive feature of this ICH Database is that it's the first of its kind, providing annotated multimodal data for a wide range of rare ICH types. Finally, some conclusions are drawn and the future development of the dataset is discussed. © 2016 ACM.

AB  - In this paper we describe the pilot project dati.culturaitalia.it, which started in 2012 to build up a Linked Open Data (LOD) Service that will progressively make available open datasets from the web-portal CulturaItalia 1, the Italian national aggregator for Europeana 2. CIDOC-CRM Ontology was used for transformation and representation of data widely pertaining to the cultural domain. RDF triples mapped into Erlangen CRM were then enriched with links to URIs identifying instances of internationally established RDF resources for geographic names, and instances of authority files for personal and corporate names, such as GeoNames and Virtual International Authority File (VIAF). CulturaItalia is the Portal of Italian Culture, promoted by the Italian Ministry of cultural heritage, activities and tourism (MiBACT), in which cultural institutions from all sectors and levels (national, regional and local) are involved. CulturaItalia also plays an important role for the development of Europeana, making available cooperative networks and agreements and coordinating technical activities leading to the establishment of Europeana environment. © 2015, CEUR-WS.

AB  - Linked data presents numerous implementation challenges in cultural heritage institutions. The Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) has emerged as a resource for cultural heritage institutions to contribute metadata records for their digital assets to a national aggregation platform, one that is actively being developed to express contributed metadata as linked data. At present, there is a dearth of literature on the DPLA, and especially on its hubs. This poster aims to fill that gap by documenting the formation of the Missouri Hub, the DPLA Service Hub for Missouri, as a model for institutions with similar collective goals of exposing and enriching their data through the DPLA. Using Rogers's () Diffusion of innovations theory, we apply a post-implementation descriptive application of Rogers's model for the innovation process in an organization to the formation of the Missouri Hub. The five steps to implementation are presented, including the initiation and decision process. This poster presents and analyzes one approach to adopting and implementing the DPLA, an innovation supporting cultural heritage institutions and their goals of exposing and enriching their data. By working collaboratively, the institutions were able to achieve a goal that they could not attain individually. Copyright © 2015 by Association for Information Science and Technology

AB  - This article traces ideological constructions of communication that enable powerful actors to determine what counts as silences, lies and surpluses in efficacious narratives about violence (Briggs 2007) in order to elucidate occlusions regarding legacies of the Civil War in the Irish Free State. It does so through a precise triangulation of multiple competing and overlapping narratives from unpublished fieldnotes, interviews, published ethnographies and other first-person accounts. The inquiry highlights social memories of the Irish Civil War that have been 'assumed, distorted, misunderstood, manipulated, underestimated, but most of all, ignored' (Dolan 2003: 2). The article argues that the excesses of the anthropological archive make the recuperation of a multiplicity of collective memories possible through a linguistic anthropological perspective that enumerates the kind of erasures at play in contentious memory-making moments, highlights polyvocality in metapragmatic discourse and tracks the gaps in entextualisation processes of historical narratives about political turmoil. © Berghahn Journals.

AB  - In the cultural heritage domain, there is a huge interest in utilizing semantic web technology and build services enabling users to query, explore and access the vast body of cultural heritage information that has been created over decades by memory institutions. For successful conversion of existing data into semantic web data, however, there is often a need to enhance and enrich the legacy data to validate and align it with other resources and reveal its full potential. In this visionary paper, we describe a framework for semantic enrichment that relies on the creation of thematic knowledge bases, i.e., about a given topic. These knowledge bases aggregate information by exploiting structured resources (e.g., Linked Open Data cloud) and by extracting new relationships from streams (e.g., Twitter) and textual documents (e.g., web pages). Our focused application in this paper is how this approach can be utilized when transforming library records into semantic web data based on the FRBR model in the process that commonly is called FRBRization. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - The relevance of Named-Entity Recognition and Entity Linking for cultural heritage institutions is evaluated through a casestudy involving the semantic enrichment of historical periodicals. A language-independent approach is proposed in order to improve the search experience of end-users with the mapping of entities to the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud. Preliminary results show that a precision rate of almost 90% can be achieved with very little fine-tuning, while an increase in recall remains necessary. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - The “K-Culture Time Machine” project develops technologies to structure diverse cultural content from associated organizations and projects, including the “Cultural Heritage hub-bank,” and construct new cultural content connected to time and space, then develop a technique that provides the structured content to industries (culture, tourism, IT) and the public. To integrate heterogeneous dataset, designing a new data model is a vital process for our project. As Europeana designed data model which aims to integrate and link several data set across cultural institutions of Europe, we also invented a new data model that encompasses a wide range of metadata for cultural institution in Korea. This approach and data model aim to provide a possibility of semantic link between heterogeneous dataset. This project also provides services with various visualization techniques (virtual reality, augmented reality, etc.) for cultural heritage by traveling through a variety of historical periods in its contents. Last, the project develops image-based time-space content configuration techniques and a software framework that enables visualization with various devices. We perform a validation and feedback process of research and development on the implemented prototype service “Journey of a Korean world cultural heritage”. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Communities addressing the problem of a shareable description of cultural heritage objects agree that a data-centric and context oriented approach should be reached in order to exchange and reuse heterogenous information. Here we present HiCO, an OWL 2 DL ontology aiming to outline relevant issues related to the workflow for stating, and formalizing, authoritative assertions about context information. The conceptual model outlines requirements for defining an authoritative statement and focuses on how a description of context information can be carried out when data are extracted from full-text of documents. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - In this paper, we present an application framework, ArsEmotica 2.0, where semantic technologies, linked data and natural language processing techniques are exploited for investigating the emotional aspects of cultural heritage artifacts, based on user generated contents collected in art social platforms. We rely on affective categorization models expressed by an ontology well grounded in psychology and encoded in W3C standard specification languages.We present the implementation and exploitation of the framework on a real dataset, the ArsMeteo online collection, aiming to adapt human access to cultural heritage collections by visualising emotions detected in artworks, and to let computer access by means of Linked Open Data. The use of semantic technologies enables both automatic reasoning on the elicited affective information, and interoperability or integration of tools developed within the Semantic Web and Linked Data Community.
