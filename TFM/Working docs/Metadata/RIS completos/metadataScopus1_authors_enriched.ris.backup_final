AB  - Parenting brings emotional and physical challenges, from balancing work, childcare, and finances to coping with exhaustion and limited personal time. Yet, one in three parents never seek support. AI systems potentially offer stigma-free, accessible, and affordable solutions. Yet, user adoption often fails due to issues with explainability and reliability. To see if these issues could be solved using a co-design approach, we developed and tested NurtureBot, a wellbeing support assistant for new parents. 32 parents co-designed the system through Asynchronous Remote Communities method, identifying the key challenge as achieving a "successful chat."As part of co-design, parents role-played as NurtureBot, rewriting its dialogues to improve user understanding, control, and outcomes. The refined prototype, featuring an Interaction Layer, was evaluated by 32 initial and 46 new parents, showing improved user experience and usability, with final CUQ score of 91.3/100, demonstrating successful interaction patterns. Our process revealed useful interaction design lessons for effective AI parenting support. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Pre-medical students face the challenge of managing rigorous academic and extracurricular demands, which can lead to burnout. Effective tracking and visualization of their activities are crucial in keeping records of student progress. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a user-friendly dashboard tailored for pre-medical student data management. Semi-structured interviews with nine medical sciences baccalaureate program (MSBP) faculty members identified major issues in current data management practices, including standardization and tracking. Using affinity diagramming and Miroboard, five key themes emerged, guiding the creation of an initial dashboard prototype. After iterative critiques and revisions, the final design received positive feedback from the MSBP committee. Limitations include a small sample size and a lack of formal usability testing. Future work will focus on addressing implementation challenges and refining the design based on user feedback. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Emerging AR applications require seamless integration of the virtual and physical worlds, which calls for tools that support both passive perception and active manipulation of the environment, enabling bidirectional interaction. We introduce EchoSight, a system for AR glasses that enables efficient look-and-control bidirectional interaction. EchoSight exploits optical wireless communication to instantaneously connect virtual data with its physical counterpart. EchoSight's unique dual-element optical design leverages beam directionality to automatically align the user's focus with target objects, reducing the overhead in both target identification and subsequent communication. This approach streamlines user interaction, reducing cognitive load and enhancing engagement. Our evaluations demonstrate EchoSight's effectiveness for room-scale communication, achieving distances up to 5 m and viewing angles up to 120 degrees. A study with 12 participants confirms EchoSight's improved efficiency and user experience over traditional methods, such as QR Code scanning and voice control, in AR IoT applications. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Purpose: Interdisciplinary PhD programs can be challenging as the vital information needed by students may not be readily available; it is scattered across the university’s websites, while tacit knowledge can be obtained only by interacting with people. Hence, there is a need to develop a knowledge management model to create, query and maintain a knowledge repository for interdisciplinary students. This study aims to propose a knowledge graph containing information on critical categories (faculty, classes, dissertations, etc.) and their relationships, extracted from multiple sources, essential for interdisciplinary PhD students. This study evaluates the usability of a participatory-designed knowledge graph intended to facilitate information exchange and decision-making. Methodology: The authors used data from multiple sources (such as university websites, faculty profiles, publication and dissertation metadata and crowdsourced data) to generate a knowledge graph in the Neo4J Bloom platform. The authors recruited 15 interdisciplinary PhD students using convenience sampling from the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa at various PhD stages to design and populate the knowledge graph. Next, the authors conducted a mixed methods study to perform its usability evaluation. First, the authors engaged the students in a participatory design workshop to identify relevant graph queries. Second, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews to determine the usability of the knowledge graph and rate the queries. Each interview was coded with structural and thematic codes and was further analyzed using sentiment analysis in R programming language. Findings: The usability findings demonstrate that interaction with this knowledge graph benefits PhD students by notably reducing uncertainty and academic stress, particularly among newcomers. Knowledge graph supported them in decision-making, especially when choosing collaborators (e.g. supervisor or dissertation committee members) in an interdisciplinary setting. Key helpful features are related to exploring student–faculty networks, milestones tracking, rapid access to aggregated data and insights into crowdsourced fellow students’ activities. However, they showed concerns about crowdsourced data privacy and accessibility. Although participants expressed the need for more qualitative data in the graph, they noted it helped identify people to talk to about the topics of their interest. Originality: The knowledge graph provides a solution to meet the personalized needs of doctoral researchers and has the potential to improve the information discovery and decision-making process substantially. It also includes the tacit knowledge exchange support missing from most current approaches, which is critical for this population and establishing interdisciplinary collaborations. This approach can be applied to other interdisciplinary programs and domains globally. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Due to COVID-19 outbreak in Phuket, Thailand, there has been a huge impact on the economics because the Phuket economics relies on tourism. Many are unemployed or halved their salaries. Facebook marketplace is an easy and fast option to start a food and beverage business online, even though there are some drawbacks and limitations. This work studies food and beverage businesses and consumer behaviors using 4P's and 4C's marketing strategy to develop a solution for businesses in Phuket, Thailand. A Prototyping model in software engineering is employed to fabricate an application, namely UMARKET. The results reveal most common problems from the buyers and sellers which are available products in stock, order tracking, slow communication, manual input during the purchase, and delivery routing. UMARKET functionalities are developed to solve those problems and the user satisfactory is evaluated using usability testing method. The average score is 4.35 out of 5 with standard deviation of 0.71. We would conclude that most of the users satisfy UMARKET and it solves the problems encountered by Facebook marketplace users.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Existing virtual reality (VR) street view and 360-degree road view applications often rely on complex controllers or touch interfaces, which can hinder user immersion and accessibility. These challenges are particularly pronounced for under-represented populations, such as older adults and individuals with limited familiarity with digital devices. Such groups frequently face physical or environmental constraints that restrict their ability to engage in outdoor activities, highlighting the need for alternative methods of experiencing the world through virtual environments. To address this issue, we propose a VR street view application featuring an intuitive, gesture-based interface designed to simplify user interaction and enhance accessibility for socially disadvantaged individuals. Our approach seeks to optimize digital accessibility by reducing barriers to entry, increasing user immersion, and facilitating a more inclusive virtual exploration experience. Through usability testing and iterative design, this study evaluates the effectiveness of gesture-based interactions in improving accessibility and engagement. The findings emphasize the importance of user-centered design in fostering an inclusive VR environment that accommodates diverse needs and abilities. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Adults with cancer experience symptoms that change across the disease trajectory. Due to the distress and cost associated with uncontrolled symptoms, improving symptom management is an important component of quality cancer care. Clinical decision support (CDS) is a promising strategy to integrate clinical practice guideline (CPG)-based symptom management recommendations at the point of care. Methods: The objectives of this project were to develop and evaluate the usability of two symptom management algorithms (constipation and fatigue) across the trajectory of cancer care in patients with active disease treated in comprehensive or community cancer care settings to surveillance of cancer survivors in primary care practices. A modified ADAPTE process was used to develop algorithms based on national CPGs. Usability testing involved semi-structured interviews with clinicians from varied care settings, including comprehensive and community cancer centers, and primary care. The transcripts were analyzed with MAXQDA using Braun and Clarke’s thematic analysis method. A cross tabs analysis was also performed to assess the prevalence of themes and subthemes by cancer care setting. Results: A total of 17 clinicians (physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants) were interviewed for usability testing. Three main themes emerged: (1) Algorithms as useful, (2) Symptom management differences, and (3) Different target end-users. The cross-tabs analysis demonstrated differences among care trajectories and settings that originated in the Symptom management differences theme. The sub-themes of “Differences between diseases” and “Differences between care trajectories” originated from participants working in a comprehensive cancer center, which tends to be disease-specific locations for patients on active treatment. Meanwhile, participants from primary care identified the sub-theme of “Differences in settings,” indicating that symptom management strategies are care setting specific. Conclusions: While CDS can help promote evidence-based symptom management, systems providing care recommendations need to be specifically developed to fit patient characteristics and clinical context. Findings suggest that one set of algorithms will not be applicable throughout the entire cancer trajectory. Unique CDS for symptom management will be needed for patients who are cancer survivors being followed in primary care settings. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Virtual Reality (VR) is increasingly applied in education, yet most systems remain inaccessible to visually impaired learners. This study addresses that gap by developing a user-centered VR platform to support library orientation for visually impaired university students. Conducted at a Thai university, the research employed a research and development methodology, combining quantitative and qualitative data collection through usability testing, satisfaction questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews. A digital twin of the university library was created using Unity and deployed on Meta Quest 2, incorporating assistive features such as spatial audio cues, adjustable text, customizable lighting and contrast, and alerts for grade separation. Eight visually impaired students participated in the evaluation. Quantitative results showed a moderate usability score (average SUS = 67.83), while qualitative feedback emphasized the value of adjustable text and audio cues, with suggestions for improved personalization of contrast settings and audio speed. The study demonstrates the feasibility of inclusive VR design and provides practical insights for supporting visually impaired students, offering guidance for educators, developers, and policymakers seeking to advance digital accessibility and equity in higher education. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Visually impaired persons use smartphones daily to perform basic actions such as interacting with others through calling, texting, and using social media applications. They require interactions that ease the use of these applications. This paper presents the design of multimodal gestures for visually impaired smartphone users to support them in performing basic tasks and compares their usability with Android accessibility gestures (unimodal design). The paper presents a set of multimodal interactions combining surface, speech, and motion gestures, modelled using the User-Centred Design approach. The design process involved participatory sessions with ten visually impaired smartphone users. The proposed design is developed to replace surface gestures (the current unimodal design) that provide vocal feedback via Talkback functionality. User testing was conducted to evaluate the designed multimodal gestures and to compare their performance with Android accessibility gestures from the point of view of 12 visually impaired smartphone users. Performance metrics (task completion time and the number of errors) and satisfaction metrics (using the System Usability Scale questionnaire) were collected. The usability testing results showed that visually impaired smartphone users perform tasks 3.5 times faster when using the proposed multimodal interactions than unimodal. An average of 87% of the interaction errors made by the users were reduced using the proposed multimodal design compared with the unimodal interactions. In addition, the results showed that 71% of the participants reported that they like to use the designed multimodal interactions compared to the existing Android accessibility gesture, and 66.7% of the participants found it easier and more confident to use than existing unimodal interactions. Hypothesis testing proves a significant difference between unimodal and the proposed multimodal gestures in task completion time, errors rate and satisfaction rate. The study provides insight for future work extending multimodal interactions into various smartphone functions to ease its use for visually impaired users. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - Fact-checking has emerged as a principal part of news reporting with over 400 fact-checking organisations worldwide. However, fewer than one in ten individuals report having used a fact-checking service. In this paper, we introduce Google Inject: a technology-mediated nudge that integrates, relevant to one's query, fact-checks, into the Google search results page. We report on a laboratory study that inquired into how four design variables, in particular, the number of fact-checking articles injected, their positioning, concealment and seamlessness affect users' experience and proximal behaviours with Google Inject. All in all, the paper highlights the complexity and importance of nudge design, as seemingly subtle variations in the design and implementation of a nudge can have a profound impact on its effectiveness. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - This study introduces the Eye-tracking Translation Software (ETS), a system that leverages eye-tracking data and real-time translation to enhance reading flow for non-native language users in complex, technical texts. By measuring the fixation duration, we can detect moments of cognitive load, ETS selectively provides translations, maintaining reading flow and engagement without undermining language learning. The key technological components include a desktop eye-tracker integrated with a custom Python-based application. Through a user-centered design, ETS dynamically adapts to individual reading needs, reducing cognitive strain by offering word-level translations when needed. A study involving 53 participants assessed ETS’s impact on reading speed, fixation duration, and user experience, with findings indicating improved comprehension and reading efficiency. Results demonstrated that gaze-based adaptations significantly improved their reading experience and reduced cognitive load. Participants positively rated ETS’s usability and were noted through preferences for customization, such as pop-up placement and sentence-level translations. Future work will integrate AI-driven adaptations, allowing the system to adjust based on user proficiency and reading behavior. The study contributes to the growing evidence of eye-tracking’s potential in educational and professional applications, offering a flexible, personalized approach to reading assistance that balances language exposure with real-time support. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: To design, develop, and field test the HPV Decide decision tool to facilitate shared clinical decision-making recommendation for mid-adult HPV vaccination. Methods: The ‘HPV Decide’ online tool was developed through a 6-step process, involving community and provider advisory boards, usability testing with 10 end users (unvaccinated adults aged 27–45), field testing interviews with another 10, and interviews with 18 healthcare providers. The process incorporated both inductive and deductive qualitative data analyses. Results: The logic model, based on the Ottawa Decision Support Framework, highlighted the importance of objective knowledge and managing decisional conflict. Iterative modifications were informed by the advisory boards, alpha testing, and usability testing. Field testing showed utility to end users, highlighting the straightforward design, and lack of medical jargon. Many expressed a desire to access the tool before doctor appointments, emphasizing its value in a healthcare context and in partnership with providers. Lastly, healthcare provider feedback highlighted information quality, structure, acceptability, and future implementation. Discussion: While users recognized the tool's information quality and user-centric design, full evaluation focused on changes in informed decision making and clinic-based implementation are needed. Practical value: The HPV Decide decision tool demonstrates promise in supporting informed decisions about HPV vaccination among mid-adults. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background Blood product ordering is a complex process and mistakes can harm patients and lead to poor outcomes. Orders and order sets can be designed to help mitigate errors, but major changes in design can unintentionally cause new errors. Objectives Our objective was as follows: (1) utilize formative in situ usability testing to iteratively improve the design of a redesigned blood product order set prior to go-live, (2) implement changes based on feedback derived from this testing, and (3) compare the error rate, system usability scale (SUS) score, time to task completion, and click counts between the prior order set in use at the time and the revised redesigned order set. Methods A multidisciplinary project team convened to redesign blood product orders and order sets from scratch based on a review of the literature and benchmarking against four pediatric academic institutions with the goal of addressing prior ordering errors. The newly redesigned blood product order set was iteratively updated via in situ formative usability testing performed with available clinical users using a concurrent think-aloud protocol in real clinical environments. Errors, SUS scores, time to task completion, and click counts were assessed for the revised redesigned order set using summative testing. Results Formative usability testing with 20 participants led to seven design changes in the redesigned order set which reduced the error rate at go-live. Summative usability testing showed that even though the usability scores were only slightly improved for the revised redesigned order set, the error rates in blood orders were significantly decreased. Conclusion Usability testing can identify design errors early in the process which can be rectified prior to implementation, thus avoiding unintended consequences of changes. © 2024. Thieme.

AB  - Background: Blood pressure control is critical for older adults because the prevalence of hypertension and resulting cardiovascular illness increases with age. Antihypertension medications are central to blood pressure treatment. However, nonadherence to antihypertension medications is high. Health technology such as smartphone apps provide an opportunity for users to manage their medication regimen and support processes related to medication-taking. Objective: We implemented a user-centered evaluation approach to develop and refine adherence feedback visualizations for the MEDSReM© medication adherence app for older adults with hypertension. Methods: We conducted a literature review and iterative usability testing to achieve this objective. We identified adherence goals, information needs, as well as design guidelines by reviewing theoretical frameworks and existing scientific evidence. We then used a two-phase iterative user-centered study and subject matter expert evaluation. Both quantitative and qualitative data were used to select and improve the current prototype and evolve to the next prototype. Results: The need for daily, weekly, and monthly adherence performance information as well as visualization formats for conveying this information was identified from the literature review. Overall, the information shown in visualization prototypes was successfully interpreted by participants. Comprehension issues of visualizations were identified and addressed from visual prototype revisions. Insights from both user and subject matter expert groups were used to select and refine the prototypes for the MEDSReM app. Conclusion: Evidence-based and user-centered approaches were effective for developing visualizations about adherence performance feedback in the MEDSReM app and provided insight into how the app can be made easy to understand and use by older adults with hypertension, which will be evaluated in future effectiveness testing. © 2024

AB  - Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSD) result from continuous exposure to risk factors associated with the workplace. They affect millions of workers worldwide, including those in the healthcare sector. One of Ergonomics’ concerns is fitting job demands to workers’ capabilities, namely by providing risk assessment methods as tools to support the implementation of preventive strategies for WRMSD. Currently, advanced wearable technology is being used to gather objective exposure measurements in a work context. Ergo4workers (E4W) is a system that includes a smartphone app to integrate data from wearable sensors. It was developed following the User-Centered Design (UCD) iterative process. This approach was adopted to design a useful and usable app that assesses healthcare professionals during their daily activities, namely by providing feedback on the working postures. This paper describes the design cycle’s second iteration. The second prototype was designed according to user requirements, building on an initial prototype’s findings, and was tested by a potential representative user using the Cognitive Walkthrough method. Test results evidenced adequate usability, and the healthcare professional expressed satisfaction regarding the interaction with the app. Furthermore, the new findings are being used to refine the design solution, to be implemented and evaluated in a third UCD cycle iteration. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Education and skills training have consistently been recognized as an unmet need for caregivers of individuals with psychosis, as traditional models of clinician-delivered family interventions remain inaccessible to most caregivers across low-, middle-, and high-income countries. We endeavored to expand access to psychosis education and skills training by co-developing a digital training platform with experts and families. We engaged in collaborative co-design sessions with caregivers who had received training in Psychosis REACH—an evidence-based psychosocial family intervention for psychosis—to elicit design principles, develop a functional prototype, and engage in usability testing of an online interactive training program. Seven participants reported six design principles for a prototype. These included simplicity, accessibility, skill acquisition, usability, sense of community, and hope. Guided by these principles, participants’ preferred features were (1) online modules with didactic content, (2) a training “coach” conversational agent to provide instruction and feedback to users, and (3) a conversational agent simulation of an individual experiencing psychosis with whom users can practice skills. Participants completed the usability testing. The levels of ease of use ranged from 4.2 to 4.8 on a 5-point scale with 5 being easiest to use and the level of usefulness ranged from 4 to 4.75 on a 5-point scale, with 5 being most useful. This study is the first to develop a digital platform for family caregivers to support interactive skills training for psychosis caregiving at home. Iterative user-centered design resulted in a functional alpha prototype ripe for testing. Future directions include testing the design requirements on more diverse users and evaluating the effects of the online platform on the caregiving experience. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - The complexity of automotive user interfaces impacts cognitive load and situation awareness of drivers. The aim of the present study is to empirically investigate the relationship between the complexity of the infotainment system in manual vehicles and driver situation awareness. In this experiment we compare the differences between a simple and a complex infotainment system, comparing the independent variable of infotainment system complexity at two levels (low and high complexity) within a simulated driving environment. The Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) was utilized to measure situation awareness in a sample of n=6 licensed drivers, this work is an exercise as part of a lecture. Our findings indicate a variation in SAGAT scores between the two complexity conditions, though there is no statistical differences. These findings indicate the necessity of balancing infotainment system complexity with user-centered design principles to enhance driver safety in manual vehicles. The study advocates for more extensive and diverse investigations in future research. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

One common form of allergy is food allergy Food allergies can cause rashes, swelling, digestive difficulties, and even death. In the constantly evolving food sector, food delivery services have appeared to help consumers save time and effort. However, the wide number of restaurants and menus available might be a double-edged sword for customers who are allergic to certain food items. Therefore, this research focuses on addressing the problems faced by users with food allergies on GrabFood, an online food delivery service by Grab, using the user-centered design method. The study resulted in an interaction design that includes features such as an allergy profile, allergen information display, filtered ratings and reviews, non-allergen restaurant categories, and automatic allergy information notifications. Usability testing revealed that the design effectively fulfilled usability goals, with a 100% task completion rate, and was easy to use, obtaining a SEQ score of 6.68 out of 7. The design also had a low learning curve and scored 2.65 out of 3 on the UEQ for the efficiency subscale. Additionally, the interaction design met user experience goals, being rated as helpful with a UEQ score of 2.5 out of 3 for dependability and 2.23 out of 3 for perspicuity, and satisfying with a UEQ score of 2.47 out of 3 for attractiveness and 2.5 out of 3 for stimulation. Overall, the interaction design received a SUS score of 84.5 out of 100, surpassing the average SUS score of 68. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Introduction: Virtual clinics are an emerging form of telemedicine which can positively impact healthcare accessibility in remote, rural, and underserved areas. However, a virtual clinic system for these contexts must be designed appropriately. The user-centered design method can be employed to develop an appropriate virtual clinic. Methods: The development of the virtual clinic used the user-centered design method. First, a situational analysis was conducted to understand the context of public primary healthcare facilities in South Africa. Literature review, observations, and interviews were conducted, which then informed system requirements. A virtual clinic system was then developed and its usability was evaluated with doctors and nurses in a lab setting using healthy participants acting as patients. Doctors and nurses completed system usability scale surveys and provided interview feedback. Results: The situational analysis revealed 10 key themes which were translated into a problem statement and 10 system requirements. A virtual clinic system was then developed based on these requirements. 5 doctors and 11 nurses were recruited to complete usability testing with the system. The system received an average of 80.6 scores (good to excellent) out of 100 on the system usability scale. Feedback from participants revealed key areas for improvement of the virtual clinic system, as well as opportunities for further implementation. Conclusion: The developed virtual clinic system demonstrated the application of the user-centered design method to telemedicine technologies for remote, rural, and underserved areas. The positive feedback received from the participants demonstrated the importance of the user-centered design method in developing technologies for enhancing service delivery in health systems. Further work will implement this system in real-world clinical settings. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The endangerment of Indonesian local languages is an issue requiring urgent attention. In response, the Indonesian government has initiated several revitalization movements, including the development and implementation of local language curricula in schools. However, challenges remain, particularly the lack of motivation among students to learn these languages. One way to address this issue is by using a more engaging learning approach through the utilization of technology. This paper addresses the challenge of designing a mobile learning app for Indonesian local languages, with a focus on Javanese as the sample language, employing a user-centered design approach. The MDA (mechanics, dynamics, aesthetic) framework is utilized to create an engaging and enjoyable learning experience, aimed at increasing student motivation. The final product is a high-fidelity prototype evaluated using two usability testing methods: the Single Ease Question (SEQ) and the System Usability Scale (SUS). The final prototype achieved an average SEQ score of 6.93 out of 7 and an average SUS of 95 out of 100. Additionally, an evaluation of the gamification element was conducted to assess their impact on student motivation. The results demonstrate that the prototype meets the usability goals of being easy to learn, and also achieved the user experience goals which are fun, motivating, and cognitively stimulating.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to contribute to the debate on the usefulness of public libraries. Through a literature review, we document the shift in their core mission as they transition from codex curators to community builders. This reflects a change in service logic, moving away from the mobilization of technical capabilities in a low interactivity context and toward the mobilization of human capabilities in a high interactivity context. Public libraries now stand as social innovators in that their activities modify interaction patterns among individuals. As a consequence, they stand as key players in the knowledge economy. © 2024 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Theories, models and frameworks (TMFs) are useful when implementing, evaluating and sustaining healthcare evidence-based interventions. Yet it can be challenging to identify an appropriate TMF for an implementation project. We developed and tested the usability of an online tool to help individuals who are doing or supporting implementation practice activities to identify appropriate models and/or frameworks to inform their work. Methods: We used methods guided by models and evidence on implementation science and user-centered design. Phases of tool development included applying findings from a scoping review of TMFs and interviews with 24 researchers/implementers on barriers and facilitators to identifying and selecting TMFs. Based on interview findings, we categorized the TMFs by aim, stage of implementation, and target level of change to inform the tool’s algorithm. We then conducted interviews with 10 end-users to test the usability of the prototype tool and administered the System Usability Scale (SUS). Usability issues were addressed and incorporated into the tool. Results: We developed Find TMF, an online tool consisting of 3–4 questions about the user’s implementation project. The tool’s algorithm matches key characteristics of the user’s project (aim, stage, target change level) with characteristics of different TMFs and presents a list of candidate models/frameworks. Ten individuals from Canada or Australia participated in usability testing (mean SUS score 84.5, standard deviation 11.4). Overall, participants found the tool to be simple, easy to use and visually appealing with a useful output of candidate models/frameworks to consider for an implementation project. Users wanted additional instruction and guidance on what to expect from the tool and how to use the information in the output table. Tool improvements included incorporating an overview figure outlining the tool steps and output, displaying the tool questions on a single page, and clarifying the available functions of the results page, including adding direct links to the glossary and to complementary tools. Conclusions: Find TMF is an easy-to-use online tool that may benefit individuals who support implementation practice activities by making the vast number of models and frameworks more accessible, while also supporting a consistent approach to identifying and selecting relevant TMFs. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - In various technology-enhanced learning (TEL) environments, knowledge co-creation progresses through multimodal interactions that integrate verbal and nonverbal modalities, such as speech and gestures. This study investigated two distinct analytical approaches for analyzing multimodal interactions—triangulating and interleaving—by applying them to collaborative learning processes during an online embodied mathematics intervention. The findings demonstrate that the interleaving approach captures the temporal dynamics and nuanced interplay between multimodal events, providing deeper insights into how shared meaning-making evolves over time. In contrast, the triangulating approach effectively identifies cumulative interaction patterns but does not account for their temporal structure. Specifically, the interleaving approach, employing epistemic network analysis, revealed statistically significant differences in discourse patterns between learners with larger and smaller variances in upper body movements during the co-design activity. These findings underscore the complementary value of the interleaving approach in analyzing multimodal interactions and offer practical implications for advancing understanding of collaborative learning processes in TEL environments. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Background: The prevalent use of smartphones has contributed to a rise in mobile gaming addiction, especially in young people. This study aimed to describe the design of an enhanced version of the AI-based mGaming Wellness mobile app, to support young individuals in developing healthy mobile gaming habits. Methods: The study utilised a 4-phased methodology, based on user-centred design principles, the Mobile App Rating Scale, a focus group and in-depth interviews with the app's target audience, and a think-aloud method. Results: The first round of refinement of mGaming Wellness, guided by input from an expert panel, focused on enhancing engagement and information quality. Feedback led to the identification of 5 key components for digital interventions, including mood and sleep trackers, a statistics dashboard, and educational modules tailored to young users' needs. Subsequent user research prompted the simplification of mood trackers and adjustments in educational content to align closely with adolescents' experiences. Usability testing of a high-fidelity prototype highlighted the app's ease of use and identified areas for further improvement, particularly in understanding how to reduce gaming time and effectively manage gaming-related notifications. The refined mGaming Wellness app can be a valuable resource for mental health professionals, educators, and youngsters seeking support with problematic mobile gaming or interested in building healthy digital habits. Discussion: The findings advocate for the user-centred techniques in developing digital health interventions, contributing valuable input for research in mental health app development targeted at adolescents. Future research will evaluate the app's effectiveness in reducing problematic gaming behaviour. © 2024

AB  - The factory floor is experiencing growing automation, which requires thorough training for workers to adapt to these advancements. This paper presents a part of a research project focused on developing a training interface (TI) utilizing Augmented Reality (AR) for workers in the furniture manufacturing industry. The research adopts a human-centered approach, incorporating co-creation sessions with stakeholders and usability testing. The objective is to design an AR interface that aligns with user needs and preferences, thereby enhancing efficiency, user experience, and satisfaction. Preliminary usability tests involved twelve participants using a low-fidelity prototype and six participants using a mid-fidelity prototype. The findings suggest that a well-designed AR training interface, developed in collaboration with users, can enhance the training experience on the factory floor, making it more satisfactory and leading to better acceptance. Future work will focus on further refining the interface based on continuous user feedback and expanding the application to other industrial tasks. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Despite growing efforts to prioritize user experience in product development, software organizations often perform little or no usability engineering activities. Therefore, it is crucial to develop strategies to integrate them effectively into software development processes. The rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence have significantly influenced various aspects of daily life, particularly with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which can serve as promising tools to support activities to enhance the usability of software products. This paper presents a study investigating the potential of LLMs to assist practitioners in conducting usability tests. Specifically, we conducted an experiment where LLMs generate usability test tasks. Our goal is to assess whether AI can effectively support evaluators by comparing tasks generated by LLMs to those defined by usability experts. The findings indicate that while LLMs can provide valuable support, effective usability testing still requires human oversight and expert intervention. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Immigrant populations with limited English proficiency (LEP) confront more challenges than those with English proficiency in using healthcare technology in the U.S. Our case study, conducted in collaboration with the Immigrant Health and Cancer Disparities (IHCD) Center at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), explores how LEP patients interact with patient portals translated in their preferred language. Through semi-structured interviews and usability testing, we found that individuals with LEP 1) encounter usability barriers during patient portal enrollment, 2) perceive increased self-efficacy and trust in using translated patient portals, and 3) greatly depend on caregivers for patient-provider communication and use of patient portals without translations. Based on these results, we offer recommendations for enhancing patient portal adoption among patients with LEP, share insights gained from applying User-Centered Design (UCD) methodologies with this user group, and discuss opportunities for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research to empower this user group and mitigate health disparities. © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - Online learning's popularity has surged. However, teachers face the challenge of the lack of non-verbal communication with students, making it difficult to perceive their learning-centered affective states (LCAS), leading to missed intervention opportunities. Addressing this challenge requires a system that detects students' LCAS from their non-verbal cues and informs teachers in an actionable way. To design such a system, it is essential to explore field experts' needs and requirements. Therefore, we conducted design-based research focus groups with teachers to determine which LCAS they find important to know during online lectures and their preferred communication methods. The results indicated that confusion, engagement, boredom, frustration, and curiosity are the most important LCAS and that the proposed system should take into account teachers' cognitive load and give them autonomy in the choice of content and frequency of the information. Considering the obtained feedback, a prototype of two versions was developed. The prototype was evaluated by teachers utilizing the System Usability Scale (SUS). Results indicated an average SUS score of 80.5 and 74.5 for each version, suggesting acceptable usability. These findings can guide the design and development of a system that can help teachers recognize students' LCAS, thus improving synchronous online learning. © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - Diabetes management applications effectively help patients monitor blood glucose levels and adjust diet and exercise plans. However, most diabetes management apps, including the SugarShift application developed in 2023, use generalized designs that often fail to consider the unique cognitive and physiological characteristics of elderly users, thereby impacting their acceptance and usage. This paper proposes an enhancement for the SugarShift application by introducing a mode specifically designed for elderly users. This proposed enhancement aims to directly involve elderly patients so as to meet their needs better through a participatory design approach. A heuristic evaluation conducted with six experts identified 126 usability issues and 179 heuristic violations in the current version, which has led to the recommendation to develop optimization strategies tailored for elderly users. Subsequent usability testing with 28 elderly patients and six experts emphasized the importance of interface simplicity, logical operation, and interaction quality in enhancing user experience. These factors improve usability, facilitate information processing, and reduce cognitive load. Despite the overall usability of SUS scores, significant challenges still need to be addressed in information display, system feedback, and user interaction. Recommendations for future enhancements include simplifying data entry and presentation, improving readability, and providing timely feedback to enhance usability and user satisfaction, ultimately increasing user retention. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Automated vehicle (AV) acceptance relies on their understanding via feedback. While visualizations aim to enhance user understanding of AV's detection, prediction, and planning functionalities, establishing an optimal design is challenging. Traditional "one-size-fits-all"designs might be unsuitable, stemming from resource-intensive empirical evaluations. This paper introduces OptiCarVis, a set of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approaches using Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) to optimize AV feedback visualizations. We compare conditions using eight expert and user-customized designs for a Warm-Start HITL MOBO. An online study (N=117) demonstrates OptiCarVis's efficacy in significantly improving trust, acceptance, perceived safety, and predictability without increasing cognitive load. OptiCarVis facilitates a comprehensive design space exploration, enhancing in-vehicle interfaces for optimal passenger experiences and broader applicability. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The growing elderly population presents significant challenges for health and nutrition management, particularly in maintaining dietary balance and nutrient intake. This study aims to develop a mobile nutrition calculator application tailored to elderly users by integrating User-Centered Design (UCD) and Design Thinking methodologies. The research employs a mixed-method approach comprising five phases: context analysis, requirement specification, user modeling, interface design, and usability testing. A total of 30 elderly participants were engaged through interviews, prototyping, and usability testing. Findings highlight critical usability issues specific to the elderly, including visual, cognitive, and interactional limitations. The application was developed using Kotlin and Firebase, with interface elements designed via Figma to ensure clarity and accessibility. Usability results showed high satisfaction (Mean=4.42, SD=0.51) and effective user engagement, with the integrated design approach outperforming conventional development strategies. This study contributes a practical framework for age-friendly digital health design, emphasizing the synergistic strengths of UCD and Design Thinking in addressing elderly-specific usability needs. The findings offer insights for developers, researchers, and health practitioners seeking to improve digital health tools for aging populations. © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems increasingly influence high-stakes decision-making, necessitating explainability tailored to non-technical users. This research investigates integrating cognitive theories, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles, and Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance user perception, a core cognitive function. A perception-focused framework was developed and tested using a medical symptom checker tool. The study involved 20 participants divided into control and experimental groups. The experimental group used an enhanced tool with features like visual hierarchy and consistency, while the control group used a basic version with minimal explainability. Participants completed pre-test, testing, and post-test phases, including surveys and objective tasks measuring recognition and recall. Results showed that 90% of the experimental group achieved "Good Performance" in recognition tasks compared to 20% in the control group. Subjective feedback indicated significantly higher un-derstandability, with an average rating of 4.8 out of 5 for the enhanced tool versus 3.1 for the control. These findings underscore the effectiveness of combining HCI principles and cognitive theories, such as Gestalt and Feature Integration, in reducing cognitive load and improving clarity. This multidisciplinary approach advances the design of intuitive, user-centered AI systems, fostering trust and accessibility. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Electronic medical record (EMR) systems are pivotal in modern healthcare for digitizing patient records and improving clinical workflows. However, persistent usability challenges hinder their effective adoption and user satisfaction. This study employs a comprehensive user-centered design approach to identify and address usability issues in one such EHR, an open-source system named openEMR. Our main objective was to assess openEMR’s usability through several usability metrics. In addition to a summative usability test with 10 participants, we employed usability inspection (i.e., a heuristic evaluation) to generate additional findings using multiple methods. The results from the summative usability test provide a comprehensive perspective on openEMR’s performance. In addition to task-specific observations, participants offered insights into openEMR’s overall usability through a debrief interview. Through quantitative surveys, usability testing, qualitative interviews, and a heuristic evaluation, this study identified critical usability issues, proposes targeted solutions, and discusses implications for enhancing EMR systems in healthcare settings. © 2024 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

AB  - Background: Fentanyl test strips (FTS) are a forensic tool designed for laboratory testing of urine samples. They have been adapted into a point-of-consumption drug-checking tool to detect illegally manufactured fentanyl in local drug supply. This creates unknown usability challenges for people who use drugs (PWUD). To assess ease of use in real-world settings, we conducted usability testing of five FTS brands. Methods: Six researchers independently completed a REDCap survey to evaluate usability of five FTS brands before and after testing a baking soda sample prepared in their homes. The survey first assessed ease of use of specific brand features, then usability of each brand as an interactive system with the System Usability Scale (SUS). Results: DanceSafe scored highest on ease of use ratings and highest on the SUS (above the usability threshold of ≤68). Dosetest scored lowest on ease of use ratings and below the SUS usability threshold. Respondents identified usability challenges with all brands, including difficulty opening single-strip envelopes, complex instruction design, and instruction discrepancies. Design of all brands assumes users have required testing resources (e.g. water, measuring tools, an Internet connection, and a timer), yet no brand provides these. Conclusions: FTS are complex interactive systems not fully adapted for testing in real-world settings. The complexity of FTS may lead to testing error or limit their adoption by PWUD. We encourage manufacturers to design FTS directly for PWUD by considering resource limitations of real-world testing settings, human factors, and local supply complexity. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction We present a prototype solution for improving transparency and quality assurance of the data linkage process through data provenance tracking designed to assist Data Analysts, researchers and information governance teams in authenticating and auditing data workflows within a Trusted Research Environment (TRE). Methods Using a participatory design process with Data Analysts, researchers and information governance teams, we undertook a contextual inquiry, user requirements interviews, co-design workshops, low-fidelity prototype evaluations. Public Engagement and Involvement activities underpinned the methods to ensure the project and approaches met the public’s trust for semi-automating data processing. These helped inform methods for technical implementation, applying the PROV-O ontology to create a derived ontology following the four-step Linked Open Terms methodology and development of automated scripts to collect provenance information for the data processing workflow. Results The resulting Provenance Explorer for Trusted Research Environments (PE-TRE) interactive tool displays the data linkage information extracted from a knowledge graph described using the derived SHP ontology and results of rule-based validation checks. User evaluations confirmed PE-TRE would contribute to better quality data linkage and reduce data processing errors. Conclusion This project demonstrates the next stage in advancing transparency and quality assurance within TREs by semi-automating and systematising data tracking in a single tool throughout the data processing lifecycle, improving transparency, openness and quality assurance. © The Authors.

AB  - Previous research has shown that there are a variety of eHealth usability evaluation methods suitable for agile, easily applicable, and useful eHealth usability evaluations. However, it is unclear whether such eHealth usability evaluation methods are also applicable with elderly users. This study aims to examine the challenges in applying eHealth usability evaluation methods with elderly users and how these challenges can be overcome. We chose three established eHealth usability evaluation methods to evaluate an eHealth intervention: (1) Co-Discovery Evaluation, (2) Cooperative Usability Testing, and (3) Remote User Testing combined with Think Aloud. The case study was conducted with seven Austrian elderly users. We supplemented the case study (March, 2021) with a systematic review (March, 2022) to identify (1) applied eHealth usability evaluation methods to elderly and (2) challenges of eHealth usability evaluations with elderly. Our results showed that Remote User Testing combined with Think Aloud could successfully be applied to evaluate the eHealth intervention with elderly users. However, Cooperative Usability Testing and Co-Discovery Evaluation were not suitable. The results of the systematic review showed that user-based eHealth usability evaluation methods are mostly applied to conduct eHealth usability evaluations with elderly users. Overall, the results showed that not all established eHealth usability evaluation methods are applicable with elderly users. Based on the case study and the systematic review, we developed 24 recommendations on how to deal with challenges during eHealth usability evaluations. The recommendations contribute to improving the accessibility, acceptability, and usability of eHealth interventions by the elderly. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - People with visual impairments face significant challenges during travel, and traditional navigation systems often fall short of addressing their specific needs. Existing assistive technologies, including tactile paths and basic voice navigation, struggle with low efficiency, high error rates, and heavy cognitive and psychological burdens. With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), AI-based navigation systems have emerged as promising alternatives by offering real-time environmental perception, personalized feedback, and adaptive interaction. This study compared AI navigation systems, existing assistive systems, and traditional navigation tools using five performance metrics: navigation time, error rate, task completion rate, psychological burden, and cognitive load. A four-week experiment involving 36 visually impaired participants revealed that the AI navigation system significantly improved task efficiency and reduced both cognitive and psychological stress. Notably, participants with total blindness outperformed semi-blind participants in task performance, emphasizing the effectiveness of voice-based navigation. These findings highlight the superior adaptability and user-centered design of AI navigation systems and underscore their value in enhancing travel independence and quality of life for the visually impaired. The results provide empirical support for advancing AI-driven assistive technologies and contribute to future developments in inclusive, barrier-free navigation design. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Vertical data flows (e.g., those directed toward companies) are challenging to understand even for technically knowledgeable adults, exposing them to privacy risks. Vulnerable groups with limited experience or cognitive abilities face even greater risks. To support these users in protecting their privacy online, it is essential to understand their perceptions of data flows and privacy needs. This dissertation employs a mixed-method participatory approach involving children, seniors, and individuals with cognitive disabilities. Initial focus groups have explored their understanding of vertical data flows, privacy risks, and protective measures. Building on these insights, co-creation workshops aim to develop tangible cues that enhance privacy awareness, literacy, and self-efficacy with minimum cognitive load. The effectiveness of these tools will be tested longitudinally, allowing iterative improvements to better suit the needs of these vulnerable groups. The goal is to achieve comprehensive and diverse empowerment, ensuring tailored privacy protection for everyone. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND:  Nurses adjust intravenous nitroglycerin infusions to provide acute relief for angina by manually increasing or decreasing the dosage. However, titration can pose challenges, as excessively high doses can lead to hypotension, and low doses may result in inadequate pain relief. Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) that predict changes in blood pressure for nitroglycerin dose adjustments may assist nurses with titration. OBJECTIVE:  This study aimed to design a user interface for a CDSS for nitroglycerin dose titration (Nitroglycerin Dose Titration Decision Support System [nitro DSS]). METHODS:  A user-centered design (UCD) approach, consisting of an initial qualitative study with semistructured interviews to identify design specifications for prototype development, was used. This was followed by three iterative rounds of usability testing. Nurses with experience titrating nitroglycerin infusions in coronary care units participated. RESULTS:  A total of 20 nurses participated, including 7 during the qualitative study and 15 during usability testing (2 nurses participated in both phases). Analysis of the qualitative data revealed four themes for the interface design to be (1) clear and consistent, (2) vigilant, (3) interoperable, and (4) reliable. The major elements of the final prototype included a feature for viewing the predicted and actual blood pressure over time to determine the reliability of the predictions, a drop-down option to report patient side effects, a feature to report reasons for not accepting the prediction, and a visual alert indicating any systolic blood pressure predictions below 90 mm Hg. Nurses' ratings on the questionnaires indicated excellent usability and acceptability of the final nitro DSS prototype. CONCLUSION:  This study successfully applied a UCD approach to collaborate with nurses in developing a user interface for the nitro DSS that supports the clinical decision-making of nurses titrating nitroglycerin.

AB  - The MindMe project, related to the development of a tool system Inventory for Supported Psychological Evaluation (iSpe®), aims to design and develop a digital tool for the assessment of mental illness in people with cognitive challenges. In this paper, we describe and discuss experiences from the project over the last three years, with a primary focus on end-user involvement. Results indicated that active user participation provided new insights at all stages of development. User feedback supplemented previous research findings and accessibility guidelines, ensuring that the solutions met the actual needs of the target audience. Usability testing and feasibility studies confirmed the tool's effectiveness in enhancing comprehension and articulation of mental health symptoms among users. However, challenges such as response difficulties to symptom severity and reluctance to use audio support were also identified. The project advances the understanding of user-centered design in psychological test development for individuals with NDD by documenting iterative feedback loops and user-centered approach that offers a practical framework for future projects. The collaborative approach ensured that the developed tool was clinically relevant, user-friendly and accessible, and can serve as a model for future projects.  © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - In the realm of digital ecosystems, integrating Lean UX principles into virtual environments for older adults presents a promising avenue for enhancing cognitive health and addressing neurocognitive disorders. This research builds on the foundation that virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies can significantly improve the quality of life for the elderly, fostering social interaction and cognitive stimulation. Despite the proven efficacy of VR and AR in engaging older adults, there remains a gap in applying Lean UX methodologies to optimize these digital experiences. This study investigates the incorporation of Lean UX into digital ecosystems for older adults, tailoring virtual environments to their unique needs and preferences, thereby aiding in the treatment and management of neurocognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Employing a user-centered design approach, iterative prototyping, and multidisciplinary collaboration, the research analyzes variables such as user engagement, adaptability, cognitive load, accessibility metrics, and user satisfaction. Findings reveal that Lean UX leads to more intuitive, accessible, and personalized VR interfaces, increasing user satisfaction and potentially mitigating neurocognitive decline effects. The implications underscore empathetic design in creating inclusive digital solutions that support older adults' well-being and independence. Future work involves fieldwork to validate and refine the digital ecosystem model in real-world settings. © 2025 Latin American Center for Informatics Studies. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Globally, mental health (MH) problems increasingly affect young people, contributing significantly to disability and disease. In low- and middle-income countries, such as Colombia, barriers to accessing care exacerbate the treatment gap. In addition, the lack of widespread digital interventions further deepens the digital health divide between the Global North and Global South, limiting equitable access to innovative MH solutions. Objective: This study aims to co-design and develop an MH platform using participatory design methodologies and conduct a 15-month naturalistic observational trial to assess its feasibility among Colombian youth. Methods: This study used a mixed methods approach within a structured research and development cycle. To ensure a user-centered design, we began with a series of co-design workshops, where stakeholders collaboratively identified key user needs. Following this, usability testing was conducted in 2 stages, alpha and beta, using the System Usability Scale (SUS) to assess functionality and user experience. To capture real-world interactions, a naturalistic observational trial ran from July 2022 to October 2023, collecting data on user engagement and system performance. This study integrated quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results: A total of 146 individuals participated in the co-design process, with 110 (75.3%) contributing to the development of platform components and 36 (24.7%) participating in usability testing. The co-designed platform integrated several key features, including social media and advertising, an MH screening tool, registration, targeted psychoeducational resources, automated tailored recommendations, and a “track-as-you-go” feature for continuous MH monitoring. Additional elements included user-friendly follow-up graphs, telecounseling integration, customizable well-being nudges, an emergency button, and gamification components to enhance engagement. During usability testing, the beta prototype received a median SUS score of 85.0 (IQR 80-92.5), indicating high usability. In the subsequent observational trial, which ran from July 2022 to October 2023, a total of 435 users interacted with the platform—314 (72.2%) as registered users and 121 (27.8%) anonymously. Emotional distress was prevalent, with 63.7% (200/314) of the registered users and 61.2% (74/121) of the anonymous users reporting distress, as measured by the 6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. Despite 102 users requesting telecounseling, only 26.5% (27/102) completed a session. While usability scores remained high, engagement challenges emerged, with only 18.8% (59/314) of the users continuing platform use beyond the first day. Conclusions: This study explored the development and user experience of a youth MH platform in Colombia, demonstrating that a cocreation approach is both feasible and effective. By actively involving users throughout the design process, the platform achieved high usability and incorporated features that resonated with its target audience. However, sustaining long-term engagement remains a challenge, as does addressing privacy concerns, particularly for younger users. These findings highlight the importance of continuous user-centered refinement to enhance both accessibility and retention in digital MH interventions. © Laura Ospina-Pinillos, Débora L Shambo-Rodríguez, Mónica Natalí Sánchez-Nítola, Alexandra Morales, Laura C Gallego-Sanchez, María Isabel Riaño-Fonseca, Andrea Carolina Bello-Tocancipá, Alvaro Navarro-Mancilla, Jaime A Pavlich-Mariscal, Alexandra Pomares-Quimbaya, Carlos Gómez-Restrepo, Ian B Hickie, Jo-An Occhipinti.

AB  - As artifcial intelligence (AI) increasingly permeates everyday life, there is a growing need for public understanding of AI’s underlying principles. Existing educational interventions and explainable AI (XAI) tools cater mainly to children or adult experts. In this paper, we present three interactive web-based tools to foster AI learning among adults without technical backgrounds. Designed according to learning sciences and user-centered design principles, these tools simplify complex AI concepts like edge detection, confdence thresholds, and sensitivity, making AI more understandable for beginners and facilitating refection on ethical issues. We present results from a mixed-methods evaluation of the tools with 42 participants. Results show heightened familiarity and confdence in AI concepts. Our qualitative analysis additionally reveals common interaction patterns amongst participants. This paper ofers both a design contribution to the AI education and XAI communities and emergent interaction patterns to support the design of transparent and learner-centered AI for adult novices. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - As users transition from passive subjects to active partners in the co-design process, they bring unique insights based on their experiences, collaboratively envisioning a better future with designers. However, unlike designers who are adept at various forms of representation, most users lack advanced modeling or sketching skills to concretely present the three-dimensional (3D) forms or dynamic features of a design proposal. This hinders user expression and increases the cognitive load on designers, thereby reducing communication efficiency in the co-design process. Mixed Reality (MR) technology enables users to depict 3D information in real physical space using natural gestures. This means that MR can provide a low-learning-cost concrete expression method without compromising traditional communication methods. This study explores the role of MR in enhancing communication between designers and users during the early stages of design. A formative study was conducted to identify four key requirements, which informed the development of the DuoMR system. DuoMR supports designers and users in expressing design ideas through gesture modeling in a collaborative MR space. Results from the user study and practical case study show that DuoMR effectively reduces cognitive load and enhances mutual understanding during the co-design process. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The research focuses on the limitations of traditional systems in optimizing information flow in the healthcare domain. It focuses on integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) and utilizing AI-powered applications, specifically conversational agents (CAs), particularly during peak operational hours in emergency departments (EDs). Leveraging the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework, the authors tailored a customized methodology, CRISP-knowledge graph (CRISP-KG), designed to harness KGs for constructing an intelligent knowledge base (KB) for CAs. This KG augmentation empowers CAs with advanced reasoning, knowledge management, and context awareness abilities. We utilized a hybrid method integrating a participatory design collaborative methodology (CM) and Methontology to construct a domain-centric robust formal ontological model depicting and mapping information flow during peak hours in EDs. The ultimate objective is to empower CAs with intelligent KBs, enabling seamless interaction with end users and enhancing the quality of care within EDs. The authors leveraged semantic web rule language (SWRL) to enhance inferencing capabilities within the KG framework further, facilitating efficient information management for assisting healthcare practitioners and patients. This innovative assistive solution helps efficiently manage information flow and information provision during peak hours. It also leads to better care outcomes and streamlined workflows within EDs. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Current tablet-based interfaces for drone operations often impose a heavy cognitive load on pilots and reduce situational awareness by dividing attention between the video feed and the real world. To address these challenges, we designed a heads-up augmented reality (AR) interface that overlays in-situ information to support drone pilots in safety-critical tasks. Through participatory design workshops with professional pilots, we identified key features and developed an adaptive AR interface that dynamically switches between task and safety views to prevent information overload. We evaluated our prototype by creating a realistic building inspection task and comparing three interfaces: a 2D tablet, a static AR, and our adaptive AR design. A user study with 15 participants showed that the AR interface improved access to safety information, while the adaptive AR interface reduced cognitive load and enhanced situational awareness without compromising task performance. We offer design insights for developing safety-first heads-up AR interfaces. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Mobile applications have become essential tools for information dissemination and task execution, particularly during emergencies like evacuations. The design of these applications, guided by Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and User-Centered Design (UCD) principles, can greatly enhance user safety and performance in such critical scenarios. This paper investigates the application of HCI and UCD methodologies in developing a mobile app specifically for emergency evacuations. We propose various interface strategies, such as dynamic maps with real-time updates versus static maps with pre-determined routes, to assess their effectiveness in aiding user decision-making during evacuations. Additionally, we emphasize iterative prototyping, usability testing, and real-time feedback to refine the application and improve the user experience and evacuation strategy. Furthermore, we address the challenges of deploying these systems in diverse indoor environments, including infrastructure constraints, real-time data accuracy, and privacy concerns. Our research provides valuable insights into creating intuitive, accessible, and effective evacuation apps, with the ultimate goal of improving evacuation strategies and ensuring user safety during emergencies.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The rapid advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology has opened new possibilities for creating immersive and interactive experiences across various fields. This research addresses the challenge of enhancing visitor experiences at a large 13.9-hectare zoo in Surakarta, where exploring the entire area on foot can be tiring, especially in unfavorable weather. To solve this problem, the study developed Anima Safari, a VR application aimed at providing an engaging and educational exploration of wildlife in a simulated environment, thereby bridging the gap between entertainment and education. The application enables users to interact with diverse animal species and learn about their behaviors and habitats in an immersive way. The development process employed the Design Thinking methodology, which involved iterative prototyping and continuous refinement based on user feedback. Key stages included empathy-building, problem definition, ideation, prototyping, and testing. Usability testing was conducted using the Slovin formula to determine the sample size, involving 33 participants who provided quantitative feedback. The testing focused on four aspects: Learnability, Flexibility, Effectiveness, and Attitude. Results showed an overall usability score of 79.05%, indicating that Anima Safari is effective in delivering an educational and engaging experience. Strengths identified include the application's ability to provide a realistic and enjoyable safari experience, while areas for improvement were noted in navigation and system notifications. This study demonstrates the value of integrating Design Thinking and usability testing in VR application development, contributing to best practices for creating user-centered applications that meet educational and entertainment needs. Recommendations for future work include optimizing file size for better performance and expanding usability tests with larger user groups. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - [Purpose/ significance] Quickly and accurately identifying valuable content from massive multi-modal data is of great significance for promoting knowledge dissemination and improving output quality. [Method/ process] Focusing on the dual promotion mechanism of “user + multi-modal knowledge” in knowledge co-creation from the perspective of interpretability. Firstly, relying on BERT + BiLSTM and ResNet models to extract text and image features separately to obtain multi-modal knowledge vector representations. Secondly, based on social cognitive theory, user behavior is analyzed, and DeepFM is used to capture the correlation between interactive features and generate user vector representations. Again, using K-BERT to embed knowledge graphs into text data, external knowledge vector representations are obtained. Finally, based on the multi-head attention mechanism, various dimensional feature vectors are fused, and the recognition of value content is completed by dynamically adjusting weights. [Result/ conclusion] Through experiments using Meizu Flyme community data, the accuracy of the constructed fusion model reached 88. 31%. Compared with other baseline models and combination models, the evaluation indicators have improved to varying degrees, proving that embedding external knowledge and integrating text, images, and user attributes can effectively enhance the recognition effect of value. © 2024 Information studies: Theory and Application.

AB  - Personas are commonly used in User-centered Design (UCD) activities to help designers better understand users' needs. However, there is still a reliance on traditional approaches such as interviews and ethnography for building personas in UCD activities. To this end, we developed an auto-generating persona system to enhance practices in UCD course activities. Our persona system is developed based on the GPT-4 model, the DALL-E 2 model, and knowledge graphs. Hence, our persona system includes three main features of our persona system: automated processing of survey data, automatic generation of 2D avatars, and providing options for automatic or customized entity generation. We recruited a total of 22 participants to evaluate our persona system. Our findings confirmed that there was a significant difference in terms of efficiency, satisfaction, accuracy, and diversity. Meanwhile, participants provided both positive and negative feedback regarding our persona system. As on-going work, we discuss the current limitations of our persona system and explore future research directions to further improve its capabilities and effectiveness. © 2024 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - As cities embrace smart technologies for urban development, the demand for new urban mobility solutions grows. However, capturing and prioritising diverse citizen needs poses challenges. In response, we introduce a serious tabletop game tailored for urban mobility requirements engineering. Our research aims to design and evaluate the effectiveness of this game in facilitating user engagement and optimising the elicitation, prioritisation and analysis of requirements in the context of urban mobility solutions. Our approach builds on previous serious gaming studies while focusing on citizen engagement and customisation for urban contexts. The game comprises collaborative activities using a co-design canvas. Through iterative playtesting and usability testing, the game’s design is refined. © 2024 owner/author.

AB  - Self-localization and wayfinding are challenging tasks for people with visual impairments (PVIs), severely impacting independent mobility. Visual "You-are-here"(YAH) maps are useful for assisting local wayfinding of sighted users. They are used to self-localize and display points of interest, landmarks and routes in the surroundings. However, these maps are not always available and rarely accessible to PVIs. Relying on an iterative participatory design process with eight end-users with visual impairments, we created a proof of concept of a mobile audio-vibratory YAH map. Our design is based on either a tablet or a smartphone to ensure a small and portable solution. A user study with ten PVIs showed that the audio-vibratory YAH map that we designed provides the user with a good understanding of the surroundings and wayfinding cues. Surprisingly, the results show that the audio-vibratory YAH map prototype was as usable as the control condition (audio-tactile YAH map with a tactile overlay), with similar user satisfaction and cognitive load. A follow-up field study with two participants showed the effectiveness of the prototype for assisting in crossroad understanding. To conclude, our innovative design of a mobile audio-vibratory YAH map can overcome the portability and printing issues associated with tactile overlays and can be an appropriate solution for assisting the pedestrian navigation of PVIs.  © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) are capable of generating cross-domain design knowledge, opening up new possibilities for creating a myriad of design concepts for early-stage design ideation. The current interfaces and interaction capabilities of LLMs, however, pose challenges in controlling the ideation process in terms of its diversity and quality. To enhance human guidance over the LLM-driven ideation process, we have developed ConceptVis, a system that organizes and symbiotically coordinates the LLM-generated design space through an interactive knowledge graph. In ConceptVis, designers can easily control the breadth and depth of the design space by intuitively prompting the LLM from the graph nodes. Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms extract concept keywords and related design knowledge from LLM responses, which are then added to the knowledge graph for visualization. We conducted a user study with 24 novice designers and compared the performance of ConceptVis with that of a chat-based LLM interface for concept generation. With ConceptVis, designers can explore the design space with a balance of breadth and depth. This approach prevents them from merely prompting the LLM to generate random concepts, struggling to keep track of what has been generated in long linear lists, or fixating on early ideas. Supporting users to interact with LLMs through an interactive visual interface significantly improves both the efficiency and quality of concept generation. This result highlights the importance of developing user-centered design systems to facilitate human-LLM collaboration during the early stages of design. Copyright © 2024 by ASME.

AB  - Background: Hospitals are transitioning away from traditional pagers to secure text messaging (STM) applications. STM is perceived to improve efficiency and accessibility. There is limited research on user's impressions of how STM impacts patient safety, provider wellness, and quality of patient care. Objectives: To understand the use and perceptions of a clinical STM by pediatric residents at a free-standing quaternary care children's hospital. Methods: A survey was conducted of pediatric residents regarding their experience with Diagnotes®. Demographic data were obtained along with use patterns, ability to perform tasks, and perceptions of intended purpose. Further questions evaluated agreement with communication strategies and satisfaction with features. Three open-ended questions asked about experience where STM impacted (1) patient care coordination and (2) patient safety. A final question asked for any additional STM feedback. Results: Of 169 surveys, there were 112 respondents (66.3 % response rate). Respondents unanimously endorsed daily STM use on their personal mobile devices with good knowledge of basic features. Respondents were overall satisfied with Diagnotes® (73.9 %) including the ability to communicate efficiently (84.8 %) and effectively (79.5 %). Yet only 32.1 % were satisfied with Diagnotes® training. Only 59.5 % believed Diagnotes® was appropriate for urgent patient care needs and only 43.2 % believed its purpose was to inform the team of patient emergencies. Key qualitative themes included improved coordination of patient care tasks through STM, but there were concerns raised around sending and receiving messages, the additional cognitive burden placed by STM, and differences in culture of use that created conflict. Conclusions: Diagnotes® is viewed positively including use for effective coordination of patient care and familiarity of functions of Diagnotes®. Barriers included unclear interprofessional expectations for use. Future research should incorporate a broad range of healthcare professionals' perceptions and co-creation of STM best practice guidelines for use, including around urgent or emergent patient care issues. © 2024

AB  - Text-to-image (T2I) models are emerging as a powerful tool for designers to create user interface (UI) prototypes from natural language inputs (i.e., prompts). However, the discrepancy between designer inputs and model-preferred prompts makes it challenging for designers to consistently deliver effective results to end users. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel hybrid method that assists designers in crafting user-centric prompts for T2I models, ensuring that the generated UIs align with end-user expectations. First, this method merges text mining and Kansei Engineering (KE) to analyze online user reviews and construct a Knowledge Graph (KG), mapping the intricate relationships between diverse affective requirements of users, design features, and corresponding text prompts for UI generation. Then, our approach automatically transforms designer inputs into model-preferred prompts through entity mention recognition and entity linking during the human-AI collaborative design process. Finally, we validate the proposed approach with a case study on automotive human–machine interface design. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high performance in perceived efficiency, satisfaction, and expectation disconfirmation. Overall, this study represents a step forward in integrating human and AI contributions in design and innovation within engineering disciplines, enabling AI to inspire, develop, and reinforce human creativity from a human factors perspective. © 2025

AB  - This paper presents a framework for adapting human-computer interaction for fault detection and diagnosis systems, aligning with Industry 5.0 principles. The proposed solution integrates user profiles, cognitive states, physical capacities, and real-time system data to enable context-aware and user-centered interfaces. Proof of concept presents the performance of the system in four use cases: visualization of historical events, performance metrics adjustment, maintenance dashboards for critical faults, and real-time alerts. Through these scenarios, an adaptive HCI can demonstrate potential improvements in usability, cognitive load, and decision-making. This is the first step towards harmonizing human-centric design and intelligent systems in intelligent manufacturing environments. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - The application of smart glasses in healthcare, particularly for providers engaged in hands-on patient care tasks, presents unique design challenges. This study combines participatory design and usability testing to assess the user experiences of touchless interaction methods for smart glasses in the context of Emergency Medical Services (EMS). The participatory design workshops with 16 EMS providers reveal a preference for touchless interaction methods such as voice commands and pinch hand gestures, driven by the need to keep hands free and minimize cross-contamination risk. Despite this preference, the laboratory-based usability testing with 16 EMS providers indicates that both voice commands and hand gestures fall short in task performance compared to the default tangible buttons on smart glasses, primarily due to software limitations and EMS providers’ unfamiliarity with touchless techniques. Our findings reveal specific issues associated with using different interaction methods when operating smart glasses. Building on these insights, we discuss design implications for smart glasses to better align with the dynamic and unique characteristics of fast-paced medical work. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper addresses the challenges and solutions in developing a holistic prevention mobile health application (mHealth app) for Germany’s healthcare sector. Despite Germany’s lag in healthcare digitalization, the app aims to enhance primary prevention in physical activity, nutrition, and stress management. A significant focus is on user participation and usability to counter the prevalent issue of user attrition in mHealth applications, as described by Eysenbach’s ‘law of attrition’. The development process, conducted in a scientific and university context, faces constraints like limited budgets and external service providers. The study firstly presents the structure and functionality of the app for people with statutory health insurance in Germany and secondly the implementation of user participation through a usability study. User participation is executed via usability tests, particularly the think-aloud method, where users verbalize their thoughts while using the app. This approach has proven effective in identifying and resolving usability issues, although some user feedback could not be implemented due to cost-benefit considerations. The implementation of this study into the development process was able to show that user participation, facilitated by methods like think-aloud, is vital for developing mHealth apps. Especially in health prevention, where long-term engagement is a challenge. The findings highlight the importance of allocating time and resources for user participation in the development of mHealth applications. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Objective: Advance care planning (ACP) is a dynamic communication process about future care preferences. We aimed to develop and test an ACP support website for people with dementia and their family caregivers. Methods: We adopted a user-centred design process to develop and test the ACP support website. A content specification phase included needs assessment, evidence synthesis and translation into preliminary content. A creative design phase included storyboarding, iterative prototyping, and usability testing. People with dementia and family caregivers engaged in usability testing across four iterations, using System Usability Scale questionnaires, and think-aloud and semi-structured interviews. An advisory group with people with dementia, family caregivers, and diverse regional stakeholders was involved. Descriptive statistics and qualitative framework analysis were applied. Results: Website goals were: providing ACP information and facilitating ACP conversations. A ‘what matters most’ approach (i.e. enabling users to reflect on ‘what matters most’ in the present and the future) and non-linear navigation were favoured. We tested the website with 17 people with dementia and 26 family caregivers. Feedback addressed design, navigation and content. Usability scores of 76.4 for family caregivers and 81.3 for people with dementia were achieved. Family caregivers and people with dementia highlighted the value of information and interactive ACP tools, the need for language simplification and harmonised layout. People with dementia experienced challenges in using interactive tools. Conclusion: The user-centred development process, involving diverse stakeholders, led to the development of an ACP support website deemed usable and useful. Future evaluation should focus on acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness of the ACP support website. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Traditional stroke rehabilitation methods are known to be limited to their accessibility for patients with mobility issues while lacking real-time feedback whereas a modern way as remote rehabilitation seems to be costly for some patients. The downsides of the previous method will eventually execute an impact to the patients' rehabilitation progress. To overcome the issue, as a starting point of this research, the proposed solution is a web-based medical information system that incorporates hand gesture recognition using MediaPipe and RIOT framework. Rehabilitation Internet-of-Things (RIOT) is an IoT system created to aid in remote rehabilitation, specifically targeting stroke survivors in remote areas and healthcare providers specialising in physiotherapy. This system offers a platform for stroke patients to perform rehabilitation exercises with real-time feedback. Additionally, in the making of a proper medical information system using web development technologies, the integration of MediaPipe and RIOT platform development using JavaScript or Python web integration. Moreover, surveys and usability testing were conducted to evaluate its effectiveness. Therefore, an innovative and cost- effective approach was developed to provide stroke rehabilitation by combining real-time feedback, and user- centred design, improving accessibility and effectiveness of stroke rehabilitation. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - As artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly mediate high-stakes decisions in domains such as healthcare, finance, and education, ensuring transparency and ethical accountability in AI interfaces is critical. However, existing interfaces often obscure algorithmic processes, leading to overtrust, disengagement, or misinterpretation of AI-generated outputs. My research explores how interface design—including presentation modes, interactive explainability tools, and speculative design interventions—can shape user perceptions, foster critical reflection, and enhance AI literacy. By integrating controlled experiments, participatory design, and qualitative analysis, my work aims to develop AI interfaces that not only communicate algorithmic decisions effectively but also encourage users to critically assess the ethical implications of AI technologies. I examine the trade-offs between transparency, usability, and engagement, investigating how interfaces can balance cognitive load while making ethical considerations more salient. Through this doctoral consortium, I seek mentorship and feedback on designing adaptive transparency mechanisms and mitigating overtrust in engaging AI interfaces. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - We present a prototype solution for improving transparency and quality assurance of the data linkage process through a data provenance dashboard designed to assist data analysts, researchers and information governance teams in authenticating and auditing data workflows within a trusted research environment (TRE). Building on prior research (Scheliga, et al., 2022), this work describes our first operationalised prototype tested in a real-world setting. The prototype development involved four stages: (1) Co-design of interfaces with end users for provenance data collection and visualisation, producing a low-fidelity design; (2) Extension and refinement of the Safe Haven Provenance (SHP) ontology (https://tre-provenance.github.io/SHP-ontology/releases/v0.2/index-en.html); (3) Design and implementation of mechanisms for semi-automated collection of data linkage provenance using the SHP ontology; (4) Implementation and user evaluation of the dashboard. A participatory design process with data analysts, researchers and information governance teams resulted in a low-fidelity prototype and was validated via public consultations to ensure it met public trust. The resulting prototype dashboard (https://tre-provenance.github.io/) was built as an offline desktop app to match the deployment TRE requirements. The interactive dashboard displays the data linkage information extracted from a knowledge graph described using the SHP ontology (e.g., modifications of datasets, data release) and results of rule-based validation checks (e.g., checking extracted data against researchers’ specification). User evaluations confirmed the dashboard would contribute to better quality of data linkage. This project demonstrates the next stage in advancing transparency and quality assurance within TREs by semi-automating and systematising data tracking from ingress to egress in a single tool. 2024 © The Authors.

AB  - This paper investigates the integration of emotional, cognitive, and interactional processes in the design of educational technologies through the lens of Human–Computer Interaction (HCI). While previous studies have focused on cognitive and interactional engagement, emotional engagement remains underdeveloped in many tools, limiting learning effectiveness. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a theoretical holistic framework integrating usability, emotional intelligence, and adaptive interaction. Through a qualitative analysis, we examine educational platforms—including Duolingo, Khan Academy, and Google Classroom—alongside simulation-based systems such as EduTechRPGs. The study applies Cognitive Load Theory, Emotional Intelligence Theory, and Self-Determination Theory to assess their effectiveness. The findings highlight the importance of designing emotionally intelligent, scalable, and adaptive learning environments, and the proposed framework integrates psychological principles to boost engagement, motivation, and learning outcomes. This study contributes to a learner-centered HCI approach, ensuring that educational technologies support both cognitive and emotional development. Future research should validate the proposed framework empirically and explore interdisciplinary approaches to optimize educational technology.

AB  - Soundscapes are widely used for relaxation, but their potential for personalized, navigable experiences remains under-explored. To address this, we developed Sonora, an AI tool that enables real-time generation of synthetic, spatialized soundscapes, allowing users to navigate immersive auditory environments and customize soundscapes using voice commands. Sonora's architecture integrates audio diffusion models and LLMs within Unity3D. A between-subjects study with 32 participants investigated its effects on anxiety and user experience, compared to a control condition involving passive listening to a soundscape. Participants who interacted with Sonora reported higher entertainment than the control group. A positive correlation was found between state anxiety and user requests for Sonora, suggesting anxious users engaged more. Participants with moderate to high trait anxiety experienced significant reductions in state anxiety across both conditions, with no significant difference in cognitive load. Our findings highlight Sonora's potential to promote relaxation, emphasizing the value of personalized experiences for mental health. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - In this study, we proposed an improved design strategy for enhancing the efficiency of, and satisfaction with, medical terminal use. Based on the geriatric mental model (GMM), we obtained the on-site mental information of elderly medical terminal users. Then, we coded the voice data obtained from our interviews and got the corresponding link node form. Subsequently, “Gephi” helped generate a clustered network of mental nodes. Finally, using the behavioral “affinity diagram”, we constructed a mental model (MM) of elderly patients using medical terminals for consultations, and accordingly, proposed a design strategy for an age-friendly medical terminal. The optimized medical terminal improves interface intuitiveness, feedback, and information architecture, reducing elderly users’ cognitive load. The added pop-up guide enhances usability and satisfaction. This study highlights how AUI and product design support age-friendly interaction and shows the value of MMs in improving elderly user experiences. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) play a pivotal role in health care by enhancing clinical decision-making processes. These systems represent a significant advancement in medical information systems. However, optimizing their effectiveness requires accounting for various human-computer interaction (HCI) elements that influence their functionality and user acceptance. Objective: This study aimed to identify and categorize key HCI elements that impact CDSS performance to enhance system usability, adaptability, and decision-making accuracy. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review, identifying 923 studies from the databases PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Papers were screened and selected based on predefined inclusion criteria. A rigorous quality assessment process was applied to ensure the relevance and reliability of the included studies. Ultimately, of the 923 papers identified, 43 (4.7%) that specifically addressed HCI elements applicable to CDSS environments were included in the final analysis. Data extraction and synthesis were performed to answer the research questions regarding HCI elements. Results: A total of 12 distinct HCI elements were identified, each with the potential to influence CDSS functionality. These elements align with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9241-11 framework, which defines usability in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. “User satisfaction,” “flexibility,” and “individuality” enhance satisfaction by improving system adaptability and user acceptance. “Visibility,” “explainability,” and “user control” strengthen effectiveness by supporting decision-making and error prevention. “Ease of use” improves efficiency by streamlining interactions and reducing cognitive load. Some elements influence effectiveness and efficiency, such as “data entry,” which ensures structured inputs for decision accuracy while optimizing workflows. Likewise, “alerts” provide timely information for effective decision-making and, simultaneously, are designed to avoid overwhelming users and maintain system efficiency. “Simplification” and “mental effort” also optimize workflows and reduce complexity. Furthermore, “interface” impacts effectiveness and efficiency by supporting accurate decision-making and streamlining user interaction. This categorization, aligned with ISO 9241-11, underscores the context and task dependency of usability, highlighting that HCI elements must be adapted to different user needs and environments for effective clinical decision-making. Conclusions: This study addresses a critical gap in CDSS research by offering a comprehensive framework of HCI elements tailored to the CDSS environment. Incorporating these elements into system design can improve user satisfaction, reduce data errors, and enhance the accuracy of medical decisions. The findings lay the groundwork for future research, offering practical guidelines for developing more reliable and efficient CDSS systems in medical informatics fields. © Ali Azadi, Francisco José García-Peñalvo.

AB  - Background Treatment of depressive symptoms in older adults is a growing public health concern. Collecting patient-reported outcomes (PROs) may facilitate efficiently scaling psychotherapy for older adults but user-specific tailoring is needed to improve completion. Objectives This study investigates (1) the effect of updating PRO collection tools for middle-aged and older adults with depressive symptoms through a user-centered design process on user completion of PRO questions, (2) what sociodemographic factors correspond with participant completion, and (3) how completion of PRO questions change during the course of a psychotherapy intervention. Methods Analysis was conducted on 139 middle-aged and older adults with depressive symptoms from three clinical trials at the Weill Cornell ALACRITY Center. Overall response percentages to daily PRO questionnaires were compared before and after the implementation of findings from a multiphase user-centered design process. Grouped least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was employed to examine which baseline factors correspond with patient completion and linear regression was conducted to explore the association. Changes in daily dichotomized completion over time were analyzed with mixed-effect logistic regression. Results After user-centered updates, there was a significantly higher (p < 0.001) percentage of completion (mean [standard deviation (SD)] percentage, 67.0 [35.6]%) than before (mean [SD] percentage, 24.9 [28.9]%). Additional years of education, age, and total annual household income greater than $25,000 were significant with completion percentage. Mixed-effects logistic regression showed that the odds of high completion increased each day (OR ¼ 1.019 [95% CI: 1.014, 1.023; p < 0.001]). Conclusion This study has shown that user-centered technology tailoring may be associated with increased PRO completion among middle-aged and older adults with depressive symptoms. PRO-supported psychotherapies are promising for middle-aged and older adults with depressive symptoms. Likewise, this study has demonstrated the potential benefits of employing a rigorous user-centered design process with PRO technology. © 2024. Thieme. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Integrating advanced machine-learning (ML) algorithms into clinical practice is challenging and requires interdisciplinary collaboration to develop transparent, interpretable, and ethically sound clinical decision support (CDS) tools. We aimed to design a ML-driven CDS tool to predict opioid overdose risk and gather feedback for its integration into the University of Florida Health (UFHealth) electronic health record (EHR) system. Methods: We used user-centered design methods to integrate the ML algorithm into the EHR system. The backend and UI design sub-teams collaborated closely, both informed by user feedback sessions. We conducted seven user feedback sessions with five UF Health primary care physicians (PCPs) to explore aspects of CDS tools, including workflow, risk display, and risk mitigation strategies. After customizing the tool based on PCPs’ feedback, we held two rounds of one-on-one usability testing sessions with 8 additional PCPs to gather feedback on prototype alerts. These sessions informed iterative UI design and backend processes, including alert frequency and reappearance circumstances. Results: The backend process development identified needs and requirements from our team, information technology, UFHealth, and PCPs. Thirteen PCPs (male = 62%, White = 85%) participated across 7 user feedback sessions and 8 usability testing sessions. During the user feedback sessions, PCPs (n = 5) identified flaws such as the term “high risk” of overdose potentially leading to unintended consequences (e.g., immediate addiction services referrals), offered suggestions, and expressed trust in the tool. In the first usability testing session, PCPs (n = 4) emphasized the need for natural risk presentation (e.g., 1 in 200) and suggested displaying the alert multiple times yearly for at-risk patients. Another 4 PCPs in the second usability testing session valued the UFHealth-specific alert for managing new or unfamiliar patients, expressed concerns about PCPs’ workload when prescribing to high-risk patients, and recommended incorporating the details page into training sessions to enhance usability. Conclusions: The final backend process for our CDS alert aligns with PCP needs and UFHealth standards. Integrating feedback from PCPs in the early development phase of our ML-driven CDS tool helped identify barriers and facilitators in the CDS integration process. This collaborative approach yielded a refined prototype aimed at minimizing unintended consequences and enhancing usability. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2024.

However, the current gesture design lacks norms and guidelines, and different people in different regions or backgrounds have different gesture cognition for the same function. Therefore, this paper puts forward usability evaluation index, introduces user participatory design method, combined with gesture recognition technology, and finally defines a group of car gestures with high usability and high user satisfaction. The study also emphasis that it is important to involve users in the design process. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Harmony is considered one of the most challenging and rigorous subjects in music education. This study focuses on the qualitative evaluation of HarmosphereVR, a virtual reality (VR) prototype designed to support the self-learning of harmony through immersive interactive exercises. The methodology included usability testing, reaction cards, and in-depth interviews to collect comprehensive feedback on the application’s effectiveness and user experience. The evaluation engaged six participants (four male and two female participants); half had previously participated in an exploratory interview to identify challenges and needs in learning harmony at music schools before the application was designed, while the rest of the participants were not acquainted with the project. The findings suggest that VR can serve as an auxiliary tool in music education, providing an engaging and effective platform for mastering complex theoretical concepts. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Action Research (AR) is about practitioners and academics interacting to generate knowledge. Using the University-Industry Collaboration (UIC) literature, we investigate the knowledge generation process through AR and whether this process can achieve the dual objective of practical relevance and theoretical novelty. Our study explores this through an examination of the utilisation of AR within UICs facilitated by the UK government’s Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) programme. Through an inductive, qualitative, multiple case study research design, we analysed three KTP projects, each lasting two years. We observed an evolution in the dynamics of the relationship between practitioners and academics, signifying a transition from mere knowledge transfer to a more participatory process of knowledge co-creation. We found that as the KTP project progresses through successive cycles of the AR spiral, there emerges a shift from single loop to double loop or multi loop learning, resulting in unplanned and emergent benefits and outcomes. This transition signifies a deeper exploration of underlying assumptions and strategies in AR projects, enabling the generation of novel knowledge. We offer a new framework by introducing the collaborative entanglement and linear knowledge enhancement arguments to explain the interaction patterns between researchers and practitioners in AR. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - This study aims to design an information system for searching for missing persons using a user-centered design (UCD) approach. This study used qualitative methods using interviews and quantitative methods by distributing the system usability scale (SUS) and post-study system usability questionnaire (PSSUQ) questionnaires. The respondents of this research consisted of official institutions, victims' families or relatives, volunteers, and experts in the field of interaction systems. The interviews were analyzed using the content analysis method, while the quantitative data were analyzed using the calculation method. The first iteration produced a low-fidelity prototype which was evaluated by interviews. The second iteration produced a high-fidelity prototype which was evaluated using usability testing (UT). The third iteration produced a high-fidelity prototype which was evaluated using SUS and PSSUQ. The SUS and PSSUQ values showed acceptable results. According to the authors' knowledge, there has been no research that proposes an information system for searching for missing persons in Indonesia with a comprehensive design process. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Working memory (WM) is a crucial cognitive function, and a deficit in this function is a critical factor in learning difficulties (LDs). As a result, there is growing interest in exploring different approaches to training WM to support students with LDs. Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, this systematic review aims to identify current computer-based WM training applications and their theoretical foundations, explore their effects on improving WM capacity and other cognitive/academic abilities, and extract design principles for creating an effective WM application for children with LDs. The 22 studies selected for this review provide strong evidence that children with LDs have low WM capacity and that their WM functions can be trained. The findings revealed four commercial WM training applications—COGMED, Jungle, BrainWare Safari, and N-back—that were utilized in 16 studies. However, these studies focused on suggesting different types of WM tasks and examining their effects rather than making those tasks user-friendly or providing practical guidelines for the end-user. To address this gap, the principles of the Human–Computer Interaction, with a focus on usability and user experience as well as relevant cognitive theories, and the design recommendations from the selected studies have been reviewed to extract a set of proposed guidelines. A total of 15 guidelines have been extracted that can be utilized to design WM training programs specifically for children with LDs. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The aim of the study was to examine the effects of rubric co-creation on peer feedback. From a social constructivist perspective, rubric co-creation might have the ability to promote the quality of feedback messages, interactivities within feedback processes, and uptake of feedback information in a peer-based collaborative setting of higher education. Two groups of English Language Studies majors (N = 57) from a Chinese university were recruited. In a writing class enacting peer feedback, the experimental group participated in the co-creation of rubrics whereas the control group accepted and used the co-created rubrics. Results showed that rubric co-creation had significantly positive effects on students’ use of criteria and the production of meaningful feedback messages instead of feedback writing styles. Regarding interaction patterns, the experimental group established active and bi-directional dialogic communication between peer learners. For uptake of feedback, the experimental group made significantly more critical application of feedback messages compared to the control group. The paper has implications for the enactment of rubric co-creation in peer-based learning and the promotion of learner agency in dialogic feedback interactions. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to investigate the usability of a public university website for measuring its efficiency, users’ satisfaction or anxiety while searching for and retrieving information through different devices. Design/methodology/approach: A task-based approach was adopted for the study. Twenty-eight participants were asked to complete 11 information-searching tasks on the website. The participants were divided into two groups. The tasks were carried out by members of each group, using desktop and mobile devices in a rotating fashion. Volunteers observed the participants' actions and recorded information regarding their productivity, time usage (using a timer), satisfaction or annoyance while performing each task. Finally, based on the use of the devices, a comparison was established between the participants' performance accuracy, efficiency and anxiety. Findings: The study provides an overview of a task-based user experience carried out on the university website using a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods. According to the results, participants' satisfaction levels were generally high, and their anxiety levels were low while completing the tasks on a mobile device. In comparison to the desktop, it took less time overall to complete all tasks. On the other hand, using a desktop computer (97.1%) resulted in better task completion success rates for participants than using a mobile device (85.7%). Originality/value: No previous task-based evaluation study of this kind has been conducted to assess the usability of any university website in Bangladesh. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Quadratic Surveys (QSs) elicit more accurate preferences than traditional methods like Likert-scale surveys. However, the cognitive load associated with QSs has hindered their adoption in digital surveys for collective decision-making. We introduce a two-phase "organize-then-vote"QS to reduce cognitive load. As interface design significantly impacts survey results and accuracy, our design scaffolds survey takers' decision-making while managing the cognitive load imposed by QS. In a 2x2 between-subject in-lab study on public resource allotment, we compared our interface with a traditional text interface across a QS with 6 (short) and 24 (long) options. Two-phase interface participants spent more time per option and exhibited shorter voting edit distances. We qualitatively observed shifts in cognitive effort from mechanical operations to constructing more comprehensive preferences. We conclude that this interface promoted deeper engagement, potentially reducing satisficing behaviors caused by cognitive overload in longer QSs. This research clarifies how human-centered design improves preference elicitation tools for collective decision-making. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Selective eating in children with autism spectrum disorder poses unique challenges due to sensory sensitivities, often leading to nutritional deficiencies and stress for families. Existing interventions are effective but resource-intensive and inaccessible due to clinics’ long waiting periods. This study uses participatory design principles, engaging parents in the co-creation of a sensory game-based platform. Through focus group and thematic analysis, key features were identified, including tools for tracking sensory behaviors, progress milestones, and personalized expert guidance. For children, parents prioritized gradual, structured sensory exposure, motivational rewards, and hybrid game-based environments blending digital and physical interactions. Open discussions highlighted the potential of a user-centered digital platform to complement therapies aligning with children’s evolving needs while supporting parents in managing mealtime challenges. The study culminates in a design brief proposing a home-based solution tailored to families’ needs. Future work involves refining, prototyping, and usability testing to ensure its practicality and effectiveness in real-world settings. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Background: Improving the quality of emergency nursing care requires enhancing triage competency through education programs that integrate the content of the Korean Triage and Acuity Scale, a triage system specifically developed for the Korean context. Thus, this study developed a competency-based triage education application (CTEA), based on the Korean Triage and Acuity Scale, and evaluated its effectiveness through usability testing. Method: The CTEA used various teaching methods and game mechanisms, including lectures, case studies, and video-based sce-narios, to improve triage competency. Results: In the usability testing phase, the CTEA was refined through expert heuristic evaluation and user interviews con-ducted with the think-aloud method. Six themes were derived from the interviews, highlighting the need for a well-structured program with realistic scenarios, easy accessibility, gamification, functional improvements, and future triage educational applications. Conclu-sion: These findings suggest that the CTEA is effective and satisfactory for users and can contribute to improving the triage competency of emergency nurses. © 2024, Slack Incorporated.

AB  - Robotic walking assistance devices support the rehabilitation of patients with neurological impairments. However, most commercialized systems rely on treadmill-based walking, which may not reflect real-world environments. This study aimed to evaluate the usability of a newly developed over-ground walking assistance robot (OWAR-MW) based on mecanum wheels compared with a commercial system (Andago) from the perspectives of physical therapists and patients with stroke. Nine physical therapists and nine stroke patients participated. Each participant walked 100 m using both the OWAR-MW and Andago systems. Subsequently, a satisfaction survey was conducted across three categories—safety, operability and functionality, and convenience—using a questionnaire adapted from the standard usability testing guidelines for walking assistive devices. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted to explore user experience and improvement needs. In both participant groups, the OWAR-MW showed a tendency for lower satisfaction scores than Andago across all categories. Stroke patients reported significantly lower scores in all three categories (safety: 4.90 vs. 4.04, operability and functionality: 4.83 vs. 4.33, convenience: 4.87 vs. 4.49, p < 0.05), whereas therapists noted a significant difference only in safety (4.02 vs. 3.37, p < 0.05). Key issues identified included a lack of handles, delay in actuator response, low motion detection sensitivity, non-intuitive controls, and discomfort caused by the harness, particularly the thigh straps. OWAR-MW demonstrated usability limitations in its current prototype form. Technical improvements in user interface, control accuracy, and harness design are necessary before clinical application. This study provides valuable feedback for the future development of user-centered rehabilitation robotics. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, are transforming how people approach complex creative and communicative tasks, including writing. While these tools are often seen as sources of inspiration and active contributors to the writing process, the question arises as to whether these perceptions vary across different writing contexts. In this study, we used two vignettes, each describing a fictional person experiencing emotional and cognitive challenges, to investigate how people interact with ChatGPT in two writing settings, which differed in their perspective of writing a counseling response (rational-analytical vs. emotional-supportive). Analyses of prompting behavior, content adoption from ChatGPT, time spent on the writing tasks, and ratings of own contribution to the text showed no significant interaction effects between perspective of writing and presented vignette and no main effects of perspective of writing. However, the analyses revealed significantly greater content adoption and more time spent on the second than on the first vignette. Linguistic feature analysis of the texts revealed a significantly greater average text length and a greater usage of affect-based (both only for the second vignette) and informal (across both vignettes) wording in the emotional-supportive than in the rational-analytical writing condition. In addition, there was a greater frequency of analytical wording in the rational-analytical than in the emotional-supportive writing condition across both vignettes. This study contributes to the field of human-AI co-creation by providing insights into interaction patterns of human-AI co-writing, with our results suggesting a similar approach to the use of AI for rational-analytical and emotional-supportive writing contexts. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to develop a conceptual model, ProvKOS, for tracking the provenance of change activities in a knowledge organization system (KOS). By extending current provenance practices, this model represents dynamic changes in a KOS more effectively. Design/methodology/approach: We take a five-step approach to develop the conceptual model, including content analysis of KOS editorial data, environmental scan of existing provenance models, development of persona-specific provenance questions and a participatory design with stakeholders to ensure the model’s utility. Findings: We introduce (1) a taxonomy of editorial activities for a KOS; (2) a conceptual model ProvKOS, which extends existing models PROV and Simple Knowledge Organization Systems (SKOS). We also provide detailed data dictionaries for the entities, activities and warrants classes proposed in the model. A use case on “gender dysphoria” in Dewey Decimal Classifications (DDCs) is provided to illustrate the implementation of ProvKOS. This shows ProvKOS’s ability to capture KOS changes effectively and to link external resources relating to the changes. Research limitations/implications: Further validation may be needed to implement the ProvKOS model across various types of KOSs. Practical implications: ProvKOS can help improve machine readability, querying and analysis of a KOS. Especially within the linked data environment, the enhanced provenance documentation through ProvKOS can enable a network of KOSs, which will then inform better linked data or knowledge graph designs. Social implications: By facilitating better tracking of changes within a KOS and across KOSs, ProvKOS can enhance the accessibility and usability of knowledge bases across different cultural and social contexts, thus better supporting inclusive information practices. Originality/value: The proposed model is novel in two ways: one, its ability to represent dynamic change activities in a KOS, which has not been discussed anywhere else; two, it supports the interconnectivity across KOSs by providing a “warrant” class to substantiate the context of changes. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: It has been estimated that more than one-third of university students suffer from insomnia. Few accessible eHealth sleep education programmes exist for university students and of the ones that do exist, fewer were developed using a user-centred approach, which allows for student input to be systematically collected and utilized to provide students with a programme that they consider to be easy to use and implement and to be effective. Better Nights, Better Days-Youth (BNBD-Youth) is a four-session eHealth sleep education programme designed for youth but previously only evaluated in younger adolescents (ages 14–18 years). Aims: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usability of the BNBD-Youth programme with university students using Morville's User Experience Honeycomb framework to determine if this programme would meet the needs of university students and if so what modifications would be needed. Methods: Canadian undergraduate students (n = 46) completed the BNBD-Youth programme. Students completed online usability questionnaires based on the seven dimensions of Morville's User Experience Honeycomb (i.e. useful, usable, valuable, credible, desirable, accessible and findable) after each session and after completion of the programme. Open- and closed-ended questions were used to obtain both quantitative and qualitative responses. Results: Average quantitative ratings were positive across user experience dimensions, ranging from 3.43 to 4.46 (out of 5). Qualitative responses indicated overall positive experiences with the programme. The only constructive feedback that met the criteria for revising the programme was to include more interactive features in Session 4. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that university students found BNBD-Youth to be a usable programme for older youth. Demonstrating usability is an essential step in developing a programme with a user-centred design that university students will want to use in the future. Once the BNBD-Youth programme is revised to create the BNBD-University (BNBD-Uni) programme, additional usability and effectiveness testing will be conducted. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Research shows that drivers rarely consult the vehicle owner’s manual to learn to operate advanced safety features, like Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). Students from a United States university participated in a national competition, called EcoCAR Mobility Challenge (sponsored by the Department of Energy), to develop an engaging solution that is efficient and effective in educating drivers about the operation of ACC while adhering to user-centered design methodology. Students used an iterative design process and collected quantitative and qualitative data to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of a mobile application. Iterations of the prototype included an interactive guide, video components, remote connection to the vehicle, and ultimately a solution that could reside on the vehicle’s infotainment system. This paper details the process and evaluation outcomes and serves as a model for user-centered design of tutorials for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The Chinese government has developed a unique “Smart Eldercare” model that utilizes digital technologies to address the growing needs of its rapidly aging population. To implement this model, the government has initiated policies to accelerate talent cultivation, highlighting the importance of Smart Eldercare education at different levels in universities and vocational schools. This paper presents the design and development of an aging scenario Wiki and conducts a usability evaluation of this Wiki as a collaborative learning tool for nascent Smart Eldercare education. First, during the development phase, we conducted lab-based usability testing using 18 tasks of 3 types with 12 student participants who followed the think-aloud protocol. Our analysis identified seven usability issues, and we subsequently addressed them in the optimization phase. Second, we evaluated the usability of the aging scenario Wiki as a learning tool in actual work teaching activities involving 54 students who collaborated on creating aging scenarios. The evaluation yields a System Usability Scale score of 67.45 and a C usability rating, indicating the areas for further improvement. Overall, the aging scenario Wiki demonstrated the potential to be a practical and effective learning tool for nascent Smart Eldercare education. Our study highlights the importance of user-centered design and usability testing in developing educational resources for emerging fields such as Smart Eldercare. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - Background: The evidence base supports effectiveness of dental sealants for prevention of childhood caries in school-aged children. Objective: This study describes planning, development, usability testing and outcomes following implementation of DentaSeal, a web-based application designed to accurately track unique student data and generate reports for all Wisconsin school-based sealant placement (SP) programs. Methods: Application software development was informed by a steering committee of representative stakeholders who were interviewed to inform design and provide feedback for design of DentaSeal during development and evaluation. Software development proceeded based on wireframes developed to build architectural design. Usability testing followed and informed any required adjustments to the application. The DentaSeal prototype was beta tested and fully implemented subsequently in the public health sector. Results: The DentaSeal application demonstrated capacity to: 1) track unique student SP data and longitudinal encounter history, 2) generate reports and 3) support administrative tracking. In 2019, DentaSeal captured SP data of 47 school-based programs in Wisconsin that sponsored > 7,000 program visits for 184,000 children from 62 counties. Delivery of > 548,000 SP services were catalogued. Conclusions: For public health initiatives targeting reduction in caries incidence, web-based applications such as DentaSeal represent useful longitudinal tracking tools for cataloguing SP in school-based program participants.  © 2023 - IOS Press.

AB  - To engage users, healthcare interfaces should reflect gender-specific demands and preferences. The goal is to compare male and female healthcare platform users' interaction time, job completion rate, mistake rate, and feature preferences. These disparities should be addressed to create interfaces that improve patient engagement and make platforms intuitive, helpful, and beneficial for both men and women. Healthcare providers may enhance patient outcomes, user happiness, and health management engagement by customizing interface elements to gender-specific expectations. User-centered interfaces that meet varied user demands are created by examining interaction patterns and preferences. This gender-sensitive strategy optimizes healthcare interaction for more personalized and effective patient care. For five interaction categories, male and female values average 4.7-6, according to User Interaction Metrics in Healthcare.5. Men and women complete tasks at 7 9 - 9 2 percent. Error Male and female percent rates vary from 1-6, while satisfaction scores range from 7.4-8 out of 10.7. Male and female are used 5.5-7 times in Healthcare Interface Feature Preferences.9. Male and female feature relevance is 7. 2 - 9. 1. Male and female Ease of Use values are 6.9-8. The user satisfaction range for male and female values is 7. 5 - 8. 9. Male and female frequency requests are 2-4.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Background Falls are a widespread and persistent problem for community-dwelling older adults. Use of fall prevention guidelines in the primary care setting has been suboptimal. Interoperable computerized clinical decision support systems have the potential to increase engagement with fall risk management at scale. To support fall risk management across organizations, our team developed the ASPIRE tool for use in differing primary care clinics using interoperable standards. Objectives Usability testing of ASPIRE was conducted to measure ease of access, overall usability, learnability, and acceptability prior to pilot. Methods Participants were recruited using purposive sampling from two sites with different electronic health records and different clinical organizations. Formative testing rooted in user-centered design was followed by summative testing using a simulation approach. During summative testing participants used ASPIRE across two clinical scenarios and were randomized to determine which scenario they saw first. Single Ease Question and System Usability Scale were used in addition to analysis of recorded sessions in NVivo. Results All 14 participants rated the usability of ASPIRE as above average based on usability benchmarks for the System Usability Scale metric. Time on task decreased significantly between the first and second scenarios indicating good learnability. However, acceptability data were more mixed with some recommendations being consistently accepted while others were adopted less frequently. Conclusion This study described the usability testing of the ASPIRE system within two different organizations using different electronic health records. Overall, the system was rated well, and further pilot testing should be done to validate that these positive results translate into clinical practice. Due to its interoperable design, ASPIRE could be integrated into diverse organizations allowing a tailored implementation without the need to build a new system for each organization. This distinction makes ASPIRE well positioned to impact the challenge of falls at scale. © 2023. Thieme. All rights reserved.

AB  - The increasing digitalization and automatization in the manufacturing industry as well as the need to learn on the job has reinforced the need for much more granular learning, which has not yet impacted the design of learning materials. In this regard, granular learning concepts require situated learning materials to support self-directed learning in the workplace in a targeted manner. Co-creation approaches offer promising opportunities to support employees in the independent design of such situated learning materials. Using an action-design research (ADR) approach, we derived requirements from co-creation concepts and practice by conducting focus group workshops in manufacturing and vocational training schools to develop design principles for a co-creation system that supports employees through the creation process of work-process-related learning material. Consequently, we formulate four design principles for the design of a collaborative learning and qualification system for manufacturing. Using an innovative mixed methods approach, we validate these design principles and design features to demonstrate the success of the developed artifact. The results provide insights regarding the design of a co-creation system to support learners in the co-creation of learning material with the consideration of cognitive load (CL). Our study contributes to research and practice by proposing novel design principles for supporting employees in peer creation processes. Furthermore, our study reveals how co-creation systems can support the collaborative development of learning materials in the work process. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Digital transformation accelerates the undertaking of online learning at various levels of education. Online learning mandates students to have high self-regulation skills. Therefore, self-regulated learning (SRL) plays an important role in the education field. The third wave of SRL measurements suggests how measurement is applied concurrently with the intervention. This study proposes a learning diary that we call Diaria to take part in the third wave. Diaria was developed using a user-centred design with three phases: design research, design prototype, and design evaluation. Usability testing was selected as an evaluation design method involving 30 participants. The evaluation results were examined based on several categories, including distribution of the System Usability Scale score, issues, task performance, and potential solution. An initial investigation of the impact of learning diaries on students’ SRL skills was carried out as a pilot study. This experiment involved 24 participants in a linear algebra course. The interview method was applied to collect data, followed by a thematic content analysis to understand the resulting transcripts. The results showed that the prototype has good usability. In addition, recommendations for improvement are suggested. Further, the pilot study has shown that there are various student learning strategies and advantages to a learning diary and has provided valuable notes for the main study © 2023, International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning.All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Objectives: Technology, mobile health (mHealth), and “eHealth” are broadly used in childhood overweight and obesity interventions. However, the impact of technology-based interventions where parents or caregivers are involved is unclear. Thus, the objective of this manuscript is to provide valuable insights about the development of a parent–child web-based tool to promote healthy eating among preadolescents. Methods: The tool development was an iterative process and comprised of two phases. In Phase 1, formative research (focus groups and interviews) were conducted with parents of children around the topics of dietary behaviors, technology use, and proposed intervention components. In Phase 2, a brief survey, focus groups, interviews, and user-centered approaches were used to confirm/finalize content, assess the website wireframe, and conduct usability testing. Results: From the Phase 1 formative research, parents preferred reading/looking up health-related information on larger laptop/tablet screens, but preferred smartphones when reading “on-the-go.” Suggestions for an online health tool included quick/easy/low-cost recipes, tips for healthy feeding and involving their children around healthy dietary-related behaviors, clear tool navigation, and using pictures/visuals. In Phase 2, when finalizing the tool wireframe and content, parents preferred a variety of motivational healthy feeding tips, local family-oriented community events, and a simple layout with minimal clicking to access links. During usability testing, parents responded positively to the content (healthy feeding tips, recipes, coupons, and free community events) and the clean layout. Conclusions: Formative research and user-centered approaches with parents of preadolescents resulted in a web-based, mobile-friendly health promotion tool. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - GKJ Dayu is a church located in Sleman, Yogyakarta, with approximately 500 congregation members. The church lacks a dedicated system for recording and displaying information regarding the congregation's development. This has posed challenges for church administrators in obtaining insights into the congregation's conditions and mapping. A dashboard system was developed using the User-Centered Design methodology to address this issue. Testing was conducted by applying usability tests and the USE Questionnaire. The research involved twelve respondents ranging in age from 25 to 41 years.

AB  - Polariscope is an R&D project resulting from a consortium between the academia and a municipal historical archive. The project is focused on developing a participatory digital experience of cultural archives and events from multiple perspectives using collaborative storytelling to share, visualize and co-create collective memories. Designed as an online community that gathers contributions from citizens and institutions, the platform intends to promote rich digital experiences through interactive and narrative visualizations around meaningful cultural events and heritage data, presenting multimedia visualizations built from archives and testimonies shared by people. The methodological approach of the project adopts a User-Centered Design (UCD) iterative process comprising four phases: 1) Literature review and related work; 2) User research and functional requirements specification; 3) Laboratory evaluation of a medium-fidelity prototype with users; 4) Pilot case studies in field trials related to cultural events. This paper is focused on presenting phases 1 and 2, which are dedicated to the definition and ideation of the digital experience proposed by the platform, validated by an empirical study using focus groups with experts. In overall, the results allowed the validation of the functional requirements, and the identification of the expected features and interaction patterns related to the processes of content contribution, validation, discovery, and curation to include in the next iteration of the prototype to be tested with users. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Objectives Clinical decision support (CDS) has promise for the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) in the emergency department (ED). We sought to assess the usability of a newly developed automated CDS to improve guideline-adherent antibiotic prescribing for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and urinary tract infection (UTI). Methods We conducted comparative usability testing between an automated, prototype CDS-enhanced discharge order set and standard order set, for pediatric CAP and UTI antibiotic prescribing. After an extensive user-centered design process, the prototype CDS was integrated into the electronic health record, used passive activation, and embedded locally adapted prescribing guidelines. Participants were randomized to interact with three simulated ED scenarios of children with CAP or UTI, across both systems. Measures included task completion, decision-making and usability errors, clinical actions (order set use and correct antibiotic selection), as well as objective measures of system usability, utility, and workload using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). The prototype CDS was iteratively refined to optimize usability and workflow. Results Usability testing in 21 ED clinical providers demonstrated that, compared to the standard order sets, providers preferred the prototype CDS, with improvements in domains such as explanations of suggested antibiotic choices (p < 0.001) and provision of additional resources on antibiotic prescription (p < 0.001). Simulated use of the CDS also led to overall improved guideline-adherent prescribing, with a 31% improvement for CAP. A trend was present toward absolute workload reduction. Using the NASA-TLX, workload scores for the current system were median 26, interquartile ranges (IQR): 11 to 41 versus median 25, and IQR: 10.5 to 39.5 for the CDS system (p = 0.117). Conclusion Our CDS-enhanced discharge order set for ED antibiotic prescribing was strongly preferred by users, improved the accuracy of antibiotic prescribing, and trended toward reduced provider workload. The CDS was optimized for impact on guideline-adherent antibiotic prescribing from the ED and end-user acceptability to support future evaluative trials of ED ASPs. © 2023 Georg Thieme Verlag.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) has been widely applied as a promising technology for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, most studies in the literature have been conducted by researchers who are not disabled or autistic, resulting in products that are less user-centered. To address this issue, Project PHoENIX is initiated to gather information from stakeholders, including autistic people, caregivers, and parents, about their needs and preferences when using VR. Throughout the development cycle, a variety of user-centered learning experience design methods and process were employed. To assess the usability and user experience of Project PHoENIX, a formative evaluation with multiple usability sessions was conducted across two phases: Phase I Usability Testing and Phase II Pilot Testing. In this paper, we present the co-design process of Project PHoENIX with autistic stakeholders, followed by the results of a formative evaluation on the VR environments in Project PHoENIX. Multiple usability evaluation methods were utilized in both phases. The quantitative and qualitative findings suggest that utilizing co-design and user experience design methods, Project PHoENIX was designed using an innovative approach and is perceived as a highly usable, relevant, and satisfying VR technology, with the potential to scale to serve a broader community of individuals with autism. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Geological folds are complex wave-like 3D deformation structures. The identification and measurement of characteristic geometric elements of folds (e.g., wavelength, amplitude, orientation of fold axis and fold axial plane) in rocks constitute core skills of field-based Earth scientists and prove to be challenging teaching topics for novice undergraduate geologists. This paper presents an immersive, interactive VR tool for visualising geological folds for educational purposes. We describe a novel geological folding visualisation system, designed to scaffold students in learning this complex spatial concept. Through a user-centered design with geologists, a new tool for digitally visualising geological folds for low financial and computational cost was developed. We describe its major components and visualisation approach, along with its interaction approach for providing fold visualisations. We further report findings from a usability testing (N=11) and report future design considerations. © 2022 ACM.

AB  - The study examines the cumulative impact of factors that affect usability testing for user-centered web design, namely the so-called ‘contextual fidelity model’ factors that include product properties, task features, user traits, and environment/context factors. Today, the design, user experience and usability (DUXU) research experiences a lack of studies that would assess combinatorial, rather than individual, effects of these factors upon user performance. We address this gap by seeing both independent factors and the resulting user states as complex and dynamic, and testing the combined impact of aesthetic quality of websites, user traits, and individual/group experiment settings upon formation of two dysfunctional user states that critically affect user performance, namely monotony and anxiety. We develop a research design that allows for assessing the combinatorial effects in formation of user dysfunctionality. For that, we conduct a study with 80 assessors of Russian/European and Chinese origin in individual/group setting, employing two types of tasks and websites of high/low aesthetic quality. As the results of our experiment show, group task solving enhances the synchronous impact of website aesthetics and task features upon user states. Interaction of high-quality design, group environment, and monotonous tasks provides for an antagonistic effect when aesthetic layout in a group environment significantly reduces the fatigue rate. Low aesthetic quality in a group environment leads to cumulative enhancing of dysfunctionality for both monotony and anxiety. We conclude by setting questions and prospects for further research. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Research into Artificial Placenta and Artificial Womb (APAW) technology for extremely premature infants (born < 28 weeks of gestation) is currently being conducted in animal studies and shows promising results. Because of the unprecedented nature of a potential treatment and the high-risk and low incidence of occurrence, translation to the human condition is a complex task. Consequently, the obstetric procedure, the act of transferring the infant from the pregnant woman to the APAW system, has not yet been established for human patients. The use of simulation-based user-centered development allows for a safe environment in which protocols and devices can be conceptualized and tested. Our aim is to use participatory design principles in a simulation context, to gain and integrate the user perspectives in the early design phase of a protocol for this novel procedure. Methods: Simulation protocols and prototypes were developed using an iterative participatory design approach; usability testing, including general and task-specific feedback, was obtained from participants with clinical expertise from a range of disciplines. The procedure made use of fetal and maternal manikins and included animations and protocol task cards. Results: Physical simulation with the active participation of clinicians led to the diffusion of tacit knowledge and an iteratively formed shared understanding of the requirements and values that needed to be implemented in the procedure. At each sequel, participant input was translated into simulation protocols and design adjustments. Conclusion: This work demonstrates that simulation-based participatory design can aid in shaping the future of clinical procedure and product development and rehearsing future implementation with healthcare professionals. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Computationally creative systems for music have recently achieved impressive results, fuelled by progress in generative machine learning. However, black-box approaches have raised fundamental concerns for ethics, accountability, explainability, and musical plausibility. To enable trustworthy machine creativity, we introduce the Harmonic Memory, a Knowledge Graph (KG) of harmonic patterns extracted from a large and heterogeneous musical corpus. By leveraging a cognitive model of tonal harmony, chord progressions are segmented into meaningful structures, and patterns emerge from their comparison via harmonic similarity. Akin to a music memory, the KG holds temporal connections between consecutive patterns, as well as salient similarity relationships. After demonstrating the validity of our choices, we provide examples of how this design enables novel pathways for combinational creativity. The memory provides a fully accountable and explainable framework to inspire and support creative professionals - allowing for the discovery of progressions consistent with given criteria, the recomposition of harmonic sections, but also the co-creation of new progressions. © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - Purpose: To verify the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in the usability test of the tinnitus assessment application. Methods: This is a descriptive usability test study that assessed the satisfaction, effectiveness, and efficiency of the application. The test was carried out virtually via Google Forms. First, the participants received instructions on how to access and use Avazum, through texts and illustrative images. Afterward, the users used the application, observing its functions and usability. Next, the participants answered the usability questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 21.0, to perform descriptive analysis such as frequency, percentages of data in the System Usability Questionnaire (SUS), and analysis in the Net Promoter Score (NPS). Results: Thus, the overall mean SUS score was consistent with satisfactory usability, which implies that the application does not present serious usability problems. Also, the overall NPS percentage indicated very good user satisfaction, with a good percentage of promoting users. As far as effectiveness is concerned, it was found that Avazum reached its goals, besides being efficient, as it uses clear language and is comfortably used. Conclusion: Avazum obtained very good satisfaction from users, in addition to achieving its goals. It proved to be effective, has clear language, and is comfortably used, adducing efficiency in the multidisciplinary evaluation of tinnitus. © Este é um artigo publicado em acesso aberto (Open Access) sob a liceEste é um artigo publicado em acesso aberto (Open Access) sob a licença Creative Commons Attribution, que permite uso, distribuição e reprodução em qualquer meio, sem restrições desde que o trabalho original seja corretamente citado.nça Creative Commons Attribution, que permite uso, distribuição e reprodução em qualquer meio, sem restrições desde que o trabalho original seja corretamente citado.

AB  - User experience is one of the key aspects nowadays in any successful web-based or Mobile based application. Usability is a measure of a software application or product that is calculated based on its users and it defines the easiness, efficiency of the application usage with user satisfaction. Look & feel and the navigation defines the usability of the application. The complex workflow or user actions can be made simple with the thoughtful User interface. A systematic study and strategy defined for the usability aspects will take the application usage to the next level. There are various proven frameworks available for improving usability. HCD framework, also known as Human Centered Design, is one of the impactful frameworks which focuses on understanding the end user for their needs, constraints, and behaviors. Design Thinking is another framework that helps in designing user-centric applications in a way that is intuitive and natural. This paper is focusing on defining the process for usability measurement. A complete framework for the usability parameter definition and its measurement at various levels of the application development phase is explained in detail in this paper. There is a wider literature review done for the proposed strategy, the details will be provided along with a comparative study. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2024.

AB  - Participatory design includes stakeholders in the development of products intended to solve real-life challenges. Involving end users in the design of robots is vital for developing effective, useful, acceptable and user-friendly products that meet expectations, needs, and preferences. This four-year international project developed and evaluated a home-based robot for mood stabilization and cognitive improvement in older adults with mild cognitive impairment and age-related health needs. The daily-care robot was developed in collaboration with experts, carers, relatives, and older adults, through six phases. Two phases were dedicated to cognitive stimulation games. This paper provides a summary of the participatory design and mixed-methods evaluation processes undertaken to develop, refine, and test the robot. The final robot and games were acceptable to older adults, and useful for delivering stimulating activities and providing reminders for medication, health and wellbeing checks. Personalization is required to optimize human-robot interaction, and imagery and speech should be consistent with local users. Functions should be personalizable to accommodate individual health needs and preferences. This project highlights the importance of participatory design and testing robotics in end-user environments, as technical issues associated with long-term use were uncovered. Recommendations for future development and the design of assistive health robots are made. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.

AB  - We report on a series of four studies that investigated how user experience design (UXD) can improve printed educational materials (PEMs). We examined the perceived usability of an existing PEM for breast cancer screening and observed the usability problems associated with it (Study 1). We then compared a breast cancer screening PEM created by user experience designers with two other breast cancer screening PEMS, finding that the PEM based on UXD had higher perceived usability, and lower mentions of usability problems, than the other two PEMs (Study 2). We next examined the impact of individual differences in design expertise on perceived usability, this time including a PEM on cervical cancer screening as well as one on breast cancer screening (Study 3). Our concluding study (Study 4) then examined the impacts of UXD on learnability of PEM content as defined by answers to a knowledge questionnaire about screening administered before and after reading the PEM, and by intention to screen for cancer after reading the PEM. The first three studies showed that the involvement of UXD improved the perceived usability of PEMs, and Study 3 showed that designers differ in their ability to create useable PEMs. Study 4 failed to find a corresponding improvement in learnability or intention to screen when UXD was used to improve perceived usability. We conclude that a user experience design approach that incorporates graphic design can improve the perceived usability of PEMs in some situations (e.g., when the PEM material is not too lengthy or complex, and when the graphic designer is sufficiently skilled). However, we found no evidence that lack of perceived usability accounted for the failure of PEMS (found in previous research) to improve knowledge or intention to screen. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The rapid advancement of technology has had a profound impact on human life, driving the need for faster and more effective social activities, including donation practices. One notable example of technological progress is the emergence of social crowdfunding platforms, which have revolutionized the way donations are made. However, the integration of in-kind donation features, specifically donating goods, remains relatively limited on crowdfunding platforms, as they predominantly focus on managing monetary contributions. Nonetheless, there are segments of the population who require the donation of goods due to difficulties in managing unused items and a preference for ensuring that donated items serve their intended purpose. This background necessitates the development of an interaction design for incorporating the donation of goods on crowdfunding platforms. The primary objective of this research is to explore and identify the challenges and design considerations related to digital donation features for goods. Employing a user-centered design approach, based on the ISO 9241-210:2019 method, the study follows a four-stage development process that prioritizes user needs and preferences. The culmination of this research effort is a high-fidelity interactive prototype that achieves usability goals related to effectiveness and utility, as well as user experience goals associated with helpfulness and enjoyment. The evaluation of the prototype's effectiveness and user experience employs usability testing methods, including interviews, Single Ease Question (SEQ) surveys, and the System Usability Scale (SUS). The results of the second iteration of testing indicate that the constructed interaction design successfully addresses the predefined usability and user experience goals. Moreover, this phase of testing generates valuable insights that can inform future design recommendations. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Remote testing has been exploited in software development for several years. Until recently, virtual support in the design of physical tools and appliances has received much less attention. The years of pandemic travel restriction have created a completely novel set of requirements for usability testing, whereby the physical interaction between the experimenter and the end user has been no longer possible. In this frame, the host of new communication platforms that became available provided means for innovative protocols of remote synchronous interaction. Here, we successfully apply them for the testing of medical devices in the user-centered design development. The proposed protocol is validated along the development of a medical applicator tool, the SYMPLX, designed for the use in the operating room by cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons (the end users). The applicator is aimed at facilitating the combination of a protective pouch made of biosynthesized cellulose, the Hylomate, and a target pacemaker or defibrillator upon their implantation in cardiovascular patients. The testing with end user rendered a number of videos featuring a reproduced model of the operating room, where the clinical procedure was performed with the use of SYMPLX. The ensuing analysis extracted four quantitative descriptors of the performance, with sufficient reliability and reproducibility to evaluate design improvements, as well as user-related variability and learning process. Altogether, we describe and validate a new flexible and cost-effective protocol that can support the remote design of medical devices and has the potential to be optimized for other physical tools. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Augmented Reality (AR) has great potential to facilitate multisensorial and experiential learning. However, creating activities in AR for everyday classroom use is far from an easy task for non-experts users, such as teachers and learners. To examine if and how an authoring approach for AR can be beneficial for educational contexts, we first designed MIXAP through a participatory design with 19 pilot teachers. MIXAP enables non-expert users to create AR activities using interactive and visual authoring workflows. To evaluate our approach with a wider audience of teachers, we conducted a study with 39 teachers examining the usability, utility, acceptability, and transfer between pilot and non-pilot teachers. We found that this approach can help teachers create quality educational AR activities. For both groups, the effect sizes were significantly large for ease of use, emotional experience, and low cognitive load. Additionally, we found that there is no significant difference between the pilot and non-pilot teachers in terms of ease of use, learnability, emotional experience, and cognitive load, highlighting the transfer of our approach to a wider audience. Ultimately, we discuss our results and propose perspectives. Copyright © 2023 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - Objective: This scoping review aimed to identify the design and usability testing of a telerehabilitation (TR) system, and its characteristics and functionalities that are best-suited for rehabilitating adults with chronic diseases. Methods: Searches were conducted in PubMed, EBSCO, Web of Science, and Cochrane library for studies published between January 2017 and December 2022. We followed the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines and the framework by Arksey and O’Malley. Screening was undertaken by two reviewers, and data extraction was undertaken by the first author. Then, the data were further reviewed and discussed thoroughly with the team members. Results: A total of 31 results were identified, with the core criteria of developing and testing a telerehabilitation system, including a mobile app for cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory disorders. All developed systems resulted from multidisciplinary teams and employed mixed-methods research. We proposed the “input-process-output” framework that identified phases of both system design and usability testing. Through system design, we reported the use of user-centered design, iterative design, users’ needs and characteristics, theory underpinning development, and the expert panel in 64%, 75%, 86%, 82%, and 71% of the studies, respectively. We recorded the application of moderated usability testing, unmoderated testing (1), and unmoderated testing (2) in 74%, 63%, and 15% of the studies, respectively. The identified design and testing activities produced a matured system, a high-fidelity prototype, and a released system in 81.5%, 15%, and 3.5%, respectively. Conclusion: This review provides a framework for TR system design and testing for a wide range of chronic diseases that require prolonged management through remote monitoring using a mobile app. The identified “input-process-output” framework highlights the inputs, design, development, and improvement as components of the system design. It also identifies the “moderated-unmoderated” model for conducting usability testing. This review illustrates characteristics and functionalities of the TR systems and healthcare professional roles. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Background: Homebound older adults are a high-risk group for depression. However, many of them face barriers to accessing evidence-supported mental health treatments. Digital mental health interventions can potentially improve treatment access, but few web-based interventions are explicitly tailored for depression in older adults. Objective: This paper describes the development process of Empower@Home, a web-delivered intervention for depression in homebound older adults that is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, and reports on the outcomes of usability studies. Methods: Empower@Home was developed in collaboration with community agencies, stakeholders, and older adults, guided by user-centered design principles. User needs were assessed through secondary data analysis, demographic and health profiles from administrative data, and interviews and surveys of community partners. A comparative usability evaluation was conducted with 10 older adults to assess the usability of Empower@Home compared to 2 similar programs. Field testing was conducted with 4 end users to detect additional usability issues. Results: Feedback and recommendations from community partners heavily influenced the content and design of Empower@Home. The intervention consists of 9 sessions, including psychoeducation and an introduction to cognitive behavioral therapy skills and tools through short video clips, in-session exercises, an animated storyline, and weekly out-of-session home practice. A printed workbook accompanies the web-based lessons. In comparative usability testing (N=10), Empower@Home received a System Usability Scale score of 78 (SD 7.4), which was significantly higher than the 2 comparator programs (t9=3.28; P=.005 and t9=2.78; P=.011). Most participants, 80% (n=8), preferred Empower@Home over the comparators. In the longitudinal field test (n=4), all participants reported liking the program procedures and feeling confident in performing program-related tasks. The single-subject line graph showed an overall downward trend in their depression scores over time, offering an encouraging indication of the intervention’s potential effects. Conclusions: Collaboration with community stakeholders and careful consideration of potential implementation issues during the design process can result in more usable, engaging, and effective digital mental health interventions. ©Xiaoling Xiang, Jay Kayser, Samson Ash, Chuxuan Zheng, Yihang Sun, Addie Weaver, Ruth Dunkle, James A Blackburn, Alex Halavanau, Jia Xue, Joseph A Himle.

AB  - Background: Postfracture acute pain is often inadequately managed in older adults. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies can offer opportunities for self-management of pain; however, insufficient apps exist for acute pain management after a fracture, and none are designed for an older adult population. Objective: This study aims to design, develop, and evaluate an mHealth app prototype using a human-centered design approach to support older adults in the self-management of postfracture acute pain. Methods: This study used a multidisciplinary and user-centered design approach. Overall, 7 stakeholders (ie, 1 clinician-researcher specialized in internal medicine, 2 user experience designers, 1 computer science researcher, 1 clinical research assistant researcher, and 2 pharmacists) from the project team, together with 355 external stakeholders, were involved throughout our user-centered development process that included surveys, requirement elicitation, participatory design workshops, mobile app design and development, mobile app content development, and usability testing. We completed this study in 3 phases. We analyzed data from prior surveys administered to 305 members of the Canadian Osteoporosis Patient Network and 34 health care professionals to identify requirements for designing a low-fidelity prototype. Next, we facilitated 4 participatory design workshops with 6 participants for feedback on content, presentation, and interaction with our proposed low-fidelity prototype. After analyzing the collected data using thematic analysis, we designed a medium-fidelity prototype. Finally, to evaluate our medium-fidelity prototype, we conducted usability tests with 10 participants. The results informed the design of our high-fidelity prototype. Throughout all the phases of this development study, we incorporated inputs from health professionals to ensure the accuracy and validity of the medical content in our prototypes. Results: We identified 3 categories of functionalities necessary to include in the design of our initial low-fidelity prototype: the need for support resources, diary entries, and access to educational materials. We then conducted a thematic analysis of the data collected in the design workshops, which revealed 4 themes: feedback on the user interface design and usability, requests for additional functionalities, feedback on medical guides and educational materials, and suggestions for additional medical content. On the basis of these results, we designed a medium-fidelity prototype. All the participants in the usability evaluation tests found the medium-fidelity prototype useful and easy to use. On the basis of the feedback and difficulties experienced by participants, we adjusted our design in preparation for the high-fidelity prototype. Conclusions: We designed, developed, and evaluated an mHealth app to support older adults in the self-management of pain after a fracture. The participants found our proposed prototype useful for managing acute pain and easy to interact with and navigate. Assessment of the clinical outcomes and long-term effects of our proposed mHealth app will be evaluated in the future. ©Kevin Tran-Nguyen, Caroline Berger, Roxanne Bennett, Michelle Wall, Suzanne N Morin, Fateme Rajabiyazdi.

AB  - Background: Falls in older adults are a serious public health problem that can lead to reduced quality of life or death. Patients often do not receive fall prevention guidance from primary care providers, despite evidence that falls can be prevented. Mobile health technologies may help to address this disparity and promote evidence-based fall prevention. Objective: Our main objective was to use Human-Centered Design (HCD) to develop a user-friendly, fall prevention exercise app using validated user requirements. The app features evidence-based behavior change strategies and exercise content to support older people initiating and adhering to a progressive fall prevention exercise program. Methods: We organized our multi-stage, iterative design process into three phases: Gathering User Requirements, Usability Evaluation, and Refining App Features. Our methods include focus groups, usability testing, and subject matter expert meetings. Results: Focus groups (Total n=6), usability testing (n=30) including a post-Test questionnaire [Health-ITUES score: mean (SD)= 4.2 (1.1)], and subject matter expert meetings demonstrate participant satisfaction with the app concept and design. Overall, participants saw value in receiving exercise prescriptions from the app that would be recommended by their PCP and reported satisfaction with the content of the app, but several participants felt that they were not the right user for the app. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the development, refinement and usability testing of a fall prevention exercise app and corresponding tools that primary care providers may use to prescribe tailored exercise recommendations to their older patients as an evidence-based fall prevention strategy accessible in the context of busy clinical workflows. © 2023 Georg Thieme Verlag.

AB  - European Union (EU) policies often state that public services must focus on users' needs. However, cross-border services in the EU are still not widely user-centred. One reason is that the development of these services may not have involved sufficient user research and testing in identifying and addressing users' needs and pain points. Additionally, different government agencies or organisations may develop their own processes for service implementation, resulting in a lack of coordination and integration in the user experience. Furthermore, cross- border digital services may have been designed to comply with legal and regulatory requirements rather than to meet users' needs, leading to a focus on compliance rather than user experience. Another reason could be that different countries have different languages, cultures, and work methods. Therefore, it could be challenging to design a user-centred one-size-fits-all service for all EU citizens, as it depends on the specific service and how it is designed and implemented. Nevertheless, the EU is actively promoting user-centred design and digitalisation of public services, with an emphasis on user-centricity, so it can be expected that more EU cross-border services will be designed with user needs in mind. This research aims to explore the potential of adopting a user journey approach for improving cross- border mobility through the design and implementation of cross-border digital public services. This study examines the current state of cross-border mobility regarding the challenges individuals face when working or studying abroad and the role of technology in facilitating mobility. The user journey approach is used to identify and prioritise citizens' essential needs and pain points in the cross-border mobility process and to design and test digital services that address these needs in an integrated and user-centred way. The research involves qualitative and quantitative methods to gather data from stakeholders and citizens in different cross-border mobility scenarios, including interviews, surveys, and usability testing. The research results provide insights into the potential of the user journey approach for enhancing cross-border mobility and inform the development of digital services that support seamless and efficient cross-border mobility. © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - There is a variety of visual human-machine interfaces (HMI) designed across vehicle manufacturers that support drivers while supervising driving automation features, such as adaptive cruise control (ACC). These various designs communicate the same limited amount of information to drivers about their ACC system and it is unclear which HMI designs impact driver distraction the least or how their design could be modified to help drivers develop more accurate mental models of their ACC system. Using a user-centred design (UCD) approach, we designed a speedometer to inform drivers about some of the system’s capabilities and then invited 23 drivers to use ACC in a low-fidelity driving simulator to compare the usability of three HMIs using eye-tracking, response times, and qualitative data. Our attempt at designing an intuitive and more informative speedometer received mixed results, but design recommendations are given regarding the indication of the set target speed, set time gap between vehicles (headway distance), and system mode (conventional or adaptive cruise). Practitioner summary: Manufacturers’ heterogeneous designs of their visual HMIs for the ACC systems may impact driver distraction in different ways. We used usability testing to compare three HMIs in a driving simulator and make several design recommendations to indicate speed, time gap, and system mode in a more efficient way.

AB  - The integration of Generative AI into the Design Thinking Process introduces new possibilities for UX/UI design, particularly in mobile app development. This study focuses on creating a fitness app prototype for next-generation users, with Generative AI acting as a co-creator across the Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test phases. Two sets of low-fidelity wireframes were developed: one by human UX/UI designers using Figma, and the other by AI using Visily.ai. These prototypes were evaluated through A/B testing, where users completed tasks on both designs, with their experiences measured using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and qualitative interviews. The findings compare human-designed and AI-generated prototypes, offering insights into their strengths and weaknesses. The study also introduces the AI-Driven User Experience (AID-UX) Framework, which outlines a structured method for integrating AI into UX/UI design, from data analysis to iterative testing. Results indicate that while AI-generated designs excel in creativity and efficiency, they lack the nuanced understanding required for human-centered design. This research highlights best practices for human-AI collaboration, emphasizing the balance between AI capabilities and human creativity. The study offers guidance for future AI-assisted design practices, promoting a collaborative approach that leverages both human and AI strengths.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Graphs can be leveraged to model polyphonic multitrack symbolic music, where notes, chords and entire sections may be linked at different levels of the musical hierarchy by tonal and rhythmic relationships. Nonetheless, there is a lack of works that consider graph representations in the context of deep learning systems for music generation. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a novel graph representation for music and a deep Variational Autoencoder that generates the structure and the content of musical graphs separately, one after the other, with a hierarchical architecture that matches the structural priors of music. By separating the structure and content of musical graphs, it is possible to condition generation by specifying which instruments are played at certain times. This opens the door to a new form of human-computer interaction in the context of music co-creation. After training the model on existing MIDI datasets, the experiments show that the model is able to generate appealing short and long musical sequences and to realistically interpolate between them, producing music that is tonally and rhythmically consistent. Finally, the visualization of the embeddings shows that the model is able to organize its latent space in accordance with known musical concepts. © 2023 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite significant recent changes to the doctoral training environment, particularly provision of employability skills during candidature, there is a paucity of research investigating best practice in this area. This paper describes a case study in how various pedagogical theories, curriculum co-creation, lifelong learner, adult learning, cognitive load, spiral learning, reflective practice, and community of practice theories, were applied at an Australian university to develop and implement a Graduate Certificate aimed at increasing work readiness by delivering research and employability skills training to PhD candidates. Outlined are the rationale, student interest and theoretical basis underpinning this program, and its integrated suite of work-integrated learning (WIL) activities. Comparison against an emerging framework for high quality WIL demonstrated key alignments between the program and the quality WIL framework. These alignments highlight important considerations for comprehensive training of PhD candidates, together with recommendations for future research into WIL and employability training for PhD candidates. © 2023 International Journal of Work-Integrated Learning.

AB  - To better understand the internal logic of design knowledge and the development context and trend of service platforms, it is essential to sort out and review the literature on related topics. Based on the Web of Science database, this paper selects the literature related to design knowledge and service platforms from 2000 to 2021 as the research sample and combines CiteSpace and VOSviewer knowledge graph software to conduct a visual analysis of the literature data. The results show that: (1) The research on design knowledge service platforms (DKSP) started late, but with the development of science and technology in recent years, the attention of all academic community to DKSP gradually increases; (2) The DKSP belongs to an interdisciplinary research, involving computer, economy, management, education, art, and other fields; (3) The development of DKSP is closely related to information technology. The application of new technology and the demand for popularization make it gradually embark on the road of social media and commercialization. (4) An interactive knowledge platform network is the future of DKSP, with the goal of multi-participant co-creation, platform knowledge sharing, and multi-value symbiosis.  © 2023 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to develop an app to improve patients’ adherence to therapy for osteoporosis and to test its usability. Methods: In Phase I, the app functions needed to improve medication adherence were identified through a focus group with six patients with osteoporosis and a joint interview with two bone specialists. The app prototype was then developed (Phase II) and refined after its feasibility testing (Phase III) for 13–25 days by eight patients. Finally, the app underwent usability testing (Phase IV) for 6 months by nine other patients. The mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (MAUQ) was used to collect the assessment of the app by the 17 patients. Results: The final version of the app provided information on osteoporosis, allowed patients to contact the bone specialist for an additional consultation, and generated a reminder for taking medications accompanied by feedback on adherence. The assessment of the app was positive but evaluations differed between the feasibility and usability testing, with the former displaying a significantly (p ≤.05) better assessment across all MAUQ items. Conclusions: In this study, we tested an app for improving adherence to medical therapies in patients with osteoporosis. The usability testing revealed a lower “patient-centered” performance of the app as compared to that observed during the feasibility phase. Future developments of the study include increasing the testing cohort and adding a technical support during the usability testing. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Background: Pictograms may improve user-friendliness and comprehension of written or verbal health information. This paper describes a method to modify pictograms to improve their visual clarity, appeal and overall interpretive complexity in order to reduce the cognitive load on the viewer during comprehension. Methodology: Nine pictograms previously tested for comprehension were selected for modification. In phase 1, two participatory design workshops were conducted with (a) three limited literacy, first-language isiXhosa-speaking participants and (b) four university students. Opinions and ideas for improving interpretation were discussed. In phase 2, revised visuals were generated by the graphic artist and subsequently modified in an intensive, multistage, iterative process. Results: As no guidelines for pictogram modification exist, a modification schema was developed based on the process described in this study. Adopting a participatory approach combined with a systematic, intensive modification process enabled the opinions and preferences of the end-users to be heard, ensuring cultural relevance and contextual familiarity of the final product. Careful scrutiny of all individual visual elements of each pictogram, considerations of space, and thickness of lines all contributed to improving the legibility of visuals. Conclusions: The methodology for designing and modifying existing pictograms using a participatory process resulted in nine final pictograms that were approved by all design team members and considered good candidates for subsequent comprehension testing. The methodological schema presented in this paper provides guidance to researchers intending to design or modify pictograms. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Since life expectancy has increased significantly over the past century, society is being forced to discover innovative ways to support active aging and elderly care. The e-VITA project, which receives funding from both the European Union and Japan, is built on a cutting edge method of virtual coaching that focuses on the key areas of active and healthy aging. The requirements for the virtual coach were ascertained through a process of participatory design in workshops, focus groups, and living laboratories in Germany, France, Italy, and Japan. Several use cases were then chosen for development utilising the open-source Rasa framework. The system uses common representations such as Knowledge Bases and Knowledge Graphs to enable the integration of context, subject expertise, and multimodal data, and is available in English, German, French, Italian, and Japanese. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Over the past few years, the number of teams collaborating through video conferences has significantly increased. The research presented in this paper addresses the question of how structural information of online communication can be visualized in a way that enables such teams to learn from it and improve their collaboration. Structural information about communication refers to interaction patterns, airtime distribution, and other data reflecting the communication dynamics of a conversation. By examining six case studies conducted using a participatory design science approach and reviewing previous research, a set of criteria was developed for creating helpful visualizations in these contexts. The data from this research shows that more helpful visualizations were also considered more complex and less easy to read. We, therefore, propose that the setting in which these visualizations are presented should be designed to ensure that the purpose and form of each graphic are adequately explained to the respective recipients. Additionally, the case studies indicated that self-organized teams have a higher affinity for more complex visualizations compared to hierarchically led teams. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Ferizy is an online ferry ticket booking application managed by PT ASDP Indonesia Ferry. Based on the Apple App Store's review, Ferizy users mentioned that the application is difficult to use, impractical, and lacks security. The app's rating on the Apple App Store is only 2.6 out of 5. Therefore, the Ferizy application needs to be redesigned in such a way as to improve user comfort and usability. In this final project, a research study will be conducted to design an interaction design that can address the issues in the Ferizy app. The research will be conducted using the user-centered design method, which means the design process will prioritize and revolve around the users' needs. The three golden rules will also be applied in the interaction design process. To identify the problems and user needs, a questionnaire will be distributed to eticketing app users, and interviews will be conducted with Ferizy app users. The problems and needs that were found were then designed into a high-fidelity prototype developed using the Flutter framework. The results of the high-fidelity prototype design will be tested using two usability testing methods: The System Usability Scale (SUS) and the Single Ease Question (SEQ). The testing results show that all tasks in the SEQ testing were completed with a 100% success rate, based on the last testing using high-fidelity prototype iteration 2. The average SEQ score obtained from the high-fidelity prototype testing is 6.97 out of a maximum score of 7. This indicates that the designed prototype meets the usability goals of being effective to use and having good usability. The next testing conducted was the SEQ testing, and the average SEQ score obtained from the high-fidelity prototype testing was 98 out of a maximum score of 100. This shows that the designed prototype meets the usability goals of being efficient to use.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Educational games have become increasingly prevalent as practical tools to engage students and enhance their learning experiences. The previous study demonstrates the effectiveness of games in strengthening children's cognitive skills. However, there are no further studies regarding games that simultaneously improve counting skills and memory retention. This research addresses this gap by developing a game that integrates these two cognitive domains. 'Count and Remember' is a game that provides a comprehensive educational tool designed to aid in developing mathematical and cognitive skills in young learners by combining counting exercises with memory challenges. The game features interactive counting tasks, memory games, a child-friendly interface, progress tracking, and a rewards system. This study employs instructional and user-centered game design principles involving iterative prototyping and student feedback. Initial usability testing indicates that the game is both engaging and educationally effective. The findings suggest that 'Count and Remember' is well received by children and considered attractive, fun, and challenging. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Government websites serve as sources of information and services related to public affairs, playing an essential role in connecting citizens with government institutions. The responsibility of government websites extends beyond just providing information; they must ensure that the information is easily accessible and understandable. This paper analyzes and redesigns the United States Department of Labor’s website. The research began by examining user-generated content on social media and online forums, shedding light on user grievances and challenges. The analysis revealed a significant issue with the website’s information architecture, causing users to need help finding the information they needed. A heuristic evaluation was conducted, and issues related to problems with usability heuristics, including “Help and documentation,” “Visibility of system status,” and “Aesthetic and minimalist design,” were also identified. To initiate the redesign, a virtual card sorting activity engaged potential users to reorganize content and categories. User interface (UI) components were developed, presenting a fresh color palette aligned with the Department of Labor’s branding. Remote Usability Testing (RUT) with seven diverse users, leading to further refinements for responsiveness and consistency. Usability tests on the prototypes demonstrated the value of a user-centric approach. If implemented on the United States government website, this redesign could alleviate user pain points, particularly information accessibility. In conclusion, optimizing government website information architecture is vital for improving user experience. This research and redesign process serves as a valuable case study for enhancing the usability of government online platforms, ultimately benefiting citizens and their interactions with government services. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Conversational recommender systems are increasingly studied to provide more fine-tuned recommendations based on user preferences. However, most existing product recommendation approaches in online stores are designed to interact with people through questions that mainly focus on products or their attributes, and less on buyers’ core purchase needs. This work proposes ClayBot, a novel conversational recommendation agent, which aims to capture people’s intents and recommend products based on the jobs or actions that their buyers aim to do. Interactions with ClayBot are guided by an openly accessible knowledge graph, which connects a sample of computing products to the actions annotated in product reviews. A demonstration of ClayBot is presented as an Amazon Alexa Skill to showcase the feasibility of handling more human-centered interactions in the product recommendation and explanation process. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG. 2023.

AB  - Due to the COVID-19, Indonesia has enforced regulations requiring people to monitor their own health at home. Doctor's assistance is essential, leading to healthcare services utilizing telemedicine platforms. However, existing telemedicine platforms can't help doctors to directly assess patients using at-home medical instruments connected to an app. To address this gap, a device named Respinos has been developed to capture and transmit patients' vital data. This data is harnessed by the Respinos Health application, allowing users to comprehend their health status while consulting with doctors. Employing the user-centered design method, Respinos Health is designed to encourage patients to do self-examination using Respinos regularly. The design process started with user research to formulate a list of features, including features with a touch of personalization such as reminder and consultation. It proceeded with prototype creation, encompassing both low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes, each tested to get a design that meets the usability goals and user experience goals of Respinos Health, namely easy-to-learn, efficient-to-use, helpful, and engaging. The final result of usability testing for the high-fidelity prototype yielded the following outcomes: 6.63 for SEQ, 98.89% for completion rate, 85.8 for SUS, 6.64 for IMI subscale value/usefulness, and 4.22 for UES-SF.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Various older adult care settings have embraced the use of the life story approach to enhance the development of comprehensive care plans. However, organizing life stories and extracting useful information is labor-intensive, primarily due to the repetitive, fragmented, and redundant nature of life stories gathered from everyday communication scenarios. Existing life story systems, while available, do not adequately fulfill the requirements of users, especially in the application of care services. Objective: The objective of this study is to design, develop, and evaluate a digital system that provides caregivers with the necessary tools to view and manage the life stories of older adults, enabling expedited access to pertinent information effectively and visually. Methods: This study used a multidisciplinary, user-centered design approach across 4 phases: initial design requirements, prototyping, prototype refinement workshops, and usability testing. During the initial phase, we conducted field research in the Hefei Tianyu Senior Living Service Nursing Home, China, to discover how caregivers currently store and use life stories and their needs, challenges, and obstacles in organizing and retrieving information. Subsequently, we designed a low-fidelity prototype according to the users’ requirements. A prototyping workshop involving 6 participants was held to collaboratively design and discuss the prototype’s function and interaction. User feedback from the workshops was used to optimize the prototype, leading to the development of the system. We then designed 2 rounds of usability testing with 7 caregivers to evaluate the system’s usability and effectiveness. Results: We identified 3 categories of functionalities that are necessary to include in the design of our initial low-fidelity prototype of life story visualizations: life story input, life story organization, and timeline generation. Subsequently, through the workshops, we identified 3 categories for functional optimization: feedback on user interface and usability, optimization suggestions for existing features, and the request for additional functionalities. Next, we designed a medium-fidelity prototype based on human-centered design. The Story Mosaic system underwent usability testing in the Hefei Tianyu Senior Living Service Nursing Home. Overall, 7 users recorded and organized 1123 life stories of 16 older adults. The usability testing results indicated that the system was accessible and easy to use for caregivers. Based on the feedback from the usability testing, we finalized the high-fidelity prototype. Conclusions: We designed, developed, and evaluated the Story Mosaic system to support the visual management of older adults’ life stories. This system empowers caregivers through digital technology and innovative design, pioneering personal narrative integration in caregiving. This system can expand to include informal caregivers and family members for continued adaptability and empathy. © Fang Gui, Jiaoyun Yang, Qilin Wu, Yang Liu, Jia Zhou, Ning An.

AB  - This study conducted task-based usability testing to evaluate “the Integrated Information System for People with Disabilities of National Taiwan Library.” Adopted observation analysis to record the user’s retrieval process and problems, supplemented by in-depth interviews, to explore the user’s opinions after testing. Questionnaires also were taken to measure the awareness for the learnability, memorability, error frequency and severity, efficiency and satisfaction of the system. The results are summarized as follows: (1) Personalized service functions generate the most operating errors and take the most time. (2) Visually-impaired persons have a high frequency of “operation hesitation” and “questioning,” and the time to complete tasks is higher than other types of impaired persons. (3) Most of the reasons for the error are improper design of the function key position. (4) The sorting of search results and the operation process of search have high lostness in web pages. (5) The position of the system operation instructions is not obvious and the textual description is lengthy. According to the result, the suggestions of usability design have been proposed for improving the system interface. © 2022, National Taiwan University, Department of Library and Information Science.

AB  - Purpose: Social hackathons are events designed to craft social change using technology that enables citizen empowerment or addresses societal issues by deploying data. Hackathons provide a framework for organizing to help create prototypes and business models through interaction with technology. The relevance of the sociomateriality of the emergent technology (prototype) and organizational structure raises the question if viable and impactful solutions can be developed within such frames. Design/methodology/approach: This study applies an inductive research methodology based on ethnographic participant observation, interviews with participants and event organizers, and qualitative insights from surveys. Findings: Events such as social hackathons are centered around technology and share a vision of creating opportunities for change. The materiality of prototypes may define their interaction patterns. The differentiation of the embodiment and emergent structuration of technology may be a breaking point for in-group dynamics and a barrier to social innovation. The emergent structuration of technology with a longer initial phase of problem definition and ideation within a group was found to have more potential for impactful embodiment with the technological artifact. Some cases reveal that “expert” participants who shared visions of change enabled by technology were constrained by other members. Originality/value: The paper suggests an extended view on the connection of sociomateriality, organizing and social impact. © 2023, Julianna Faludi.

AB  - A user interface is any system that supports human-machine interaction (HMI) or human-computer interaction (HCI). This chapter explores various types of user interfaces, from the graphical user interface to more advanced technologies incorporating touch, voice, virtual and augmented reality, and wearables. The chapter introduces the four phases of user-centered design (UCD), the primary approach to interface design. UCD treats end users as the focus of the design process and aims to make user interaction as easy as possible so that users can accomplish activities and tasks in the most efficient and natural way possible. Usability and usability testing are explained as methods for measuring people's experience with a user interface. User interface components like navigation, menus, and forms are introduced. Techniques for managing hierarchy, organizing content, and personalizing and customizing the user experience are also discussed. © 2024 Taylor & Francis. All rights reserved.

AB  - We present a wearable device that enhances auditory attention and memory by monitoring the environment for relevant auditory information, storing it, alerting the user to it, and playing back the information. This paper presents the design concept of the wearable device and its empirical evaluation. Using a within-subject design, participants' cognitive and perceptual performance was compared with and without auditory augmentation. Participants were presented with a dual task in which they had to monitor an auditory message for a specific keyword while completing a reading comprehension task. Results showed that the wearable device successfully enhanced auditory attention and memory by taking over the listening task, thereby freeing up cognitive resources for the reading task. In addition, participants' self-assessment indicated that the auditory augmentation was successfully integrated into cognitive and perceptual processes, reducing distraction, and increasing perceived calmness. © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) marks a significant milestone in innovations, particularly with the advent of Virtual Beings (VBs) and Mixed Reality. VBs have transitioned from rudimentary programmed characters to elaborate, interactive entities capable of sophisticated human engagement. Enhanced with emotional intelligence, adaptive learning, and context-sensitivity, VBs offer nuanced interactions within both digital and real-world settings. A key breakthrough in this field is the development of affective VBs, which possess the ability to comprehend and react to human emotions, challenging the traditional view of AI as emotionless and strictly logical. This evolution prompts a reexamination of AI’s societal role and the dynamics of Human-Computer Interaction. This study focuses on the complexities of VBs, particularly through the implementation of a virtual being named PLEA, manifested in both worlds: the virtual and the physical one through a robotic head. It discusses the utility of such agents in various applications and employs ethnographic communication methodologies for data collection and analysis to unearth interaction patterns. Additionally, it examines human reactions to PLEA through a user-centered design approach, highlighting interactions based solely on facial expressions between PLEA and human participants. This investigation aims to lay the groundwork for developing multidisciplinary methods to collect, analyze, and abstract data from real-time interactions and feedback sessions, advancing the discourse on AI’s integration into human social environments. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Maintaining technical documentation is a challenge. Products are becoming more complex, product lifecycles are getting shorter, and the number of product variants is increasing. Manuals that guide personnel in the use and maintenance of products are critical to their efficient and safe operation. Authoring system for technical documentation therefore increasingly apply semantic models to control the cost of maintaining technical documentation. Working with formal semantic structures is challenging for technical writers who usually work with plain, written text. This paper presents an intuitive interface for a semantic knowledge graph to facilitate the adoption and use of semantic models in technical documentation. The interface allows working with unstructured text and to postpone its semantification. Users can add semantic annotations in an iterative and incremental way. The interface was developed using a user-centered design process and subjected to an evaluation with technical writers. The results indicate that technical writers could use the prototype successfully and enjoyed the underlying concepts. Further iterations will extend the system and, for example, use artificial intelligence to suggest semantic links to improve the quality of the knowledge graph. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Online courses in continuing education often entail a self-paced format, resulting in high levels of autonomy for adult learners. This autonomy, however, requires learners to self-regulate their learning process. Research has shown that self-regulated learning (SRL) in online courses can be challenging, and support might therefore be needed. While there is evidence that adaptive support systems can improve students’ SRL in formal school and higher education settings, little is known about adaptive SRL support in continuing education online courses. The present paper addresses this research gap applying a design-based research approach. First, we re-analyzed an existing dataset that comprises survey data of 60 adult learners from four course iterations and matched survey measures on learning processes with learners’ perceptions of their SRL strategy use. The analyses revealed that adult learners especially struggled with structuring their learning environment and managing learning time. Based on these findings, adaptive support features were iteratively designed to address the identified challenges. We developed a course overview, an adaptive learning-time display, and adaptive highlighting of recommended content. Second, we investigated learners’ perceptions of the design and functionality of these features by means of interactive co-design sessions. Finally, initial usability testing with students was conducted. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Technological innovation has increasingly become important in addressing the most pressing problems in society. To create better and sustainable solutions, project teams often strive to bring the people they are designed for to the innovation process. While the human-centered design approach has become popular in guiding design in the private sector, its place in addressing larger challenges beyond human needs is still not well defined. Using our experiences in designing the WasteWATER app, an open-source decision making tool intended to help design sustainable water reclamation systems, we illustrate the synergy between analytical research and human-centered design, through the convergence of design and anthropology in creating applied outcomes in universities. Analytical research can help understand complex problems such as the sustainability of water reclamation. At the same time, embedding design thinking in applied research projects can help researchers in academic institutions refine their solutions through collaborative and iterative design with stakeholders.  © 2023 by the Society for Applied Anthropology.

AB  - This study assessed primary care providers’ (PCPs) perceptions of the usability of an electronic medical record tool to support physical activity counseling in primary care. Our analyses revealed that usability improved when the electronic medical record tool followed a PCP’s natural workflow and when the tool could assist in engaging in a discussion about physical activity. Poor usability was associated with the presence of large amounts of text on the screen and technological aspects that required additional learning. Overall, efficiency, workflow integration, and the inclusion of a care plan were vital in a physical activity counseling tool for a primary care setting. © 2020 by Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

AB  - We implemented a user-centered approach to the design of an artificial intelligence (AI) system that provides users with access to information about the workings of the United States federal court system regardless of their technical background. Presently, most of the records associated with the federal judiciary are provided through a federal system that does not support exploration aimed at discovering systematic patterns about court activities. In addition, many users lack the data analytical skills necessary to conduct their own analyses and convert data into information. We conducted interviews, observations, and surveys to uncover the needs of our users and discuss the development of an intuitive platform informed from these needs that makes it possible for legal scholars, lawyers, and journalists to discover answers to more advanced questions about the federal court system. We report on results from usability testing and discuss design implications for AI and law practitioners and researchers. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The present article reviews the current status of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions for anxiety and depression in Japanese youth. First, a literature review of youth CBT programs for anxiety and depression is provided. Through this process, we identify which program/protocol has been most researched within Japan. Second, through a systematic interview to the authors, the development process of four predominant programs is outlined. The programs included were a family CBT program for anxiety disorders (the Japanese Anxiety Children/Adolescents Cognitive Behavior Therapy program), two school-based prevention programs for anxiety and depression (Journey of the Brave and Phoenix Time), and a transdiagnostic protocol for anxiety and depression (Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Children and the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Adolescents). Third, cultural adaptation and modification of the programs are discussed from the scope of user-centered design principles as described by Lyon and Koerner (Sci Pract 23:180–200, 2016). As a result, changes in program content and material, as represented by the use of culture-friendly program names, acronyms, illustrations, and characters were endorsed in all of the programs. Structured but flexible session formats helped increase learnability and efficiency while keeping the cognitive load of providers and consumers low. A careful selection of providers, as well as quality training and consultation are important factors to maximize competency and ensure appropriate implementation. Application of existing time frames and staff who work in each setting were effective ways to increase scalability. Overall, it was shown that many of the modifications adopted overlap among successful programs; these represent the most basic and essential requirements for a program to be applicable to a wide range of contexts. Implications and further directions are explored. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - As artificial intelligence conversational agent (CA) usage is increasing, research has been done to explore how to improve chatbot user experience by focusing on user personality. This work aims to help designers and industrial professionals understand user trust related to personality in CAs for better human-centered AI design. To achieve this goal, the study investigates the interactions between users with diverse personalities and AI chatbots. We measured participant personalities with a Hogan and Champagnes (1980) typology assessment by categorizing personality dimensions into the extraversion vs. intuition (EN), extraversion vs. sensing (ES), introversion vs. intuition (IN), and introversion vs. sensing (IS) groups. Twenty-nine participants were assigned two tasks to engage with three different AI chatbots: Cleverbot, Kuki, and Replika. Their conversations with the chatbots were analyzed using the open-coding method. Coding schemes were developed to create frequency tables. Results of this study showed that EN personality participants had perceptions of high trustworthiness towards the chatbot, especially when the chatbot was helpful. The ES personality participants, on the other hand, often engaged in brief conversations regardless of whether the chatbot was helpful or not, leading to low trust levels towards the chatbot. The IN personality users experienced mixed outcomes; while some had perceived trusty-worthy conversations despite having unhelpful chatbot responses, others found helpful conversations, yet a perception of low trustworthiness. The IS personality participants typically had the longest conversations, often leading to high perceptions of high trust scores being given to the chatbots. This study indicates that users with diverse personalities have different perceptions of trust toward AI conversational agents. This research provides interpretations of different personality users’ interaction patterns and trends with chatbots for designers as design guidelines to emphasize AI UX design. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

AB  - Background: Dashboards and interactive displays are becoming increasingly prevalent in most health care settings and have the potential to streamline access to information, consolidate disparate data sources and deliver new insights. Our research focuses on intensive care units (ICUs) which are heavily instrumented, critical care environments that generate vast amounts of data and frequently require individualized support for each patient. Consequently, clinicians experience a high cognitive load, which can translate to suboptimal performance. The global COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this problem by generating a large number of additional hospitalizations, which necessitated a new tool that would help manage ICUs’ census. In a previous study, we interviewed clinicians at the University Hospitals Bristol and Weston National Health Service Foundation Trust to capture the requirements for bespoke dashboards that would alleviate this problem. Objective: This study aims to design, implement, and evaluate an ICU dashboard to allow for monitoring of the high volume of patients in need of critical care, particularly tailored to high-demand situations, such as those seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Building upon the previously gathered requirements, we developed a dashboard, integrated it within the ICU of a National Health Service trust, and allowed all staff to access our tool. For evaluation purposes, participants were recruited and interviewed following a 25-day period during which they were able to use the dashboard clinically. The semistructured interviews followed a topic guide aimed at capturing the usability of the dashboard, supplemented with additional questions asked post hoc to probe themes established during the interview. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a thematic analysis framework that combined inductive and deductive approaches and integrated the Technology Acceptance Model. Results: A total of 10 participants with 4 different roles in the ICU (6 consultants, 2 junior doctors, 1 nurse, and 1 advanced clinical practitioner) participated in the interviews. Our analysis generated 4 key topics that prevailed across the data: our dashboard met the usability requirements of the participants and was found useful and intuitive; participants perceived that it impacted their delivery of patient care by improving the access to the information and better equipping them to do their job; the tool was used in a variety of ways and for different reasons and tasks; and there were barriers to integration of our dashboard into practice, including familiarity with existing systems, which stifled the adoption of our tool. Conclusions: Our findings show that the perceived utility of the dashboard had a positive impact on the clinicians’ workflows in the ICU. Improving access to information translated into more efficient patient care and transformed some of the existing processes. The introduction of our tool was met with positive reception, but its integration during the COVID-19 pandemic limited its adoption into practice. ©Marceli Wac, Ian Craddock, Sofia Chantziara, Tabitha Campbell, Raul Santos-Rodriguez, Brittany Davidson, Chris McWilliams.

AB  - It is becoming increasingly attractive to detect human emotions using electroencephalography (EEG) brain signals. EEG is a reliable and cost-effective technology used to measure brain activities. This paper proposes an original framework for usability testing based on emotion detection using EEG signals, which can significantly affect software production and user satisfaction. This approach can provide an in-depth understanding of user satisfaction accurately and precisely, making it a valuable tool in software development. The proposed framework includes a recurrent neural network algorithm as a classifier, a feature extraction algorithm based on event-related desynchronization and event-related synchronization analysis, and a new method for selecting EEG sources adaptively for emotion recognition. The framework results are promising, achieving 92.13%, 92.67%, and 92.24% for the valence–arousal–dominance dimensions, respectively. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - With the continuous development of China's social and economic development, the rising production and supply capacity, and the competition between enterprises continues to intensify, corporate marketing activities pay more and more attention to the role of consumer participation. At the same time, ‘how to create a strong brand’ has also become one of the most hotly debated topics among enterprises today. Currently, the experience economy is on the rise globally, and the role of user experience in brand marketing is being paid more and more attention. Although China scholars have repeatedly researched in this field, yet few research have yet further sorted out the association between user experience and brand marketing, and summarized and analyzed them through knowledge mapping tools in China. Therefore, this paper selects journal articles included in China Knowledge Network (CNKI) since the starting year of user experience and brand association research from year 2006 to October 2022 as the research objects via scientific bibliometric methods, and uses CiteSpace visual literature analysis software for comprehensive analysis. The results show that: 1) domestic research on user experience and brand started in year 2006; 2) the keyword co-occurrence analysis based on knowledge graph indicates that the research mainly focuses on user experience, consumer and brand, consumer, and brand image; and 3) the knowledge maps suggest that the research on the connection between experience design and brand marketing is relatively scattered, with low cooperation density, and no large disciplinary team has been formed yet. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The use of Digital Behaviour Change Interventions (DBCIs) to form, alter, and maintain health-related behaviour is increasing in people's daily lives. Designing DBCIs for health behaviour change requires contributions from both behaviour intervention designers and interaction designers. Intervention Design (INTD) is a well-established psychological practice that guides the process of designing behaviour change interventions based on psychological theory. Interaction Design (IxD) helps design a digital product's overall structure and interactive behaviour, typically in line to the user's preferences, needs, and goals. IxD approaches such as Activity-Centred Design, User-Centred Design, and Goal-Directed Design (GDD) are used to facilitate the design process of digital products. While several frameworks are proposed to design DBCIs for health behaviour change, it is still unclear to what extent INTD and IxD approaches are integrated into these DBCIs for health behaviour change. The current paper aims to use GDD as a referential model to map existing frameworks of DBCIs for health behaviour change to identify to what extent and how these frameworks guide the combining INTD and IxD processes. Results indicate that all DBCIs for health behaviour change frameworks include the INTD phase. The specific IxD methods such as user research, prototyping and usability testing are reported more frequently in frameworks for designing DBCIs. None of the frameworks for designing DBCI for health behaviour change implemented any structured IxD frameworks. The absence of clear guidance for IxD designers who aim to design DBCI for health behaviour change represents a knowledge gap in the field of IxD. More guidelines on IxD methodology are needed to integrate IxD methods with INTD for designing effective DBCIs for health behaviour change.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Within the realm of teacher education, effective tools as support can enhance pre-service teachers' comprehension of STEM concepts and their ability to tackle with complex problems. This research aims to empirically investigate the impact of ChatGPT-supported collaborative learning on pre-service teachers' STEM teaching literacy, learning performance, and cognitive load. A total of 36 sophomore undergraduate pre-service teachers participated in an 8-week quasi-experimental study (with classes lasting 3 hours each week). These pre-service teachers were tasked with creating teaching aids and simulating instructional sessions. The experimental group engaged in small-group collaborative learning assisted by ChatGPT (N=21), while the control group (N=15) conducted conventional collaborative learning. The results indicate that pre-service teachers using ChatGPT demonstrated superior performance in terms of learning performance and cognitive load, though the improvement in STEM teaching literacy was not evident. However, ChatGPT contributed to students' acquisition and comprehension of STEM teaching knowledge. In essence, within a collaborative learning context, ChatGPT exhibits significant potential in addressing complex issues and offering personalized support but also we should mitigate potential risks. Collaborative learning with human-machine co-creation is poised to be a trend in the future of education, offering innovative avenues for the cultivation of STEM pre-service teachers. © 2023 ACM.

AB  - Background: A tailored and integrated technology solution (patient mHealth application and provider dashboard) can provide a 360° view of Medicaid-enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) during pregnancy that could improve health outcomes and address health inequities. Objectives: To develop a set of user specifications for the mHealth and dashboard applications, develop prototypes based on user needs, and collect initial impressions of the prototypes to subsequently develop refined tools that are ready for deployment. Methods: Study activities followed a double-diamond framework with a participatory design mindset. Activities were divided into two phases focused on a qualitative inquiry about participant needs and values (phase 1) and design, development, and usability testing of low and high-fidelity prototypes (phase 2). Results: We identified themes that exemplified pregnancy experience among Medicaid-enrolled individuals with T2D. Patients (n = 7) and providers (n = 7) expressed a core set of expectations for the mHealth and dashboard applications. Participants provided feedback to improve the mHealth and dashboard. For both applications, participants reported scores for the NASA Task load Survey (TLX) that were in the 20th percentile of national TLX scores. Conclusions: Digital health tools have the ability to transform health care among Medicaid-enrolled patients with T2D during pregnancy, with the goal of managing their blood glucose levels, which is a precursor to experiencing a successful pregnancy and birth. Distilling patient and provider needs and preferences—then using them, along with prior studies and theory, to develop applications—holds great potential in tackling complicated health care issues. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Design for Intuitive Use is based upon knowledge from previous experiences. People with low digital literacy lack this knowledge, causing difficulties and exclusion from the digital society. In this research project, we focus on Design for Learnability as a new paradigm that challenges the state of the art in UX Design to foster inclusion and participation. To empower this group, so called Hybrid Anchor Points are established in local communities. We use an Interactive Tabletop Projection (ITP), which facilitates access to simplify participation. Further it allows for collaborative exploration and learning, taking into account the needs of people with low digital literacy, focusing on first-use learnability, during-use support and low cognitive load. A pilot study showed a significant reduction in user errors and help interventions. This research shows that design for learnability, combined with an ITP, can simplify access to the digital society and further advance inclusion and participation. © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - The reliability of software interfaces has become increasingly recognized as a crucial factor impacting the quality, manageability, and efficiency of various software systems. Traditional approaches to software reliability assessment often overlook interface-level reliability, focusing primarily on system-level metrics. However, the growing emphasis on user-centered design has amplified the demand for reliable and user-friendly software interfaces. This paper introduces a novel information model for evaluating the reliability of software interface design, which is crucial for enhancing assessment approaches in software engineering. The proposed model integrates usability testing and reliability attributes early in the software development life cycle (SDLC), particularly in the interface design phase, to enhance the system's overall performance and user experience. The paper describes the current state of models and methods used to evaluate software reliability at the interface design level, outlining the problems that the proposed new model aims to solve. It presents the theoretical basis for the model and provides information on its integration into the SDLC. Analytical examples are used to corroborate the proposed model, demonstrating its usefulness in the early project stages and its ability to improve software interface reliability and practicality. The paper also discusses challenges in adoption and suggests areas for future theoretical and empirical research. By developing a more comprehensive perspective on software quality, this work paves the way for practical, reliable, and user-friendly interfaces across various software domains. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - The use of data is crucial in many factors, especially when it comes to decision-making. Too much data, however, can be overwhelming. Mistakes in data analysis can occur if data is not presentable or incomprehensible for users to understand. This study aims to create a fitting data monitoring tool that is easily understood. In this paper, we will design a dashboard to monitor alum performance in a job fair application. This dashboard uses the Human-Centered Design method, which focuses on user requirements. The design solution is evaluated using usability testing with three aspects of the dashboard's usability. The test results show that the success rate of the dashboard is 75%, the time-based efficiency is 0,0364 goals/second, and user satisfaction, measured using the DATUS questionnaire, gets a mean score of 86 out of 100. Furthermore, in-depth interviews with end-users are conducted to investigate user experience when operating the dashboard.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The popularity of batik reflects consumer demands for purchasing fulfillment. Digital technology can bring several advantages and new opportunities to the custom batik design process. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a popular digital tool used. This paper will provide the new User Interface (UI) design of CAD custom design batik, namely Batik 4.0. It’s software developed to provide services, such as pattern customization in various sizes, batik character input system, pricing, and production time estimation utilized by the batik industry in Indonesia that can be directly forwarded to the manufacturing process. Research in UI design for CAD batik has not been studied, and this paper will fill the significant gap and upgrade the usability. This evaluation will test the usability of the test, employing the performance matrix and RTA towards UI that already exists. Improvement was made with a wireframe using human-computer interaction (HCI) and usability testing data. User-centered design (UCD) focuses on the role of the user in the process of system development as the wireframe design method. This research shows UI wireframe design for several types of users. In making the UI wireframe design, a usability evaluation was performed again. The evaluation result shows that the new user prototypes have fewer errors and exceed the usability value compared to the previous one. The new design is more user-friendly and can be used as a reference for the future development and improvement of CAD custom batik. © (2024), (International Journal on Advanced Science).

AB  - Background: From the project’s inception, STAR-Vote was intended to be one of the first usable, end-to-end (e2e) voting systems with sophisticated security. To realize STAR-Vote, computer security experts, statistical auditors, human factors (HF)/human-computer interaction (HCI) researchers, and election officials collaborated throughout the project and relied upon a user-centered, iterative design and development process, which included human factors research and usability testing, to make certain the system would be both usable and secure. Objective: While best practices in HF/HCI methods for design were used and all apparent usability problems were identified and fixed, summative system usability assessments were conducted toward the end of the user-centered design process to determine whether STAR-Vote is in fact easy to use. Method and Results: After collecting efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction measurements per ISO 9241-11’s system usability criteria, an analysis of the data revealed that there is evidence for STAR-Vote being the most usable, cryptographically secure voting system to date when compared with the previously tested e2e systems: Helios, Prêt à Voter, and Scantegrity. Conclusion and Application: STAR-Vote being one of the first e2e voting systems that is both highly usable and secure is a significant accomplishment, because tamper-resistant voting systems can be used in U.S. elections to ensure the integrity of the electoral process, while still ensuring that voter intent is accurately reflected in the cast ballots. Moreover, this research empirically shows that a complex, secure system can still be usable—meaning that implemented security is not an excuse for poor usability. © 2018, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

AB  - This paper emphasizes the significance of employing methodological approaches rooted in participatory design to facilitate intergenerational collaboration in an age range less studied (generations X to Y) in developing a web-based newsroom for young people. The research stems from the YouNDigital project, funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, which seeks to explore young people’s interaction with news in a digitized society. A key output of the project is the development of the YouNDigital Newsroom, a web-based platform enabling youth from diverse backgrounds to share their views of the world on issues that matter to them. Drawing upon intergenerational collaboration and knowledge transfer, this paper explores the challenges and strategies in creating a platform that reflects researchers’ and users’ diverse perspectives and needs. Through co-design sessions, iterative prototyping, and usability testing, the task navigated complexities within a limited timeframe and resources to foster user engagement and ownership. The main objective was to engage users with a web-based Newsroom to generate meaningful content that reflects their perspectives on matters of interest. The design thinking sessions and continuous collaborative work were instrumental in defining potential user profiles (personas) and delineating usage contexts for each persona. The findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse perspectives and collaborative design methodologies in addressing multifaceted challenges and creating inclusive solutions across generations. Leveraging design methodologies facilitated collaboration between researchers and users in developing the YouNDigital newsroom. By incorporating user perspectives from the outset, the project aimed to create a platform that resonates with young people and researchers from different generations’ interests and fosters meaningful engagement with news content in a digital era. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Background: Electronic health records (EHRs) are a promising approach to document and map (complex) health information gathered in health care worldwide. However, possible unintended consequences during use, which can occur owing to low usability or the lack of adaption to existing workflows (eg, high cognitive load), may pose a challenge. To prevent this, the involvement of users in the development of EHRs is crucial and growing. Overall, involvement is designed to be very multifaceted, for example, in terms of the timing, frequency, or even methods used to capture user preferences. Objective: Setting, users and their needs, and the context and practice of health care must be considered in the design and subsequent implementation of EHRs. Many different approaches to user involvement exist, each requiring a variety of methodological choices. The aim of the study was to provide an overview of the existing forms of user involvement and the circumstances they need and to provide support for the planning of new involvement processes. Methods: We conducted a scoping review to provide a database for future projects on which design of inclusion is worthwhile and to show the diversity of reporting. Using a very broad search string, we searched the PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus databases. In addition, we searched Google Scholar. Hits were screened according to scoping review methodology and then examined, focusing on methods and materials, participants, frequency and design of the development, and competencies of the researchers involved. Results: In total, 70 articles were included in the final analysis. There was a wide range of methods of involvement. Physicians and nurses were the most frequently included groups and, in most cases, were involved only once in the process. The approach of involvement (eg, co-design) was not specified in most of the studies (44/70, 63%). Further qualitative deficiencies in the reporting were evident in the presentation of the competences of members of the research and development teams. Think-aloud sessions, interviews, and prototypes were frequently used. Conclusions: This review provides insights into the diversity of health care professionals' involvement in the development of EHRs. It provides an overview of the different approaches in various fields of health care. However, it also shows the necessity of considering quality standards in the development of EHRs together with future users and the need for reporting this in future studies. © Theresa Sophie Busse, Chantal Jux, Johannes Laser, Peter Rasche, Horst Christian Vollmar, Jan P Ehlers, Sven Kernebeck.

AB  - Online programs risk higher student dropout rates. Supporting learning tools such as learning analytics dashboards (LADs) can promote self-regulated learning and positively impact student outcomes. In this paper, a three-level design study is presented that demonstrates the reduction of cognitive load at multiple levels when students are involved in the LAD design process. Through a user-centered design process (including requirements analysis and expert interviews), a wireframe was developed using participatory methods and evaluated by 24 university students using the laws of Gestalt psychology, resulting in a clickable, low-fidelity prototype (LFD). This was then evaluated by 24 university students using the interaction principles of EN ISO 9241-110:2020. The refined LFD was further evaluated with university students in an eye-tracking study using the thinking-aloud technique (n = 10). The feedback emphasized the importance of participatory design and provided critical insights into the most effective use of the LAD and its elements, taking into account cognitive aspects. The results showed significant optimization in the small details and the big picture in the use of content elements, e.g., it is a crucial part to create a navigation structure adapted to the needs of an LAD and it is beneficial to present a reduced level of information during the initial access, with the option to add or access additional elements as needed. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Background: Electronic patient-reported outcome measures (ePROMs) are standardized digital instruments integrated into clinical care to collect subjective data regarding patients’ health-related quality of life, functional status, and symptoms. In documenting patient-reported progress, ePROMs can guide treatment decisions and encourage measurement-based care practices. Voxe is a pediatric and user-centered ePROM platform for patients with chronic health conditions. Objective: We aimed to describe the user-centered design approach involving feedback from end users and usability testing of Voxe’s platform features to support implementation in a pediatric health care setting. Methods: Purposive sampling was used to recruit patients aged 8-17 years from 2 chronic illness populations in 2 pediatric hospitals in Canada. Patients’ health care team members were also purposively recruited. One-on-one iterative testing sessions were conducted digitally by research team members with participants to obtain feedback on the appearance and functionalities of the Voxe platform prototype. Patients and health care providers (HCPs) completed Voxe-related task-based activities. International Organization for Standardization key performance indicators were tracked during HCP task-based activities. HCPs also completed the System Usability Scale. To test platform usability, the think-aloud technique was used by participants during the completion of structured tasks. After completing all task-based activities, patient participants selected 5 words from the Microsoft Desirability Toolkit to describe their overall impression and experience with the Voxe platform. Qualitative data about likes, dislikes, and ease of use were collected through semistructured interviews. Feedback testing sessions were conducted with patients and HCPs until Voxe was acceptable to participating end users, with no further refinements identified. Quantitative and qualitative data analysis were completed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. Results: A total of 49 patients and 38 HCPs were recruited. Patients were positive about Voxe’s child-centered design characteristics and notification settings. HCPs rated Voxe as user-friendly and efficient, with the time to complete tasks decreasing over time. HCPs were satisfied with the Voxe platform functionalities and identified the value of Voxe’s system notifications, summarized display of ePROM results, and its capacity to integrate with electronic medical records. Patients’ and HCPs’ high satisfaction rates with the Voxe prototype highlight the importance of being responsive to user suggestions from the inception of eHealth platform developments to ensure their efficient and effective design. Conclusions: This paper describes the user-centered creation and usability testing of Voxe as an ePROM platform for implementation into clinical care for pediatric patients with chronic health conditions. As a patient-facing platform that can be integrated into electronic medical records, Voxe aligns with measurement-based care practices to foster quality patient-centered approaches to care. End users’ positive feedback and evaluation of the platform’s user-friendliness and efficiency suggest that Voxe represents a valuable and promising solution to systematically integrate patient-related outcome (PRO) data into complex and dynamic clinical health care settings. ©Samantha J Anthony, Sarah J Pol, Enid K Selkirk, Amarens Matthiesen, Robert J Klaassen, Dorin Manase, Amanda Silva, Melanie Barwick, Jennifer N Stinson, Alameen Damer, Mowa Ayibiowu, Selina X Dong, Stephan Oreskovich, Michael Brudno.

AB  - This paper presents ARCA, a software system that enables semantic search and exploration over a book catalog. The main purpose of this work is twofold: to propose a general paradigm for a semantic enrichment workflow and to evaluate a visual approach to information retrieval based on extracted information and existing knowledge graphs. ARCA has been designed and implemented following a user-centered design approach. Two different releases of the system have incrementally and iteratively developed and evaluated. The first release has evaluated the quality and usefulness of the extracted data. The second release, whose design was a refinement based on the previous evaluation results, was assessed by several users. Moreover, a comparative test with other information retrieval systems was conducted in order to study the potential added-value of the system. ARCA is employed in a real editorial scenario to visually search and explore the books of a publishing house. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The mobile applications have been widely used nowadays, with a growing number of elderly individuals incorporating them into their daily lives. Despite the widespread adoption of smartphones and their associated applications, elderly users often encounter usability challenges. Existing literature suggested that these challenges could be attributed to age-related factors and their relative unfamiliarity with technology, all of which affect their interaction with mobile applications. This research endeavors to identify key attributes of user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) suitable for individuals aged 60 and above in Brunei Darussalam, addressing their specific limitations, and subjecting the UI to analyze based on established principles. Identification of appropriate UI characteristics was conducted through a combination of desk research and interviews with senior citizens. BruHealth, a mobile application focused on disseminating COVID-19 related information and services in Brunei Darussalam, served as a case study, and User-Centered Design Model was adopted to guide the enhanced design and development of its UI. Subsequently, a usability testing was conducted to assess the UI and UX of the improved design, aligning it with heuristic principles. The results reveal several areas necessitating improvement in the UI and UX of the application to align with age-related impairments.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - University Management Information Systems (UMIS) are a very essential part of a school’s ecosystem. Trying to build a functional UMIS is no longer a serious issue, these days as students interact with this system to perform tasks such as course registration, school fee payment, etc., the ease at which they do these activities is extremely important, any error or confusing experience they come in contact with can make the process dreadful for these users and demotivate them. This study would be centered on designing the User Interface (UI) and improving the UX of University Management Information Systems for web-based interfaces. User-Centered Design processes and system design thinking methodology were employed to solve the problem. Questionnaires were used to obtain the users' pain points as it relates to the existing UMIS in their schools, the responses were analyzed to understand the users’ pain and issues they face with their current UMIS and then decipher the right features to create a more usable interface. User personas and wireframes were used to make sense of the data obtained from user research. Figma, a visual design and prototyping tool was used for the prototype and interface design. The newly created interfaces were subjected to user testing using a platform called Maze. Users were able to interact with the platform and then answer certain questions as it relates to the developed system. Test data was used to measure usability parameters such as efficiency, effectiveness, learnability, ease of use and simplicity. From the testing phase, the developed system has a System Usability Score (SUS) of 87, it shows that users enjoyed using the system and could navigate through a platform they are interacting with for the first time, with little to no help. it was discovered that users prefer a simpler, responsive, and more interactive interface. Also, users were able to successfully complete tasks even though it is an interface they had never interacted with before. This study would address the usability issues students face while interacting with the UMIS platform provided for them by their institutions and also proposed a responsive and user-centered design which if implemented would improve students engagement on the platform and also reduce the constant problems that may arise from using the UMIS platform. © 2022 International Information and Engineering Technology Association.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the usability and satisfaction of users with the interface of the ‘Agente Escuta’ application, in addition to identifying problems and possibilities for improvement. Methods: Descriptive exploratory translational study, characterized by a usability test with a quantitative and qualitative approach, subdivided into three stages: (I) prior evaluation of usability by 10 judges, including students, primary care professionals, professors and researchers in Information Technology and Speech Therapy; (II) evaluation of the application by the target audience, that is, community health agents from six municipalities in Rio Grande do Norte; (III) evaluation of the satisfaction of the agents who used the application in their work routine. The System Usability Scale and the Net Promoter Score were used, in addition to a qualitative evaluation of the opinions. Results: Usability was rated as excellent by judges, regardless of category. In the evaluation by community health agents, usability was considered good and there was no effect of the city of origin. It was found that the perception of the judges and the target audience were different, with a lower score for the participants in the second stage. However, most would give positive publicity to the product. The heuristic with the highest score was ease of memorization and participants in the third stage were interested in continuing to use the tool in practice, even after the end of the study. Conclusion: The Agente Escuta prototype showed good usability and satisfaction and aspects that could be improved in future solutions were identified. © (2023). All Rights Reserved.

AB  - With the growing number of researches about air quality indices, it is only imperative to present and disseminate the scientific findings to a broader audience. This includes sharing of charts, maps, digital models, and other relevant information. An effective way to accomplish this is through a Web-based Geographic Information System (WebGIS). This study presents the design and development framework of a WebGIS that enables students, researchers, organizations and the general public to (1) access air quality monitoring stations; (2) explore various geographical factors influencing air quality, such as geographical parameters and proximity to emission sources; and (3) geo-visualize research outputs such as regression models, air dispersion models, and other maps. The methodological framework includes requirement analysis, conceptual design, survey of available hardware and software, database design and construction, acquisition of hardware and software, application development, system integration, and use and maintenance. This paper highlights the Conceptual Design's user-centric approach. User-Centered Design (UCD) encompasses both the User Interface (UI) of the platform and User Experience (UX) during its usage. It guarantees that the user's needs are the main priority of the application. To adhere to the principles of UCD, a mockup of the WebGIS was created using Figma, showcasing its core functionalities. This mockup underwent Usability Testing, a step typically done in multiple iterations to allow for discussions, collection of feedback, and evaluation of the application's functionalities. This is critical as it sets the needs and expectations of the users, ultimately saving development time and resources. The results of the testing were then compiled and assessed to determine their feasibility. It is recommended that WebGIS be developed not only to facilitate the monitoring and analysis of air quality and related integrated data but, more importantly, to play a significant role in encouraging collaboration and public involvement throughout the design and development stages, and also in addressing problems and concerns about air quality for urban planning. © 2023 ACRS.

AB  - Learning to use geographic information system (GIS) software effectively may be intimidating due to the extensive range of features it offers. The GRASS GIS software, in particular, presents additional challenges for first-time users in terms of its complex startup procedure and unique terminology associated with its data structure. On the other hand, a substantial part of the GRASS user community including us as developers recognized and embraced the advantages of the current approach. Given the controversial nature of the whole issue, we decided to actively involve regular users by conducting several formal surveys and by performing usability testing. Throughout this process, we discovered that resolving specific software issues through pure user-centered design is not always feasible, particularly in the context of open-source scientific software where the boundary between users and developers is very fuzzy. To address this challenge, we adopted the user-centered methodology tailored to the requirements of open-source scientific software development, which we refer to as community-driven design. This paper describes the community-driven redesigning process on the GRASS GIS case study and sets a foundation for applying community-driven design in other open-source scientific projects by providing insights into effective software development practices driven by the needs and input of the project’s community. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The complexity of the user interface design of critical healthcare devices may lead to use-related errors. Involving users as co-creators to design simple user interfaces for critical healthcare systems helps reduce user-related errors and, ultimately, lowers the risk to life. The participation of co-creators is effective in reducing the design and process complexity while developing the experimental prototype, which may help reduce cognitive load. A usability evaluation was conducted to assess the users’ perceptions and real experiences with the experimental prototype in actual settings. The participants involved in this study were requested to perform tasks on an experimental prototype and a questionnaire survey was used to gather the participants’ feedback. The results reveal that the interface design increases the user perception of usability by minimizing complexities in design because a strong association between design aspects and system simplicity was observed. The findings provide valuable insight both practically and theoretically to improve the reliability and usability of critical healthcare devices. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Purpose: Supporting the surgeon during surgery is one of the main goals of intelligent ORs. The OR-Pad project aims to optimize the information flow within the perioperative area. A shared information space should enable appropriate preparation and provision of relevant information at any time before, during, and after surgery. Methods: Based on previous work on an interaction concept and system architecture for the sterile OR-Pad system, we designed a user interface for mobile and intraoperative (stationary) use, focusing on the most important functionalities like clear information provision to reduce information overload. The concepts were transferred into a high-fidelity prototype for demonstration purposes. The prototype was evaluated from different perspectives, including a usability study. Results: The prototype’s central element is a timeline displaying all available case information chronologically, like radiological images, labor findings, or notes. This information space can be adapted for individual purposes (e.g., highlighting a tumor, filtering for own material). With the mobile and intraoperative mode of the system, relevant information can be added, preselected, viewed, and extended during the perioperative process. Overall, the evaluation showed good results and confirmed the vision of the information system. Conclusion: The high-fidelity prototype of the information system OR-Pad focuses on supporting the surgeon via a timeline making all available case information accessible before, during, and after surgery. The information space can be personalized to enable targeted support. Further development is reasonable to optimize the approach and address missing or insufficient aspects, like the holding arm and sterility concept or new desired features. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Patients with chronic illnesses with physical and cognitive disabilities, particularly stroke survivors with aphasia, are often not involved in design and evaluation processes. As a consequence, existing eHealth services often do not meet the needs of this group of patients, which has resulted in a digital divide. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness and user satisfaction of an electronic care and rehabilitation planning tool from the perspective of stroke survivors with aphasia. This would help us gain knowledge on how such a tool would need to be adapted for these patients for further development. Methods: Usability tests were conducted with 9 postdischarge stroke survivors with aphasia. Effectiveness was measured using task-based tests, and user satisfaction was studied through qualitative interviews at the end of each test. All tests were audio recorded, and each test lasted approximately 1 hour. The data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. As the tool can be used by stroke survivors either independently or with some support from their next of kin or care professionals, the research group decided to divide the participants into 2 groups. Group 1 did not receive any support during the tests, and group 2 received some minor support from the moderator. Results: The results showed that the care and rehabilitation planning tool was not effective for stroke survivors with aphasia, as many participants in group 1 did not accomplish the tasks successfully. Despite several usability problems and challenges in using the tool because of patients’ disabilities, the participants were positive toward using the tool and found it useful for their care and rehabilitation journey. Conclusions: There is a need to involve patients with chronic illnesses more in the design and evaluation processes of health information systems and eHealth services. eHealth services and health information systems designed for this group of patients should be more adaptable and flexible to provide them with appropriate functionalities and features, meet their needs, and be useful and easy to use. In addition, the design and evaluation processes should be adapted, considering the challenges of this patient group. ©Nadia Davoody, Aboozar Eghdam, Sabine Koch, Maria Hägglund.

AB  - Background: People with Achilles tendinopathy (AT) experience persistent pain that can limit engagement with daily occupations and negatively impact mental health. Current therapeutic exercise approaches vary in success, with many people experiencing reinjury, leading to a cycle of chronic tendinopathy often lasting years. High-magnitude precision loading may help people exit this feedback cycle, but applying these principles clinically is challenging. Objective: This user-centered design case study aims to provide an overview on how the PhysViz (a prototype for a novel remote rehabilitation intervention for AT management) was developed and evaluated following the development phase of the Framework for Accelerated and Systematic Technology-Based Intervention Development and Evaluation Research (FASTER). Methods: The development process engaged a multidisciplinary team comprising people with AT experiences, clinicians, and engineers. It followed the 5 stages within the FASTER development phase: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. The PhysViz development and evaluation were informed by needs assessments, surveys, literature reviews, validation studies, case studies, roundtable discussions, and usability testing (some of which have been published previously). The FASTER systematically guided the integration of evidence-based features and behavior change theory. Results: By using the FASTER and ensuring that the PhysViz system was underpinned by diverse stakeholder needs, this work resulted in the development of a working prototype for both the PhysViz physical exercise tool and the accompanying PhysViz software package (mobile app and web application). A variety of study designs informed user-desired features that were integrated into the PhysViz prototype, including real-time biofeedback in the form of precision load monitoring, customizable exercise programs, and pain tracking. In addition, clinicians can visualize client data longitudinally and make changes to client exercise prescriptions remotely based on objective data. The identified areas for improvement, such as upgrading the user interface and user experience and expanding clinical applications, provide valuable insights for future PhysViz iterations. Further research is warranted to assess the long-term efficacy and feasibility of the PhysViz in diverse clinical settings and its potential to improve AT symptoms. Conclusions: Being one of the first technology development initiatives guided by the FASTER, this study exemplifies a systematic and multidisciplinary approach to creating a remote rehabilitation intervention. By incorporating stakeholder feedback and evidence-based features, the PhysViz addresses key challenges in AT rehabilitation, offering a novel solution for precision loading and therapeutic exercise engagement. Positive feedback from users and clinicians underscores the potential impact of the PhysViz in improving AT management outcomes. The PhysViz serves as a model for technology-based intervention development, with potential implications for other tendinopathies and remote rehabilitation strategies. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - During interpersonal interactions, conversational moves can help people establishcommon ground - -a shared frame of reference to support communication. Neurodiverse conversation dyads that include autistic and non-autistic members can experience challenges in creating and maintaining such a shared frame of reference due to differing communication and cognitive styles. We conducted a design study to understand conversational patterns among neurodiverse dyads and then used those patterns to co-design concepts for supporting the creation and maintenance of common ground by those conversation pairs. Our study involved two activities with participants: (1) a paired interview with autistic adults and a trusted conversation partner that used a novel swimlane visual elicitation activity, and (2) a remote design study during which the autistic participants designed a game intended to visualize and support neurodiverse conversation dynamics. We found that communication technology can scaffold neurodiverse dyads in locating common ground by supporting crucial individual and joint decision-making; clarification of language and emotions; and embodied sense-making of identity, relationships, and shared information. This project generated insights related to two distinct aspects of designing assistive Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to support autistic individuals: (1) the ability for visual elicitation activities to help autistic individuals recognize interaction patterns, gain a deeper understanding of other's perspectives, and imagine more desirable alternatives, and (2) the importance of recognizing and supporting multi-dimensional aspects of communication practices (i.e., social, emotional, sensory) in establishing and maintaining shared points of reference for neurodiverse conversation dyads.  © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - Multi-step retrosynthetic route planning (MRRP) is the core task in synthetic chemistry, in which chemists recursively deconstruct a target molecule to find a set of reactants that make up the target. MRRP is challenging in that the search space is vast, and chemists are often lost in the process. Existing AI models can achieve automatic MRRP fast, but they only work on relatively simple targets, which leaves complex molecules under chemists' expertise. To facilitate MRRP of complex molecules, we proposed a human-AI collaborative system, RetroLens, through a participatory design process. AI can contribute by two approaches: joint action and algorithm-in-the-loop. Deconstruction steps are allocated to chemists or AI based on their capabilities and AI recommends candidate revision steps to fix problems along the way. A within-subjects study (N=18) showed that chemists who used RetroLens reported faster MRRP, broader design space exploration, higher confidence in their planning, and lower cognitive load. © 2023 ACM.

AB  - The Center for eIntegrated Care (CeIC) in Dublin City University is a research centre with a mission to advance eIntegrated care in order to improve citizen health and wellbeing. The core objective of the CeIC is to inform, develop and advance knowledge on integrated care at the national and international level to support eHealth practices, empower citizens and practitioners. This chapter will provide a summary overview using a case study focused on development of an ontology underpinned by a published International Standard ISO 13940 entitled Health Informatics Systems of Concepts for Continuity of Care (Contsys). The development work focuses on semantic interoperability to support service improvement initiatives to inform the development of core infrastructure for shared intellectual disabilities care services. Based on user defined and agreed needs, the authors illustrate phase one of preliminary development work using a dedicated application to support COVID-19 clients in residential care units. This initial work is used to test an emerging conceptual framework underpinned by the state-of-the-art health informatics standards for knowledge discovery and data integration systems. Involving a scholarship group of intellectual disability service staff and users, a co-participatory design approach has been used to conduct the following methodology. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Background: Aging of the global population is slowly paving the way for new markets for care products and services. The desire of older people to maintain their independence while remaining at home is boosting the development of ambient assisted living (AAL) solutions. Lack of user awareness of AAL solutions paired with an insufficient use of user-centered and participatory design approaches in the development of these products has hindered the uptake of these solutions by end users. Objective: This study aims to describe the usability and users’ experiences within a novel platform, ActiveAdvice, aimed at offering advice and a holistic market overview of AAL products and services. Methods: Usability tests were performed on the developed platform among identified prospective end users, with 32 older adults and informal carers from 4 European countries being part of the user tests. The usability and appeal of the web interface design, information flow, and information architecture were analyzed by collecting both objective and subjective measures. These would include pretest and posttest surveys, along with a series of think-aloud tasks to be performed within the platform. Results: The outcomes suggest that the ActiveAdvice platform’s objectives and functionalities are mostly aligned with the needs and expectations of end users, who demonstrated interest in using it, stressing its purpose along with its simple and intuitive interaction. Task completion rates were high, and participants had good satisfaction rates when navigating the platform. However, the tests still advocate for an improved design at some points and better disclosure of information. Conclusions: Our findings shed light on a few peculiarities of interface design, information architecture, user needs, and preferred functionalities, which should be applied to future developments of similar platforms with related services. The AAL field could benefit from tools supporting the dissemination of available AAL solutions and how they can improve one's quality of life. These tools may benefit not only older adults but also caregivers, business owners, and governmental employees. © Diogo Abrantes, Soraia Teles, Rita Tavares de Sousa, Alberto Freitas, Pedro Vieira-Marques, Ana Ferreira.

AB  - In this paper, HCI-based design criteria for the Extended Reality (XR) based training environments. XR is an umbrella term used to describe Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) training environments are presented. The design criteria explored in the paper help lay a foundation for the creation of Human Centric XR environments to train users in an orthopedic surgical procedure. The HCI-based perspective presented in the paper investigates the criteria such as affordance and cognitive load during the design. The paper focuses on the design of XR based environments based on the participatory design approach and information-centric modeling. Further, the paper delineates the implementation of the XR based environments and a set of attributes that guide and influence the content of the environments. Testing and assessment strategy has also been described integrating the design thinking to the assessment and providing insights into the impact of such HCI-based criteria on participants' acquisition of skills and knowledge during interactions with the XR environments. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents the design and implementation of BL.MIXEDR, a maintenance assistance system that leverages the capabilities of augmented reality (AR) to support technicians during maintenance processes. BL.MIXEDR reimagines the work order to fully exploit the contextualization of numerical data and maintenance management information using the hands-free and spatial capabilities of augmented reality headsets. The prototype supports technicians with relevant information, at the right moment and at the right location allowing them to focus solely on the maintenance work, thus, reducing extraneous cognitive load and improving their performances. Moreover, the architecture of the BL.MIXEDR system allows a simplified integration with existing maintenance systems, which, in our view, is one of the barriers to industrial adoption of AR maintenance systems. BL.MIXEDR is the result of several iterations of user-centered design and multiple evaluations by maintenance experts in real conditions on the field.  © 2022 ACM.

AB  - One of the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) characteristics is their difficulty understanding other people’s emotions. Their lack of skill of understanding emotion includes expression and appropriate emotional response for a certain situation. This paper proposes an adapted book that helps therapists and parents guide ASD children to learn facial emotional expression. The adapted book combined with video, animation, and Augmented Reality increases children with ASD at recognizing emotional expression. This research uses User-Centered Design (UCD) approach to design the AR Adapted Book application and design the social story to be observable in school and family environment. Based on usability testing tried on the application, the result shows that AREmotion has an average score of 82.73 percent, and the learnability aspect has the highest score of 86.7 percent. This preliminary usability testing proves that the design of the AREmotion application is ready to use in real implementation for children with ASD. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a study on user experience (UX) design and evaluation of warning systems intended for older adults in semi-autonomous cars. We used combinations of visual, auditory, and speech modalities to design the warning alerts and created three low-fidelity, video-based prototypes. We conducted user tests with elderly drivers, both in the lab and remotely, within a test-and-refine approach involving three experiments. The methods used for data collection included Wizard of Oz, standard questionnaires and interviews. We collected qualitative user feedback and self-reported ratings of user experience and cognitive load. We report on the iterative development of our design solution, findings from these user studies, and our methodological insights, that UX researchers and practitioners could use in similar settings.

AB  - This study aims to design an idea lab or village idea lab as a digital platform An idea lab is defined as an infrastructure developed for gathering in, creating ideas, and brainstorming. The idea lab program adopts the concept of opportunities of learning which focuses on how in learning rather than what. Each group of participants must be able to carry out some activities, namely: defining problems, obtaining data and information, filtering data, expanding initial ideas, and finally applying these ideas (creativity and brainstorming techniques). This study used the User-Centered Design (UCD) method consisting of four stages, namely, (1) understand the context of use, (2) specify user requirements, (3) design solutions, and (4) evaluate. Before developing the platform, the researchers explore the concept of idea lab from empirical and theoretical perspectives. User experience evaluation using the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) and usability testing using the System Usability Scale (SUS). The SUS resulted in a final score of 64, which means in the acceptable category. EOQ test concluded that the user experience of the developed product is quite good. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Type 1 Diabetics must constantly monitor blood glucose levels and carbohydrate intake to maintain health and avoid adverse health consequences. Insulin pump technology has advanced rapidly with the introduction of closed loop systems that match pumps with Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGM), creating networks that simulate the pancreas. The goal of this project was to develop an interface that improves usability when it is not possible to interact directly with the Pump. Survey respondents described a variety of factors that limit this interaction, outlining the opportunity for an improved user interface. Our developmental methodology consisted of; (1) Online survey; (2) Interviews; (3) Participatory Design Workshops, (4) Design of an Improved Insulin Pump and Interface; (5) Validation of this proposed design through Usability Testing. This paper will provide an overview of the research and development process and demonstrate how the proposed concept for an improved interface simplifies user interaction with one’s GCM. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - System recommendation is currently on the rise: more and more e-commerce rely on this feature to give more privilege to their users. However, system recommendation still faces a lot of problems that can lead to its downfall. For instance, the cold start problem and lack of privacy for user's data in system recommendation will make the quality of this system lesser than ever. Moreover, e-commerce also faces another significant issue which is the lack of social presence. Compared to offline shopping, online shopping in e-commerce may be seen as lacking human presence and sociability as it is more impersonal, cold, automated, and generally devoid of face-to-face interactions. Hence, all of those issues mentioned above may lead to the regression of user's trust toward e-commerce itself. This study will focus on solving those problems using conversational design interaction in the form of a Virtual Agent. This Virtual Agent can help e-commerce gather user preferences and give clear and direct information regarding the use of user's data as well as help the user find products, promo, or similar products that they seek in e-commerce. The final result of this solution is a high fidelity prototype designed using User-Centered Design Methodology and Natural Conversational Framework. The implementation of this solution is carried out in Shopee e-commerce by modifying their product recommendation system. This prototype was measured using the usability testing method for usability goals efficient to use and user experience goals helpful.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - An empowered sense of “self” is crucial for emotional well-being and positive relationships. Certain family interaction patterns can disrupt the adult's sense of “mattering” to the child, eroding their perceived self-efficacy. Mattering can be understood as a felt sense of relational agency which is necessary for experiencing one's interactions as meaningful, effective, and self-determined. When parents generate more positive future narratives in co-creation with their therapist, their sense of relevance to a child can be restored. In this way, more constructive forms of interaction can emerge with their child which has hitherto eschewed their care. This article aims to provide a conceptual basis for addressing an absence of reciprocity, where children demonstrate harmful or self-destructive behavior and refuse to cooperate in therapy. In such instances, one-sided parental action, utilizing nonviolent resistance methods, can influence relational dynamics. Imaginary methods can then facilitate shifts to psychological states in which the parent internally experiences efficacy and mattering more often without requiring validation from the “physical child” in the here and now. We introduce examples of specific imaginary techniques, which in our clinical practice have shown to facilitate such shifts in parents. We discuss neuroscientific theories that may account for their powerful impact we witness in our clinical experience. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The increasing use of social media has led to an increase in the spread of hoaxes in Indonesia. To overcome this, there are several anti-hoax applications available for Indonesians. Even though these applications can be accessed freely, the number of usages is still low. People tend not to use it due to the application's poor interaction design, such as difficult to understand, etc. Therefore, the low usage number causing the urgency to solve the application's interaction design. This research aims to create an interaction design for an application that can overcome the users problems to increase the number of usages of the anti-hoax application. User needs and preferences for the anti-hoax application interaction design are determined through research using questionnaire and interview methods. The platform chosen as the solution is a chatbot on the Whatsapp application. The method used to design the anti-hoax chatbot's interaction design is user-centered design, so the focus is on the user needs and problems. This research resulted a high-fidelity prototype that meets the usability goals which are effective to use and easy to learn and the user experience goals which is helpful. The result of the usability testing shows that the interaction design meets the usability goals and user experience goals that has been determined with a completion rate of 100%, SEQ 6.7 out of 7, SUS 87.7 out of 100, CUQ 89 out of 100, and IMI 6.4 out of 7.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The need for objective data-driven usability testing of VR applications is becoming more tangible with the rapid development of numerous VR applications and their increased accessibility. Traditional methods of testing are too time and resource consuming and might provide results that are highly subjective. Thus, the aim of this article is to explore the possibility of automation of usability testing of VR applications by using objective features such as HMD built-in head and hands tracking, EEG sensor, video recording, and other measurable parameters in addition to automated analysis of subjective data provided in questionnaires. For this purpose, a simple VR application was created which comprised relatively easy tasks that did not generate stress for the users. Fourteen volunteers took part in the study and their signals were monitored to acquire objective automated data. At the same time the observer was taking notes of subjects’ behaviour, and their subjective opinions about the experience were recorded in a post-experiment questionnaire. The results acquired from signal monitoring and questionnaires were juxtaposed with observation and post-interview results to confirm the validity and efficacy of automated usability testing. The results were very promising, proving that automated usability testing of VR applications is potentially achievable. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: Closing the gap between care recommended by evidence-based guidelines and care delivered in practice is an ongoing challenge across systems and delivery models. Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) are widely deployed to augment clinicians in their complex decision-making processes. Despite published success stories, the poor usability of many CDSSs has contributed to fragmented workflows and alert fatigue. Objective: This study aimed to validate the application of a user-centered design (UCD) process in the development of a standards-based medication recommender for type 2 diabetes mellitus in a simulated setting. The prototype app was evaluated for effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction. Methods: We conducted interviews with 8 clinical leaders with 8 rounds of iterative user testing with 2-8 prescribers in each round to inform app development. With the resulting prototype app, we conducted a validation study with 43 participants. The participants were assigned to one of two groups and completed a 2-hour remote user testing session. Both groups reviewed mock patient facts and ordered diabetes medications for the patients. The Traditional group used a mock electronic health record (EHR) for the review in Period 1 and used the prototype app in Period 2, while the Tool group used the prototype app during both time periods. The perceived cognitive load associated with task performance during each period was assessed with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index. Participants also completed the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire and Kano Survey. Results: Average SUS scores from the questionnaire, taken at the end of 5 of the 8 user testing sessions, ranged from 68-86. The results of the validation study are as follows: percent adherence to evidence-based guidelines was greater with the use of the prototype app than with the EHR across time periods with the Traditional group (prototype app mean 96.2 vs EHR mean 72.0, P<.001) and between groups during Period 1 (Tool group mean 92.6 vs Traditional group mean 72.0, P<.001). Task completion times did not differ between groups (P=.23), but the Tool group completed medication ordering more quickly in Period 2 (Period 1 mean 130.7 seconds vs Period 2 mean 107.7 seconds, P<.001). Based on an adjusted α level owing to violation of the assumption of homogeneity of variance (Ps>.03), there was no effect on screens viewed and on perceived cognitive load (all Ps>.14). Conclusions: Through deployment of the UCD process, a point-of-care medication recommender app holds promise of improving adherence to evidence-based guidelines; in this case, those from the American Diabetes Association. Task-time performance suggests that with practice the T2DM app may support a more efficient ordering process for providers, and SUS scores indicate provider satisfaction with the app. © Kevin Larsen, Bilikis Akindele, Henry Head, Rick Evans, Purvi Mehta, Quinn Hlatky, Brendan Krause, Sydney Chen, Dominic King.

AB  - Background: Rural local health departments (LHDs) lack adequate capacity and funding to effectively make data-driven decisions to support their communities that face greater health disparities compared to urban counterparts. The need, therefore, exists for informatics solutions to support rural LHDs. Purpose: We describe the user-centered design (UCD) of SHARE-NW: Solutions in Health Analytics for Rural Equity across the Northwest, a website (sharenw.nwcphp.org) with data visualization dashboards for rural LHD practitioners in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington to help them identify health disparities in their jurisdictions. Methods: In this UCD study guided by Munzner's Nested Model for Visualization Design and Validation, we (1) completed a needs assessment, (2) created and evaluated mockups, and (3) conducted usability testing of a functional alpha testing website. Potential end-users (rural LHD practitioners) and Equity Advisory Committee members (public health experts from state, rural local, and tribal public health agencies) across our four-state catchment area were engaged throughout the website development and testing. We adapted traditional in-person UCD methods to be remote to reach participants across a large geographic area and in rural/frontier areas of Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Results: We recruited participants from all four states to engage in each stage of the project. Needs assessment findings informed the mockup development, and findings from the mockup evaluations informed the development of the functional website. Usability testing of the website overall was positive, with priority usability issues identified. Conclusions: By applying Munzner's Nested Model and UCD, we could purposefully and intentionally design evidence-based solutions, specifically for rural LHD practitioners. Adaptations of traditional UCD methods were successful and allowed us to reach end-users across a large geographic area. Future work on SHARE-NW will involve the evaluation of the website. We provide insights on our lessons learned to support future public health informatics solution development. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Maintaining nutrition and exercise strategies after rehabilitation can be difficult for older people with malnutrition or limited mobility. A technical assistance system such as an e-coach could help to positively influence changes in dietary and exercise behavior and contribute to a sustainable improvement in one’s nutrition and mobility status. Most apps do not provide a combination of nutrition and exercise content. In most cases, these apps were evaluated with healthy individuals aged <70 years, making transferability to vulnerable patients, with functional limitations and an assumed lower affinity for technology, in geriatric rehabilitation unlikely. Objective: This study aims to identify the potential for optimization and enhance usability through iterative test phases to develop a nutrition and mobility e-coach suitable for older adults (≥65 years) based on individual health behavior change stages in a rehabilitation setting. Methods: Iterative testing was performed with patients aged ≥65 years in a rehabilitation center. During testing, participants used an e-coach prototype with educational elements and active input options on nutrition and mobility as a 1-time application test. The participants performed navigation and comprehension tasks and subsequently provided feedback on the design aspects. Hints were provided by the study team when required, documented, and used for improvements. After testing, the participants were asked to rate the usability of the prototype using the System Usability Scale (SUS). Results: In all, 3 iterative test phases (T1-T3) were conducted with 49 participants (24/49, 49% female; mean 77.8, SD 6.2 years). Improvements were made after each test phase, such as adding explanatory notes on overview screens or using consistent chart types. The use of the user-centered design in this specific target group facilitated an increase in the average SUS score from 69.3 (SD 16.3; median 65) at T1 to 78.1 (SD 11.8; median 82.5) at T3. Fewer hints were required for navigation tasks (T1: 14.1%; T2: 26.5%; T3: 17.2%) than for comprehension questions (T1: 30.5%; T2: 21.6%; T3: 20%). However, the proportion of unsolved tasks, calculated across all participants in all tasks, was higher for navigation tasks (T1: 0%, T2: 15.2%, T3: 4.3%) than for comprehension tasks (T1: 1.9%, T2: 0%, T3: 2.5%). Conclusions: The extensive addition of explanatory sentences and terms, instead of shorter keywords, to make it easier for users to navigate and comprehend the content was a major adjustment. Thus, good usability (SUS: 80th-84th percentile) was achieved using iterative optimizations within the user-centered design. Long-term usability and any possible effects on nutritional and physical activity behavior need to be evaluated in an additional study in which patients should be able to use the e-coach with increasing independence, thereby helping them to gain access to content that could support their long-term behavior change. © 2022 JMIR Research Protocols..

AB  - In this paper, we present a crossover experiment with a remote usability testing to validate a User Centered Design process applied to a point-of-sale user interfaces redesign, in which the original software product interfaces had a low grade of usability. It was developed as a structured usability remote test plan applied with two samples of users through a crossover experiment. Each sample was composed by 6 participants that had close knowledge about information systems features and other personality attributes obtained by the cashier profile designed through the personas technique. Cashiers are a fundamental role, since they use this software many hours per day, and are very rotative employees, that tend to be young people between 18 and 25 years old. We obtained favorable results, as each sample decreased their execution time in completing the 10 given tasks in more than one minute, which is a valuable time in sales, and it reduced their dependency to ask for help or making operational mistakes in the sale’s process. They emphasized some improved points such as “more understandable labels”, “more striking and pleasant colors”, “better visualization of the components”, and “much easier process to use”. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - Every student has a different learning style. Not all of these learning styles can be facilitated through classroom learning. Mobile learning (m-learning) is the use of mobile technology to support learning activities and facilitate a variety of student learning styles. However, no previous studies of the development of m-learning products have tested the possibility of facilitating different learning styles within a single M-learning application. This study describes the development and evaluation of an adaptive m-learning application that can facilitate the needs of different students. The Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model was used as the reference for learning styles. The prototype application was developed using the user-centered design method, which includes user needs analysis, interaction design, application development, and usability testing. The designers followed the best practices laid out in Shnei-derman's Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design and Gagné's Nine Events of Instruction. A usability test of the prototype involving ten participants. Usability testing is carried out by conducting usability testing and filling out the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire by all participants. The result found that it had good usability. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Current clinical practice relies heavily on technology to support decision-making. In particular, machine learning is increasingly used in decision support systems. This can be attributed to information overload, a fact that clinicians cannot consider all available information. The disadvantage of this method is that this kind of Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) is usually a black box, and it can't understand its decision-making reasons. However, in a healthcare environment, trust and accountability are important issues, and such systems should best be interpretable. In contrast, other areas rely almost entirely on observational or subjective patient reported questionnaires to quantify medical conditions. Developers need to use cognitive science based Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research methods to design practice models, including user-centered iterative design and common standards. The main work of this paper is to propose a clinical decision support model with enhanced interpretability, including an automated interface generation engine. In the design of personalized decision-making, enhance the universality of decision-making push. The clinical evidence is input and displayed in the form of tables, and the medical concepts and their matching with SNOMED CT terms, consistent navigation, and finally displayed in the form of knowledge spectrum. Enhance the flexibility of interaction and integrate workflow seamlessly. As a result, domain experts can get advice quickly and take appropriate actions at convenient points in the workflow without additional effort or delay. Optimizing the interaction and availability of CDSS with providers can enhance the use of CDSS. The iterative design of CDSS improves the usability of the system and the user's popularity score. Our analysis shows that modern machine learning methods can provide interpretability compatible with domain Interpretation Knowledge Base (IKB) and traditional method ranking. Future work should focus on replicating these findings in other datasets and further testing different interpretable methods. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Feedback is essential in a self-regulated learning environment such as medical education. When feedback channels are widely spread, the need arises for a system of integrating this information in a single platform. This article reports on the design and initial testing of a feedback tool for medical students at Charité-Universitätsmedizin, Berlin, a large teaching hospital. Following a needs analysis, we designed and programmed a feedback tool in a user-centered approach. The resulting interface was evaluated prior to release with usability testing and again post release using quantitative/qualitative questionnaires. Results: The tool we created is a browser application for use on desktop or mobile devices. Students log in to see a dashboard of “cards” featuring summaries of assessment results, a portal for the documentation of acquired practical skills, and an overview of their progress along their course. Users see their cohort’s average for each format. Learning analytics rank students’ strengths by subject. The interface is characterized by colourful and simple graphics. In its initial form, the tool has been rated positively overall by students. During testing, the high task completion rate (78%) and low overall number of non-critical errors indicated good usability, while the quantitative data (system usability scoring) also indicates high ease of use. The source code for the tool is open-source and can be adapted by other medical faculties. Conclusions: The results suggest that the implemented tool LevelUp is well-accepted by students. It therefore holds promise for improved, digitalized integrated feedback about students’ learning progress. Our aim is that LevelUp will help medical students to keep track of their study progress and reflect on their skills. Further development will integrate users’ recommendations for additional features as well as optimizing data flow. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Based on the results of a survey on the COMIC application, which was conducted on 33 users with an age range of 20-40 years. There is data, that the User Interface of this application is very irrelevant to the millennial generation. There are several difficulties experienced by millennial employees in using the COMIC application so that there is no match between the needs of the user and the application. The method used in this research is User-Centered Design (UCD). Through this method, the UI/UX in the COMIC application can be redesigned, by positioning millennial employees at Telkom Corporate as the center of research objects in conforming to their needs. This research has specific objectives, namely: eliciting (generating UML artifacts in the form of Requirement Statements, and making Usecase Diagrams), improvements coach booking flow through U secase Diagram modeling supported by the mockup design, and measuring user suitability through Usability Testing. The results of this study are UI development references in the form of Requirement Statements, namely Functional Requirements, improvement of the coach booking flow through Usecase diagrams which have 3 actors and 8 usecases, Re-design mockup, and usability testing measurements that produce each category, namely Effectiveness = 97%, Efficient = 93%, and Satisfaction = 84, 5%. The measurement of these 3 aspects is above average and this application has achieved a conformity between the user and the application. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - As social robots are increasingly entering the real world, developing a viable robot application has become highly important. While a growing body of research has acknowledged that the integration of an agile development methodology with user-centered design (UCD) provides advantages for both organizations and end users, integrating UCD in an agile methodology has been a challenging endeavor. The present paper illustrates a user-centered agile approach that integrates user perspectives through formative usability testing during an agile development process of a robot application and thus differentiates from most robot application evaluations, which conduct summative usability testing (i.e., they quantitatively test goal achievement after technological developments). Through an active involvement of organization and end users, the intermediate results of our ongoing project show that the developed social robot application is both useful and usable. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Background: Familial hypercholesterolemia, a prevalent genetic disorder, remains significantly underdiagnosed in the United States. Cascade testing, wherein individuals diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia— probands—contact their family members to inform them of their risk for familial hypercholesterolemia, has low uptake in the United States. Digital tools are needed to facilitate communication between familial hypercholesterolemia probands and their family members and to promote sharing of familial hypercholesterolemia–related risk information. Objective: We aimed to create and evaluate a web-based tool designed to enhance familial communication and promote cascade testing for familial hypercholesterolemia. Methods: A hybrid type 1 implementation science framework and a user-centered design process were used to develop an interactive web-based tool—FH Family Share—that enables familial hypercholesterolemia probands to communicate information about their familial hypercholesterolemia diagnosis with at-risk relatives. Probands can also use the tool to draw a family pedigree and learn more about familial hypercholesterolemia through education modules and curated knowledge resources. Usability guidelines and standards were taken into account during the design and development of the tool. The initial prototype underwent a cognitive walkthrough, which was followed by usability testing with key stakeholders including genetic counselors and patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. Participants navigated the prototype using the think-aloud technique, and their feedback was used to refine features of the tool. Results: Key themes that emerged from the cognitive walkthrough were design, format, navigation, terminology, instructions, and learnability. Expert feedback from the cognitive walkthrough resulted in a rebuild of the web-based tool to align it with institutional standards. Usability testing with genetic counselors and patients with familial hypercholesterolemia provided insights on user experience, satisfaction and interface design and highlighted specific modifications that were made to refine the features of FH Family Share. Genetic counselors and patients with familial hypercholesterolemia suggested inclusion of the following features in the web-based tool: (1) a letter-to-family-member email template, (2) education modules, and (3) knowledge resources. Surveys revealed that 6 of 9 (67%) genetic counselors found information within FH Family Share very easy to find, and 5 of 9 (56%) genetic counselors found information very easy to understand; 5 of 9 (56%) patients found information very easy to find within the website, and 7 of 9 (78%) patients found information very easy to understand. All genetic counselors and patients indicated that FH Family Share was a resource worth returning to. Conclusions: FH Family Share facilitates communication between probands and their relatives. Once informed, at-risk family members have the option to seek testing and treatment for familial hypercholesterolemia. © Hana Bangash, Ahmed Makkawy, Justin H Gundelach, Alexandra A Miller, Kimberly A Jacobson, Iftikhar J Kullo.

AB  - Background: Despite growing evidence that deprescribing can improve clinical outcomes, quality of life and reduce the likelihood of adverse drug events, the practice is not widespread, particularly in hospital settings. Clinical risk assessment tools, like the Drug Burden Index (DBI), can help prioritise patients for medication review and prioritise medications to deprescribe, but are not integrated within routine care. The aim of this study was to conduct formative usability testing of a computerised decision support (CDS) tool, based on DBI, to identify modifications required to the tool prior to trialling in practice. Methods: Our CDS tool comprised a DBI MPage in the electronic medical record (clinical workspace) that facilitated review of a patient’s DBI and medication list, access to deprescribing resources, and the ability to deprescribe. Two rounds of scenario-based formative usability testing with think-aloud protocol were used. Seventeen end-users participated in the testing, including junior and senior doctors, and pharmacists. Results: Participants expressed positive views about the DBI CDS tool but testing revealed a number of clear areas for improvement. These primarily related to terminology used (i.e. what is a DBI and how is it calculated?), and consistency of functionality and display. A key finding was that users wanted the CDS tool to look and function in a similar way to other decision support tools in the electronic medical record. Modifications were made to the CDS tool in response to user feedback. Conclusion: Usability testing proved extremely useful for identifying components of our CDS tool that were confusing, difficult to locate or to understand. We recommend usability testing be adopted prior to implementation of any digital health intervention. We hope our revised CDS tool equips clinicians with the knowledge and confidence to consider discontinuation of inappropriate medications in routine care of hospitalised patients. In the next phase of our project, we plan to pilot test the tool in practice to evaluate its uptake and effectiveness in supporting deprescribing in routine hospital care. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The Gamers4Nature (G4N) project aims to promote environmental awareness through the creation of digital games addressing that theme. The G4N Toolkit to Game design, developed within the project, is an artifact that encompasses resources to support the game creation process and sets of environmental-related thematic cards. In order to be used by other entities (e.g. Environmental Organizations), there was the need to develop a digital design tool able to be used by anyone who wishes to create thematic cards sets, while complying with the design principles and G4N brand guidelines. This paper introduces the G4N Cards Set canvas, a digital tool designed to allow users to produce their own customized thematic cards. The tool was iteratively evaluated by teachers and UX design experts (N = 13). Results emphasize the tool’s intuitiveness, its impact in reducing the user’s learning curve and cognitive load, and its usefulness and practicality in several contexts. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to transition our user-centered research and design activities in the emergency medical domain of trauma resuscitation from in-person settings to online environments. This transition required that we replicate the in-person interactions remotely while maintaining the critical social connection and the exchange of ideas with medical providers. In this paper, we describe how we designed and conducted four user-centered design activities from our homes: participatory design workshops, near-live simulation sessions, usability evaluation sessions, and interviews and design walkthroughs. We discuss the differences we observed in our interactions with participants in remote sessions, as well as the differences in the interactions among the research team members. From this experience, we draw several lessons and outline the best practices for remotely conducting user-centered design activities that have been traditionally held in person. © 2021 Owner/Author.

AB  - With life expectancy growing rapidly over the past century, societies are being increasingly faced with a need to find smart living solutions for elderly care and active ageing. The e-VITA project, which is a joint European (H2020) and Japanese (MIC) funded project, is based on an innovative approach to virtual coaching that addresses the crucial domains of active and healthy ageing. In this paper we describe the role of spoken dialogue technology in the project. Requirements for the virtual coach were elicited through a process of participatory design in workshops, focus groups, and living labs, and a number of use cases were identified for development using the open-source RASA framework. Knowledge Graphs are used as a shared representation within the system, enabling an integration of multimodal data, context, and domain knowledge. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - digital eye strain is a combination of eye or vision problems associated with the use of digital screens. In addition, DES can reduce productivity and quality of life. Basically, DES is caused by the high intensity use of digital screens. Since the spread of COVID-19 increased in Indonesia, the duration of using digital screens has increased dramatically, which increases the risk of DES. Currently, there are many eye health apps in the community. However, existing apps still cannot meet their goals and needs, especially helping to maintain their motivation for eye health. Therefore, BetterEyes is designed with a user-centered design approach with gamification to keep them motivated. Survey research and user interviews were conducted to understand their behavior and problems. Usability testing are conducted in each iteration to evaluate the usability goals (effective to use and easy to learn) and user experience goals (motivating). The results in the last iteration showed the prototype designed was effective (100% completion rate), easy to learn (SEQ score 6.7 out of 7), and motivating (IMI score 6.09 out of 7). In addition, the overall usability aspect of the prototype is also categorized in the acceptable with an A score (SUS score 97.5 out of 100). Based on these results, it can be concluded that the designs are able to meet the goals and needs of the users in protecting their eyes from DES. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Health information technologies (HIT) can support care and coordination of pediatric trauma patients. This study adapted to a remote usability study protocol to test a HIT prototype that was designed using a participatory design process. The participants were mostly successful interacting with the prototype and were able to locate and understand necessary information. Several design and interaction issues were identified. The tests provided valuable feedback about the prototype’s design that will inform the final prototype for testing in a team-centric in situ setting when it is safe to do so. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of heart failure (HF) is increasing in Uganda. Ugandan patients with HF report receiving limited information about their illness and associated self-care behaviours. Interventions targeted at improving HF self-care have been shown to improve patient quality of life and reduce hospitalizations in high-income countries. However, such interventions remain underutilized in resource-limited settings like Uganda. This study aimed to develop a digital health intervention that enables improved self-care amongst HF patients in Uganda. Methods: We implemented a user-centred design (UCD) process to develop a self-care intervention entitled Medly Uganda. The ideation phase comprised a scoping review and preliminary data collection amongst HF patients and clinicians in Uganda. An iterative design process was then used to advance an initial prototype into a functional digital health intervention. The evaluation phase involved usability testing of the intervention amongst Ugandan patients with HF and their clinicians. Results: Medly Uganda is a digital health intervention that allows patients to report daily HF symptoms, receive tailored treatment advice and connect with a clinician when showing signs of decompensation. The system harnesses Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) technology that is already widely used in Uganda for mobile phone-based financial transactions. Usability testing showed Medly Uganda to be both acceptable and feasible amongst clinicians, patients and caregivers. Conclusions: Medly Uganda is a functional digital health intervention with demonstrated acceptability and feasibility in enabling Ugandan HF patients to better care for themselves. We are hopeful that the system will improve self-care efficacy amongst HF patients in Uganda. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - A large-volume infusion pump is a medical device with a big job: infuse patients with life-sustaining fluids and medications at a known and controlled rate. And, do it safely. Because infusions are frequently administered therapies, the opportunity for use error–induced adverse events is amplified. To develop a safer infusion pump, Ivenix, Inc., committed to a comprehensive usability engineering effort that included over 400 hours of usability testing. As a result, the pump’s design includes risk controls for mitigating potential use errors not available on today’s pumps. The resulting product was the winner of the 2019 Stanley Caplan User-Centered Design Award. © 2020 by The Author(s).

AB  - This paper presents the design and preliminary evaluation of an Accessible Digital Musical Instrument (ADMI) in the form of a tangible wooden step sequencer that uses photoresistors and wooden blocks to trigger musical events. Furthermore, the paper presents a short overview of design criteria for ADMIs based on literature and first insights of an ongoing qualitative interview study with German Special Educational Needs (SEN) teachers conducted by the first author. The preliminary evaluation is realized by a reflection on the mentioned criteria. The instrument was designed as a starting point for a participatory design process in music education settings. The software is programmed in Pure Data and running on a Raspberry Pi computer that fits inside the body of the instrument. While most similar developments focus on professional performance and complex interactions, LoopBlocks focuses on accessibility and Special Educational Needs settings. The main goal is to reduce the cognitive load needed to play music by providing a clear and constrained interaction, thus reducing intellectual and technical barriers to active music making. © 2021, Steering Committee of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression.

AB  - The marketplace is an e-business model that deals with sellers and buyers. In the agricultural sector, the market acts as a direct link between farmers and consumers. So that it can increase and benefit Indonesian farmers. The total users of the agricultural market currently only reach 100,000 users, which is very different from the total users of other general markets which have reached 50 million users. One of the reasons is that 60% of the time is wasted because many users have not yet obtained the information they are looking for. This has an impact on decreasing productivity until it fails. This study will design an agricultural marketplace application design with a User-Centered Design (UCD) approach. This method is a cycle stage starting from production to market applications by implementing quality market services. This production stage is carried out to become a measuring tool for marketplace design to match the standards set and made by the specifications of user requirements. Then the prototype design stage is carried out with a sketch, a wireframe, and the results of this design are implemented into a medium-fidelity prototype. In the evaluation stage of the medium-fidelity prototype, usability testing was carried out using the think-Aloud method and the performance results were obtained with a success rate of 77.14%. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Financial literacy is knowledge of financial concepts and risks, as well as skills in making effective decisions in various financial contexts. Adolescents have a low level of financial literacy, even though financial literacy is important for adolescents to reach maturity. In Indonesia, the level of financial literacy of adults is also low, even though most teenagers depend on their relatives, especially their parents, as a source of their financial knowledge. Therefore, we need a solution that allows teenagers to get additional financial literacy. The solution built is an interaction design for adolescent financial literacy applications with a user-centered design (UCD) approach based on International Organization of Standardization (ISO) 9241210: 2010 accompanied by gamification. The limitation taken in this project is the application of financial literacy on a mobile platform with a target user of junior high and senior high school students. The end result of the solution is a high-fidelity prototype. Based on the user research conducted, the appropriate usability goals for this application are effective to use and easy to learn, while the appropriate user experience goals are motivating. Based on usability testing, the application succeeded in achieving effective to use with a completion rate of 100% and easy to learn with a Single Ease Question (SEQ) value of 6.76 out of 7. The application also has good usability based on the System Usability Scale (SUS) value of 88.33 out of 100. Meanwhile, the application succeeded in achieving motivating with an Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) value of the interest/enjoyment subscale of 6.33 out of 7 and the value/usefulness subscale of 6.57 out of 7.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - The spatial data infrastructure literature reveals significant gaps in metadata systems concerning their efficiency and effectiveness for end-users. The literature proposes improvements to make the metadata systems more user-friendly. These improvements include new metadata elements and user interfaces that are in concert with each other. In this paper, we implement the proposed improvements in a prototype system and engage with end-users to assess if the proposals help users’ expectations. The prototype is evaluated by conducting think-aloud protocol (TAP) usability testing and semi-structured interviews with end-users. The result demonstrates an increased level of satisfaction about existing systems and some more areas to improve. We conclude that a synchronised development approach for the spatial metadata and the user interface will increase the usability of the metadata for data discovery and selection. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Underprivileged people do not get enough donations in the form of cash, food, clothes, or electronic items, as people are not much aware of the problems faced by underprivileged. Below Poverty Line is a benchmark used by the government of India to indicate very low economic status. Requirement of donation for underprivileged as perception and influence from others are the variable that influences people to donate online. Further people seek for the impact they have made on organization after the donation. Preferably, fund raising, need assistance, notifications regarding the impact donors have made, go live, etc., are some of the features of this web application. The objective of the study is to design user interfaces (UIs) of the web application and human centric validation of it. In the current study, two design concepts of a web application were developed considering the user problems identified through user interviews and survey. Then its prototype was created on Adobe XD and usability testing was conducted. It has been observed that the user interface version 2 of the web application was quite favorable to solve the problems faced by donation seeking organizations as well as donors as the flow of the application is acceptable and users can make donation easily to any organization on a single platform. Therefore, it has been concluded that this donation web portal might be useful to provide a good platform to people willing to make donations online. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Education on asthma self-management has been proven to be effective in improving the level of its control, and quality of life. However, not all asthmatics were interested learning the management due to lazy to read printed sources, such as books. Many studies have confirmed that the use of smartphone apps seems to be a promising education medium. Therefore, this study was aimed at building an OS Google Android-based asthma self-management educational content, according to the control guideline by Indonesian Ministry of Health through Decree No.1023/Menkes/SK/XI/2008. A patient-centered design approach was used, and it consists of five steps including: user needs assessment, initial design, and development of prototype, usability testing, and final product launch. The results showed that participants wanted an educational content of text and audio formats. In the terms of user interface design, they expected that the front page was a list of thumbnails having short and complete descriptions in the text-and video- based single pages respectively. The success rates of the content were confirmed by the usability-testing study as follows: 90% was categorized as completed with ease, 10% was completed with difficulty, and 0% was failed. Applying the approach was successfully completed for building an asthma self-management educational content. A further study regarding its implementation in the clinical world is needed, to prove its effectiveness in improving the level of asthma knowledge.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Digital health research encompasses methods from human-computer interaction and health research. Objective: This paper aims to describe how these methods were combined to develop HeLP-Diabetes: Starting Out, a web-based structured education program for people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Methods: The development process consisted of three phases: initial design for effectiveness, optimization for usability, and in the wild testing in the National Health Service with people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and further revisions. We adopted an iterative user-centered approach and followed steps from the human-computer interaction design life cycle and the Medical Research Council guidelines on developing and evaluating complex interventions. Results: The initial design process resulted in an 8-session program containing information and behavior change techniques targeting weight loss, being more active, and taking medication. The usability testing was highlighted at an early stage, where changes needed to be made to the language and layout of the program. The in the wild testing provided data on uptake of and barriers to use. The study suggested low uptake and completion of the program, but those who used it seemed to benefit from it. The qualitative findings suggested that barriers to use included an expectation that the program would take too long. This informed refinements to the program. Conclusions: The use of interdisciplinary methods resulted in an iterative development process and refinements to the program that were based on user needs and data on uptake. The final intervention was more suitable for a definitive evaluation than the initial version. The description of our approach informs other digital health researchers on how to make interventions more sensitive to user needs. © Shoba Poduval, Jamie Ross, Kingshuk Pal, Nikki Newhouse, Fiona Hamilton, Elizabeth Murray.

AB  - Background: Continuous monitoring of vital signs is critical for ensuring patient safety in intensive care units (ICUs) and is becoming increasingly relevant in general wards. The effectiveness of health information technologies such as patient-monitoring systems is highly determined by usability, the lack of which can ultimately compromise patient safety. Usability problems can be identified and prevented by involving users (ie, clinicians). Objective: In this study, we aim to apply a human-centered design approach to evaluate the usability of a remote patient-monitoring system user interface (UI) in the ICU context and conceptualize and evaluate design changes. Methods: Following institutional review board approval (EA1/031/18), a formative evaluation of the monitoring UI was performed. Simulated use tests with think-aloud protocols were conducted with ICU staff (n=5), and the resulting qualitative data were analyzed using a deductive analytic approach. On the basis of the identified usability problems, we conceptualized informed design changes and applied them to develop an improved prototype of the monitoring UI. Comparing the UIs, we evaluated perceived usability using the System Usability Scale, performance efficiency with the normative path deviation, and effectiveness by measuring the task completion rate (n=5). Measures were tested for statistical significance using a 2-sample t test, Poisson regression with a generalized linear mixed-effects model, and the N-1 chi-square test. P<.05 were considered significant. Results: We found 37 individual usability problems specific to monitoring UI, which could be assigned to six subcodes: usefulness of the system, response time, responsiveness, meaning of labels, function of UI elements, and navigation. Among user ideas and requirements for the UI were high usability, customizability, and the provision of audible alarm notifications. Changes in graphics and design were proposed to allow for better navigation, information retrieval, and spatial orientation. The UI was revised by creating a prototype with a more responsive design and changes regarding labeling and UI elements. Statistical analysis showed that perceived usability improved significantly (System Usability Scale design A: mean 68.5, SD 11.26, n=5; design B: mean 89, SD 4.87, n=5; P=.003), as did performance efficiency (normative path deviation design A: mean 8.8, SD 5.26, n=5; design B: mean 3.2, SD 3.03, n=5; P=.001), and effectiveness (design A: 18 trials, failed 7, 39% times, passed 11, 61% times; design B: 20 trials, failed 0 times, passed 20 times; P=.002). Conclusions: Usability testing with think-aloud protocols led to a patient-monitoring UI with significantly improved usability, performance, and effectiveness. In the ICU work environment, difficult-to-use technology may result in detrimental outcomes for staff and patients. Technical devices should be designed to support efficient and effective work processes. Our results suggest that this can be achieved by applying basic human-centered design methods and principles. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc.. All right reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early mobilization is important to improve critically ill patients' outcomes, but barriers to its implementation are common. A suitable in-bed device to exercise patients' legs might facilitate early mobilization. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop an in-bed leg press that would facilitate early mobilization and enhance strength training of patients in acute care settings. METHODS: A user-centered design approach was applied to develop the device. The process was assessed by different instruments: the system usability scale (SUS) questionnaire, the Kano model questionnaire and interviews with end-users. RESULTS: Through several iterations of a user-centered design process, the prototype of an in-bed leg press was developed and tested. The assessment, based on SUS, Kano and interviews, indicates high usability and demonstrates the advantages of a user-centered design process. CONCLUSIONS: An interprofessional user-centered design approach was successfully implemented to develop a medical device. The early involvement of end-users resulted in a design that already shows a high degree of production readiness. The resulting device fulfilled all core requirements from a therapeutic point of view and included key features related to its practical use.  © 2022 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Akuntabilitas Kinerja Pemerintah (AKP) Application is a website-based application that functions to collect, manage, measure, report, and store all reports of work in Kemenko Marves. The purpose of developing the AKP application is to centralize the mechanism for reporting work results with the same reporting standards. The AKP application interface to be built uses the User Centered Design (UCD) method. The AKP application interface will then carry out testing to find usability problems in the initial AKP application prototype. The AKP application testing in this study was carried out in two iterations. The first iteration test was carried out using the Cognitive Walkthrough and Heuristic Evaluation methods from the expert's point of view and the Think Aloud method from the end user side. While the second iteration test, only uses the Think Aloud method. After conducting usability testing, a final high-fidelity prototype of the AKP application will be built. Based on the results of the final prototype, usability testing was carried out using the SUS questionnaire to re-measure the usability level of the AKP application prototype. The target score for the usability value that is expected from this research is 80 (Grade Scale B). Before making improvements to the initial design of the AKP application, the SUS score was 79.5 (Grade Scale = C). However, after improvements were made to the AKP application design, the SUS score became 84 (Grade Scale = B). Based on the test results, the usability score increased by 4.5 and has reached the research target. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Halal tourism is a new phenomenon that has emerged due to the halal industry's rapid expansion, in 2021 expected to reach a value of 243 billion by 2021. In 2019, Global Muslim Travel Index (GMTI) reported that a Muslim-based platform is needed to support halal tourism services as one of the most critical aspects of halal tourism. One of the platforms available to support halal tourism in Indonesia is the HalalTrip application. The HalalTrip application is one of the Muslim-based applications with the highest number of users but less visible on the usage and has a low rating. To improve HalalTrip application performance, it is necessary to evaluate and improve the application. This research focused on redesigning the HalalTrip application user interface according to user needs and expectations. The evaluation process uses a quantitative method with a User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) and open-ended questions. The user-centered design is used as an approach to redesign the user interface. The results of the redesigned user interface state that there is an increase in every aspect of UEQ and obtained a success rate value of 92% on the usability testing results.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - A Club management system is a centralized management and communications platform for clubs and societies. It is developed as a social innovation which aims to combat the limitations of current systems utilized by clubs, whereby there is no central repository for information, and each club utilizes their own methods for management, member communication, and event organization. A greater attention had been considered to Kanban as an agile software development method in developing such a management system. However, the adoption of this methodology is quite challenging to incorporate user experience and usability in an agile process. Hence, this study utilized the Kanban approach which is an implementation of Lean methodology to manage the software life cycle in developing a university club management system. The user requirements have been identified and documented in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) along with the use case diagram and entity relationship diagram for the database definition. The software was developed using the Laravel PHP Framework. Functional testing and usability testing have been carried out to validate the user requirement. The result of usability testing shows that the system satisfies five usability factors. This will spark some new insights in the use of its technologies and methods for future research.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - People increasingly view mobility as a service and want more choices for traveling between points A and B. Designing user experiences of future robo-taxi needs to be seen from a broad perspective and consider an extended user journey. Our work explores the application of quick and dirty prototyping and usability testing to design UX of future robo-taxi services from the ground up. We made low-fidelity prototypes early in the design process and quickly tested with users iteratively to answer initial questions arisen on critical touchpoints in the user journey. Two critical touchpoints are rider-driverless car match and in-car environment configuration. Five optional eHMI (external HMI) were tested, and our results suggest combining options depending on the distance between the vehicle and the passenger. We also tested two environment templates and found that preference depends on travel time regardless of the purpose of the journey. Finally, we suggest a service scenario composed of 14 scenes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Objective: It is common for employees to complain of muscle fatigue when resting in a reclined position in an office chair. To investigate the physical factors that influence resting comfort in a supine position, a newly designed product was used as the basis for creating a prototype experiment and testing its efficacy in use. Subjective questionnaires were combined with surface EMG measurements and deep learning algorithms were used to identify body part comfort to create a hybrid approach to product usability testing. Methods: To facilitate the use of sEMG-based CNNs in human factors engineering, a subjective user assessment was first conducted using a combination of body mapping and an impact comfort scale to the screen which body parts have a significant impact effect on comfort when using the prototype. A control group (no used) and an experimental group (used) were then created and the body parts with the most significant effects were measured using sEMG methods. After pre-processing the sEMG signal, sMEG feature maps were obtained by mean power frequency (MPF) and linear regression was used to analyze the comforting effect. Finally, a CNN model is constructed and the sMEG feature maps are trained and tested. Results: The results of the experiment showed that the user's subjective assessment showed that 10 body parts had a significant effect on comfort, with the right and left sides of the neck having the highest effect on comfort (4.78). sEMG measurements were then performed on the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) of the left and right neck. Linear analysis of the measurements showed that the control group had higher SCM fatigue than the experimental group, which could also indicate that the experimental group had better comfort. The final CNN model was able to accurately classify the four datasets with an accuracy of 0.99. Conclusion: The results of the study show that the method is effective for the study of physical comfort in the supine sitting position and that it can be used to validate the comfort of similar products and to design iterations of the prototype. © 2022

AB  - In order to make the Semantic Web reach "real world" end-users it is important to consider Semantic Web usability. User-Centered Design from the Human-Computer Interaction community might help in this respect. First of all, the user must be defined, together with the context. Then it is possible to study user tasks. We focus our study of Semantic Web user tasks in endusers and Semantic Web online applications, trying to contribute to establishing some UCD guidelines that help the adoption of Semantic Web applications. However, we consider existing analysis for Web systems and even online information systems in general in order to avoid constraining our view to the current state of development of the Se-mantic Web. The proposed set of end-user Semantic Web tasks is Search, Browse, Annotate, Mashup, Map, Share, Communicate and Transact. They are used in order to study an existing Semantic Web platform and an application based on it. This allows putting the tasks into practice and relates them to some interaction patterns. Future work continues in this line, trying to connect the identified patterns with existing and new interaction pat-terns in order to contribute additional guidelines for UCD Semantic Web applications development. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

AB  - In this paper, the correlation between social capital and innovation performance is analyzed using a knowledge graph approach, and a correlation analysis model is designed for practical use. Given the advantages of knowledge graph technology and the fact that most recommendation models fail to make full use of the correlation between knowledge graph and recommended items, this paper proposes a cross-attention fusion-based knowledge graph recommendation algorithm (CAKR). The CAKR model contains a cross-fusion module, a recommendation task module, and a knowledge graph embedding task module, and the inputs of the two task modules are alternately learned in a low-dimensional space by the cross-fusion module. The input of the two task modules is alternately learned in the low-dimensional space by the cross-fusion module to interact with the two embedding vectors of items and entities, and then, the obtained feature vectors are fed into the relevant task modules, respectively, and then, the results are calculated by the respective prediction functions. There is a mediating role of knowledge management capabilities in the innovation ecology perspective between social capital and innovation performance of SMEs. Among them, it fully mediates the relationship dimension of technical social capital, the cognitive dimension of institutional social capital, the relationship and cognitive dimension of market-based social capital, and innovation performance, and partially mediates the structural and cognitive dimension of technical social capital, the structural and relationship dimension of institutional social capital, and innovation performance. The relationship between knowledge management capability and innovation performance is positively mediated by environmental dynamics in the innovation ecology perspective, and the positive effect of knowledge management capability on innovation performance is more significant when the environmental dynamics are stronger, and vice versa. Finally, based on the results of the empirical study, some management suggestions are provided on how SMEs can reasonably utilize social capital to enhance their innovation performance. © 2022 Yuanyi Ding.

AB  - This study aims to assess the perspectives and usability of different consumer sleep technologies (CSTs) that leverage artificial intelligence (AI). We answer the following research questions: (1) what are user perceptions and ideations of CSTs (phase 1), (2) what are the users’ actual experiences with CSTs (phase 2), (3) and what are the design recommendations from participants (phases 1 and 2)? In this two-phase qualitative study, we conducted focus groups and usability testing to describe user ideations of desires and experiences with different AI sleep technologies and identify ways to improve the technologies. Results showed that focus group participants prioritized comfort, actionable feedback, and ease of use. Participants desired customized suggestions about their habitual sleeping environments and were interested in CSTs+AI that could integrate with tools and CSTs they already use. Usability study participants felt CSTs+AI provided an accurate picture of the quantity and quality of sleep. Participants identified room for improvement in usability, accuracy, and design of the technologies. We conclude that CSTs can be a valuable, affordable, and convenient tool for people who have issues or concerns with sleep and want more information. They provide objective data that can be discussed with clinicians. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Laws are formed by having a purpose, one of which is to obtain legal certainty in which legal awareness of the public become necessary. Several attempt to increase legal literacy is carried out through socialization, one of them in the form of an electronic consultation application on criminal law in Indonesia. Although there are several applications that present the legal case and information, there has not been much impact towards the primary intention and goal due to its offered features are still lacking related to how users utilize the application or called UX (User Experience). In this study, the design of an application is using the UX approach with the UCD (User Centered Design) method, then testing is conducted by usability evaluation. Among 3 (three) kind of designs using usability testing through scenario analysis resulted to the last design as the best alternative because it has the lowest severity of the problem. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Background: Hospitalized people with unhealthy substance use should be referred to treatment. Although inpatient referral resources are often available, clinicians report that outpatient referral networks are not well-established. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe the development and usability testing of a web-based Referral to Treatment Tool (RTT © 2020 Trustees of Indiana University, all rights reserved) designed to identify treatment centers for people with unhealthy substance use. Results: The RTT was conceptualized, developed, and then populated with public use and local survey data of treatment centers from 14 market ZIP codes of hospitals participating in an SBIRT implementation study. The tool underwent initial heuristic testing, followed by usability testing at three hospitals within a large healthcare system in the Midwest region of the United States. Administrative (n = 6) and provider (n = 12) users of the RTT completed a list of tasks and provided feedback through Think-Aloud Tests, the System Usability Scale, and in-person interviews. Patients (n = 4) assessed multiple versions of a take-home printout of referral sites that met their specifications and completed in-person interviews to provide feedback. Each administrative task was completed in less than 3 min, and providers took an average of 4 min and 3 s to identify appropriate referral sites for a patient and print a referral list for the patient. The mean System Usability Scale score (M = 77.22, SD = 15.57, p = 0.03) was significantly higher than the passable score of 70, indicating favorable perceptions of the usability of the RTT. Administrative and provider users felt that the RTT was useful and easy to use, but the settings and search features could be refined. Patients indicated that the printouts contained useful information and that it was helpful to include multiple referral sites on the printout. Conclusion: The web-based referral tool has the potential to facilitate voluntary outpatient referral to treatment for patients with unhealthy substance use. The RTT can be customized for a variety of health care settings and patient needs. Additional revisions based on usability testing results are needed to prepare for a broader multi-site clinical evaluation. Trial Registration Not applicable. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Falls are a prevalent and serious health concern across clinical populations. A critical step in falls prevention is identifying modifiable risk factors, but due to time constraints and equipment costs, fall risk screening is rarely performed. Mobile technology offers an innovative approach to provide personalized fall risk screening for clinical populations. To inform future development, this manuscript discusses the development and testing of mobile health fall risk applications for three unique clinical populations [older adults, individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and wheeled-device users]. We focus on key lessons learned and future directions to improve the field of fall risk mHealth. During the development phase, we first identified fall risk factors specific to each population that are measurable with mobile technology. Second, we determined whether inertial measurement units within smartphones can measure postural control within the target population. Last, we developed the interface of each app with a user-centered design approach with usability testing through iterative semi-structured interviews. We then tested our apps in real-world settings. Our cumulative work demonstrates that mobile technology can be leveraged to provide personalized fall risk screening for different clinical populations. Fall risk apps should be designed and tailored for the targeted group to enhance usefulness and feasibility. In addition, fall risk factors measured with mobile technology should include those that are specific to the population, are measurable with mobile technology, and can accurately measure fall risk. Future work should improve fall risk algorithms and implement mobile technology into fall prevention programs. Copyright © 2022 Hsieh, Frechette, Fanning, Chen, Griffin and Sosnoff.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) offers potential as a collaborative tool for both technology design and human-robot interaction. We utilized a participatory, human-centered design (HCD) methodology to develop a collaborative, asymmetric VR game to explore teens’ perceptions of, and interactions with, social robots. Our paper illustrates three stages of our design process; ideation, prototyping, and usability testing with users. Through these stages we identified important design requirements for our mid-fidelity environment. We then describe findings from our pilot test of the mid-fidelity VR game with teens. Due to the unique asymmetric virtual reality design, we observed successful collaborations, and interesting collaboration styles across teens. This study highlights the potential for asymmetric VR as a collaborative design tool as well as an appropriate medium for successful teen-to-teen collaboration.

AB  - With the growing population of older adults, the need for mHealth to address specific aging features is also increasing. However, various research and usability studies on those mHealth applications indicate that mHealth is still not planned with older adults and their needs in mind. It is critical to gain insight into aging obstacles that affect the usability of mHealth as encountered by older adults in order to improve mHealth designs targeted at this demographic. Voice as a new interaction modality has been heavily emphasized in recent product launches such as Apple's Siri and Google's Voice Search. A user-centered design methodology was used to create a mobile health application to help independent living older adults keep track of their health and routine in this research. To help these individuals, I have designed CORE-Energy, a conceptual context-aware assistive application by integrating a language-technology-driven interface into mHealth. First, a Survey on mHealth was conducted to gather the opinion of various stakeholders. The functional design criteria used to direct the design were identified through an analysis of the data collected during this process. Integration of VUI, keeping track of Blood pressure, blood sugar, body temperature, and fitness tracking functionality was explored using a rapid prototyping method. The ease of use and perceived usefulness of the final prototype produced in this study were assessed. After conducting usability testing on 5 users, this application received a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 75.4%, which indicates that the interface was found to be user-friendly in general. The application created during the research work can be extended to create a more diversified set of voice input to make the user experience even smoother. © MCCSIS 2021.All right reserved.

AB  - The societal and economic impacts of people living with dementia are significant. A possibility to mitigate these impacts are to support their independence at home through cognitive orthosis. Mixed-reality headsets are an emerging technology that come with technological benefits that could be useful in this context. The objective of this research is to propose a first design for a mixed-reality headset cognitive orthosis software to support independence at home of this population. The software architecture is defined as part of a user centred design methodology. The software has been developed during six iterations, each concluded by expert or cognitive walkthrough evaluations, with eight sessions in total. The software has been designed around the following five concepts: (1) finite state machine; (2) transitions between assistances; (3) assistances; (4) interaction surfaces; (5) scenarios. Five themes emerged from the evaluations: (1) gradation; (2) give the control to the user; (3) attract the user's attention; (4) discoverability; (5) interactions. Several opportunities of development are discussed, including usability testing with the population.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - A special strain of situational impairment, termed “Severely Constraining Situational Impairments” (SCSI), was explored from a novel qualitative perspective. When a severely impairing event presents, the multitude and complexity of ambient agents are often overwhelming, leading to the inability to devise a solution. To classify and help design for them, interviews and participatory design-based workshops were conducted, revealing that (1) participants attempt to complete mobile transactions, even if it might place them in considerable danger, and (2) significant differences exist in the modalities and steps used to address the onset of a severely impairing event versus those of a non-severe situational impairment. Design solutions generated from the workshops indicated that users want technology to take a larger role in helping manage the added cognitive load inherent in severely impairing events. The revealed implications for design indicate that to maximize the user experience in the mobile device transaction space, designers must account for the presence of these SCSI and the unique design specifications that they require. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The research on predicting value co-creation through the linear trend equation model of publication volume will continue to grow in the future. Based on the knowledge graph theory, using Cite space software, using the core journals and CSSCI journals in CNKI as data sources, by drawing keyword co-occurrence knowledge graphs and analyzing emergent words, it is identified time scenarios, research hot-spots and future development trends of "value co-creation"evolution. It is found that: "value co-creation"fits the background of China's economic development; service-dominant logic, the Internet, evolutionary games, and cross-border e-commerce platforms are still the current research hot-spots of value co-creation; case studies and simulation are the main research methods; Combining the background of the Chinese era, these will become future research trends, such as the background of the digital economy, customer participation and interaction, customer- dominant logic, stakeholders and conflicts of interest, and value co-destruction, etc.  © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Linking and visualizing multiple types of entities in a DH knowledge graph generates the need to deal with multiple types of data and media modalities both on the designer and the user side. The InTaVia project develops synoptic visual representations for a multimodal historical knowledge graph which draws together transnational data about cultural objects and historical actors. In this paper we reflect on the question how to integrate and mediate the informational and visual affordances of both kinds of cultural data with hybrid designs and show how a user-centered design process can help to ground the required selections and design choices in an empirical procedure.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - We developed a wearable experimental sensor setup featuring multimodal EEG+fNIRS neuroimaging applicable for in situ experiments of human behavior in interaction with technology. A low-cost electroencephalography (EEG) was integrated with a wearable functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) system, which we present in two parts. Paper A provide an exhaustive description of setup infrastructure, data synchronization process, a procedure for usage, including sensor application, and ensuring high signal quality. This paper (Paper B) demonstrate the setup's usability in three distinct use cases: a conventional human-computer interaction experiment, an in situ driving experiment where participants drive a car in the city and on the highway, and an ashtanga vinyasa yoga practice in situ. Data on cognitive load from highly ecologically valid experimental setups are presented, and we discuss lessons learned. These include acceptable and unacceptable artefacts, data quality, and constructs possible to investigate with the setup. © ICED 2021.All right reserved.

AB  - This chapter explores the emerging focus area of learning experience design (LXD) in the field of learning/instructional design and technology (LIDT) and how associated methods and processes might be applied in practice. Specifically, I highlight how a learning design team engaged in a successful redesign process using a range of human-centered methods and processes that are commonly applied in traditions outside of LIDT such as human-computer interaction (HCI) and user-centered design (UCD), but are less common in our field. I present a brief case study in which a team of learning designers were confronted with unsatisfactory learning outcomes after learners had used an online learning environment to help them solve a sales management problem. The case highlights how the design team first identified design flaws and then applied LXD methods to remedy these flaws, with a specific focus on the design processes that guided this work. I detail how we applied in our own practice a variety of methods associated with LXD, including iterative design, rapid prototyping, analytics, and usability testing. I then briefly present outcomes reported in previously published papers. The chapter concludes with questions to guide discussion and application of the terms, methods, and theoretical framing presented. Recommendations for further readings are provided. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Jill E. Stefaniak and Rebecca M. Reese; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Human Resources X Information System or "Sistem Informasi Kepegawaian X (SIPEG-X)" is a staffing information system that is used to monitor staff performance at a large public university in Indonesia. Since this information system was first developed, there has been no significant update on the system, especially if it is viewed in terms of user-interface (UI) or user experience (UX). This then led to the difficulty of assessing performance against the university staff because of a lack of satisfaction and comfort in using the information system. Therefore, usability evaluation and design refinement of these university staffing information systems was carried out using user-centered design methodology so that a new system in the form of a mobile application was developed to provide solutions to the interface of this staffing information system. Evaluation is conducted through surveys, usability testing, and contextual interviews to assess the usability aspects of the current implemented website application. The evaluation results show that the usability of these information systems needs to be improved and based on the principle of Shneiderman's Eight Golden Rules of Interaction Design, a prototype is proposed to improve the interface as well as the user experience. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Persons with chronic pain experience a lack of support after completing rehabilitation and the responsibility for the return-to-work (RTW) process is taken over by the employer. In addition, employers describe not knowing how to support their employees. Smartphone apps have been increasingly used for self-management, but there is a lack of available eHealth apps with evidence-based content providing digital support for persons with chronic pain and their employers when they return to work. Objective: This study aims to describe the development of a digital support application with evidence-based content that includes a biopsychosocial perspective on chronic pain for sustainable RTW for persons with chronic pain and their employers (SWEPPE [Sustainable Worker Digital Support for Persons With Chronic Pain and Their Employers]). Methods: A user-centered agile design approach was applied. The multidisciplinary project team consisted of health care researchers, a user representative, and a software team. A total of 2 reference groups of 7 persons with chronic pain and 4 employers participated in the development process and usability testing. Mixed methods were used for data collection. The design was revised using feedback from the reference groups. The content of SWEPPE was developed based on existing evidence and input from the reference groups. Results: The reference groups identified the following as important characteristics to include in SWEPPE: keeping users motivated, tracking health status and work situation, and following progress. SWEPPE was developed as a smartphone app for the persons with chronic pain and as a web application for their employers. SWEPPE consists of six modules: the action plan, daily self-rating, self-monitoring graphs, the coach, the library, and shared information with the employer. The employers found the following functions in SWEPPE to be the most useful: employees’ goals related to RTW, barriers to RTW, support wanted from the employer, and the ability to follow employees’ progress. The persons with chronic pain found the following functions in SWEPPE to be the most useful: setting a goal related to RTW, identifying barriers and strategies, and self-monitoring. Usability testing revealed that SWEPPE was safe, useful (ie, provided relevant information), logical, and easy to use with an appealing interface. Conclusions: This study reports the development of a digital support application for persons with chronic pain and their employers. SWEPPE fulfilled the need of support after an interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation program with useful functions such as setting a goal related to RTW, identification of barriers and strategies for RTW, self-monitoring, and sharing information between the employee and the employer. The user-centered agile design approach contributed to creating SWEPPE as a relevant and easy-to-use eHealth intervention. Further studies are needed to examine the effectiveness of SWEPPE in a clinical setting. © 2022 JMIR Research Protocols.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Incorporating user experience (UX) testing when creating research cyberinfrastructure is often overlooked, but if left too late, the cost of retrofitting is considerable, and the very clients the cyberinfrastructure was built to serve may be lost. Successfully integrating UX testing into the product development cycle can be difficult but rewarding. This paper describes how UX evaluations were incorporated over ten years of operation of DataONE (www.dataone.org), a multi-sector science research cyberinfrastructure project created to support the discovery, access, and sustainability of data about life on Earth and the environment that sustains it. The diverse stakeholders in DataONE include data creators and users such as researchers and government workers across the broad scope of the earth and environmental sciences as well as those who hold and manage data such as libraries and data repositories. Between 2009 and 2019 DataONE members designed and constructed data management tools and services to fulfill the DataONE objectives. To assist in achieving its goals, a participatory design approach was used by establishing several largely volunteer and stakeholder-representative working groups, including the Usability and Assessment Working Group. This Working Group conducted over forty UX evaluations to assess the usability of DataONE products and websites at various stages of the development process. In addition to improving the usability of DataONE products, the UX evaluations fostered community involvement by building trust and engagement with the products being developed. The DataONE UX experience yields several important lessons which will improve the success of other projects. It is our conclusion that UX testing should be a mandatory part of the design of any cyberinfrastructure project. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Data analytics-driven solutions are widely used in various intelligent systems, where humans and machines make decisions collaboratively based on predictions. Human factors such as personality and trust have significant effects on such human–machine collaborations.This paper investigates effects of personality traits on user trust in human–machine collaborations under uncertainty and cognitive load conditions. A user study of 42 subjects in a repeated factorial design experiment found that uncertainty presentation led to increased trust but only under low cognitive load conditions when users had sufficient cognitive resources to process the information. Presentation of uncertainty under high load conditions led to a decrease in trust. When further drilling down into personality trait groups of users, overall, users with low Openness showed the highest trust. Furthermore, under the low cognitive load condition, it was found that the trust was enhanced under ambiguity uncertainty with low Agreeableness, low Neuroticism, high Extraversion, high Conscientiousness, and high Openness. Under the high cognitive load condition, high Neuroticism and low Extraversion benefitted the trust without the uncertainty presentation. The results demonstrated that different personality traits affected trust differently under uncertainty and cognitive load conditions. A framework of user trust feedback loop was set up to incorporate the study results into human–machine collaborations for the meaningful participatory design. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The success of horticultural cultivation comes from climate and environmental factors. Climate change affects the number and quality of plants. The increasing risk of pests and plant diseases is due to weather anomalies. Therefore, this research aims to develop a system that can monitor microclimate conditions in plants and IoT control sensor devices via an Android-based smartphone. The research stages start with planning, requirement analysis, designing, system implementation, testing, and lastly feedback. The system is built using the Flutter Framework which produces Android-based applications. The development of this system was designed using the Scrum method in the development process and the UCD (User-Centered Design) approach for the usability evaluation process with users. The system was tested using Black Box Testing and Usability Testing. The black box test results are successful for all tested features. Usability testing was carried out using the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) method using a 7-point Likert scale by testing the system on 16 respondents who were divided into 8 respondents for each user group, namely farmer and public respondents. The results of usability testing obtained an overall score for each user group, where the overall average value for the public respondent is 5.90 and the overall average value for farmers is 6.06. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the system is feasible to use for users since it provides good usability, information, and user interface for monitoring microclimate conditions.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Software development methods have been evolved to enable producing usable systems rapidly while considering all requirements. Several studies have focused on the need to balance between rapid development and capturing requirements related to user experience and business workflow. This balance has become more urging during COVID19 because many businesses want to quickly transfer to usable electronic systems that are accurate, efficient, easy to learn, satisfy users and support remote work. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework by integrating Rapid Application Development (RAD) method with Participatory Design (PD) method for enabling rapid production of usable systems. Both RAD and PD consist of design stages that can overlap and generate new phases where users participate in the design process and accelerate the production. Five usability tests are also added to the framework to validate the usability of the design at all stages. The Action Research method is used to assess the framework empirically in a context of an urgent need to an electronic system, and qualitative data analyses were conducted. The results show that the framework can be adopted by software companies because it satisfies the requirements of adopting software development methods. Also, the system developed using the framework is usable. The paper concludes that COVID19 affects software development by emphasizing rapid development while maintaining workflow. Also, using video conference for remote design assists in meeting users more frequently and in creating concise requirement documentation.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Pain is one of the most common symptoms experienced by patients with cancer at all stages of the disease, many of whom experience poor pain control. Findings from earlier studies suggest that mobile health (mHealth) approaches may have value in the field of pain management. Currently, development is at an early stage and the needs and preferences of users are not yet well understood. The aim of this study is to report the design and development of a mHealth-based pain recording system for this population to support effective pain management. A user-centred design (UCD) approach with multiple stages, including usability testing, was adopted for achieving this and ensure the system's clinical utility. Usability testing was conducted on high-fidelity clickable prototypes developed for the system with eleven representative system users. The system was well-received, and all participants found it well-Aligned with their needs and easy to use, with only a few addressable usability issues reported. Captured usability metrics indicated that the under-development system has the potential to be effective, efficient and satisfying for users. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Guidance and counseling services have an important role in moral assistance and directing students' talents and interests. The Covid-19 pandemic has hampered Counseling Guidance services because learning activities are carried out online. This study aims to conduct a UI and UX assessment of the counseling application based on the Cased Based Reasoning algorithm called B-Talk. This application was developed with a mobile platform design. Infernalities than the approach used is the User-Centered Design (UCD). The UCD approach is an approach that uses factors human, knowledge of usability techniques, and an interactive approach to developing design and systems. The UI(User Interface) and UX(User Experience) designs that have been produced will be tested with an expert assessment of Counseling Guidance which includes two aspects, namely usability testing and User Experience Question (UEQ). The media validation assessment was obtained from an average value of 89.2% of the standard feasibility without revision. In this case, it can be concluded that the B-Talk application design can be used as its function for Counseling Guidance media for adolescents. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Usability studies are a crucial part of developing user-centered designs and they can be conducted using a variety of different methods. Unmoderated usability surveys are more efficient and cost-effective and lend themselves better to larger participant pools in comparison to moderated usability surveys. However, unmoderated usability surveys could increase the collection of unreliable data due to the survey participants’ careless responding (CR). In this study, we compared the remote moderated and remote unmoderated usability testing sessions for a web-based simulation and modeling software. The usability study was conducted with 72 participants who were randomly assigned into a moderated and unmoderated groups. Our results show that moderated sessions produced more reliable data in most of the tested outcomes and that the data from unmoderated sessions needed some optimization in order to filter out unreliable data. We discuss methods to isolate unreliable data and recommend ways of managing it. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Metaphor is a representation of objects and situations that have meaning and comparable to the real thing to convey the message to people. This study reveals design metaphor issues for paddy farmer population in agriculture domain in Malaysia. The work is motivated by the ICT-Based Agriculture Flagship Blueprint of the Malaysian Government, an initiative to equip agriculture stakeholders in Malaysia including farmers with ICT knowledge on multiple platforms e.g. mobile phones. The metaphors design is deemed to have a huge potential to improve usability through localising user interface of related apps. The work is conducted involves three main studies in the fieldwork. The paddy farmers were involved in the entire development process to be able to obtain deeper understanding of their background, tasks, and environment. The study has led us to proposed nine elements incorporated as guidelines in metaphor design. A mobile paddy app is developed to demonstrate the practicality of the design metaphors. The app provides several main features such as diary, calendar, reminder, and pesticides and crop illness information. Then, this app was evaluated by conducting usability testing with the farmers. The results were gathered and being analysed using descriptive statistics which shown positive constructs. The participants (N=5) expressed agreement with the system usability (M=1.62, SD=0.43), strong agreement in system appearance (M=1.34, SD=0.22), and design metaphor (M=1.5, SD=0.27) and agreement for overall acceptance (M=1.6, SD=0.35). © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - In medical imaging, (semi-)automatic image analysis techniques have been proposed to support the current time-consuming and cognitively demanding practice of manual segmentation of regions of interest (ROIs). The recently proposed image query language ImgQL, based on spatial logic and model checking, represents segmentation methods as concise, domain-oriented, human-readable procedures aimed at domain experts rather than technologists, and has been validated in several case studies. Such efforts are directed towards a human-centred Artificial Intelligence methodology. To this aim, we complemented the ongoing research line with a study of the Human-Computer Interaction aspects. In this work we investigate the design of a graphical user interface (GUI) prototype that supports the analysis procedure with minimal impact on the focus and the memory load of domain experts. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a program similar to cryptocurrency that runs on blockchain. Due to its recent popularity, the user count increases every day. NFT, a relatively new technology compared to cryptocurrency brings many new terms and complicated user flows. The study was conducted to explore the motives of new NFT users, to identify the usability issues in those platforms that tend to be a barrier and to suggest relevant design approaches that help new users freely use the platform. A survey was conducted to identify the understanding of NFTs among various user groups. Further, usability testing and heuristic evaluation were carried out for the top 2 popular NFT marketplaces. The results show that the NFT platforms need more usability improvements, especially for first-time users. Based on the findings, relevant user-centered design approaches are suggested and are expected to improve the usability of the NFT platforms.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - To support the pediatric intensive care unit with the COVID-19 pandemic, we followed a user-centered design process to create a dashboard in a context where direct access to users was impossible. To this end, we applied contextual inquiry, user interview, requirement definition, iterative design with user validation and usability testing in a remote fashion. Being unable to be physically present at the hospital limited our understanding of the context of use, extended the duration of the study and limited the number of interviews and testing sessions. However, we were able to benefit from the experience of our team members, adopt an efficient decision-making method to select appropriate requirements and use remote moderated usability testing to conform our design process to an aggressive timeline. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Virtual Reality (VR) Serious Games can improve physical, cognitive and mental rehabilitation by helping patients stay engaged and entertained while performing rehabilitation exercises. Patients need therapist monitoring and intervention tailored to each patient and to each point in their unique rehabilitation process. This article reports on a prototype development of a therapist interface for an occupational therapy rehabilitation VR game, which was guided by user research and co-creation sessions. Usability testing was carried out with low-and high-fidelity prototypes. Despite achieving a System Usability Scale score of 93.75, the interface requires further development at the level of game-session creation and parameter personalization. This article showcases relevant challenges in interaction design for including the therapist in the patient's game-playing while allowing fast/efficient setup of appropriate game-based therapy, thus balancing patient outcomes and efficient use of therapist time and effort. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The more people commute by bicycle, the higher is the number of cyclists using their smartphones while cycling and compromising traffic safety. We have designed, implemented and evaluated two prototypes for smartphone control devices that do not require the cyclists to remove their hands from the handlebars - the three-button device Tribike and the rotation-controlled Brotate. The devices were the result of a user-centred design process where we identified the key features needed for a on-bike smartphone control device. We evaluated the devices in a biking exercise with 19 participants, where users completed a series of common smartphone tasks. The study showed that Brotate allowed for significantly more lateral control of the bicycle and both devices reduced the cognitive load required to use the smartphone. Our work contributes insights into designing interfaces for cycling. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Many applications are developed to assist in practicing zero waste, but the number of users for such applications is few. In this research, interaction for a new zero-waste application that uses gamification was designed to increase the number of users. The usage of gamification focused on cooperative elements because the practice of zero waste involves collaboration to achieve a mutual goal of decreasing waste. The design process used a user-centered design (UCD) approach, with the final product in a prototype application for a mobile device. The interface design aims for effectiveness and utility as usability goals, while its user experience goals are helpful and motivating. Based on usability testing conducted on the prototype, it is concluded that cooperative gamification elements usable in zero-waste applications include user groups, user roles, group-based goals, and cumulative points. The achievement of usability and user experience goals is measured using several metrics. They are success rate, single ease questions (SEQ), System Usability Scale (SUS), Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) subscale Value/Usefulness, and IMI subscale Interest/Enjoyment for measuring motivation. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Research knowledge graphs allow the enrichment of large amounts of data. Still, in some fields like the humanities sources are distributed in small archives not connected by the large research knowledge graphs or hubs like Wikidata. In comparison to these large research knowledge graphs, light-weight knowledge graphs allow the creation of small-scale hubs within the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud as well as the re-usage of larger hubs like Wikidata in order to enrich one’s own data. This paper describes the potentials of research knowledge graphs for interlinking archives and data hubs offering an overarching systematic overview to topic related distributed data. The potentials of the graph technology are shown in action for a concrete case in the field of history of education, focusing on school archives. Also, the research knowledge graph enables archivists and researchers to annotate and enrich the graph in order to customize it to their needs and research interests. It also facilitates processing of the heterogeneously structured data from larger hubs in order to increase coverage of the graph. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Background: One in five U.S. adults lives with some kind of mental health condition and 4.6% of all U.S. adults have a serious mental illness. The Internet has become the first place for these people to seek online mental health information for help. However, online mental health information is not well-organized and often of low quality. There have been efforts in building evidence-based mental health knowledgebases curated with information manually extracted from the high-quality scientific literature. Manual extraction is inefficient. Crowdsourcing can potentially be a low-cost mechanism to collect labeled data from non-expert laypeople. However, there is not an existing annotation tool integrated with popular crowdsourcing platforms to perform the information extraction tasks. In our previous work, we prototyped a Semantic Text Annotation Tool (STAT) to address this gap. Objective: We aimed to refine the STAT prototype (1) to improve its usability and (2) to enhance the crowdsourcing workflow efficiency to facilitate the construction of evidence-based mental health knowledgebase, following a user-centered design (UCD) approach. Methods: Following UCD principles, we conducted four design iterations to improve the initial STAT prototype. In the first two iterations, usability testing focus groups were conducted internally with 8 participants recruited from a convenient sample, and the usability was evaluated with a modified System Usability Scale (SUS). In the following two iterations, usability testing was conducted externally using the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform. In each iteration, we summarized the usability testing results through thematic analysis, identified usability issues, and conducted a heuristic evaluation to map identified usability issues to Jakob Nielsen's usability heuristics. We collected suggested improvements in the usability testing sessions and enhanced STAT accordingly in the next UCD iteration. After four UCD iterations, we conducted a case study of the system on MTurk using mental health related scientific literature. We compared the performance of crowdsourcing workers with two expert annotators from two aspects: efficiency and quality. Results: The SUS score increased from 70.3 ± 12.5 to 81.1 ± 9.8 after the two internal UCD iterations as we improved STAT's functionality based on the suggested improvements. We then evaluated STAT externally through MTurk in the following two iterations. The SUS score decreased to 55.7 ± 20.1 in the third iteration, probably because of the complexity of the tasks. After further simplification of STAT and the annotation tasks with an improved annotation guideline, the SUS score increased to 73.8 ± 13.8 in the fourth iteration of UCD. In the evaluation case study, on average, the workers spent 125.5 ± 69.2 s on the onboarding tutorial and the crowdsourcing workers spent significantly less time on the annotation tasks compared to the two experts. In terms of annotation quality, the workers’ annotation results achieved average F1-scores ranged from 0.62 to 0.84 for the different sentences. Conclusions: We successfully developed a web-based semantic text annotation tool, STAT, to facilitate the curation of semantic web knowledgebases through four UCD iterations. The lessons learned from the UCD process could serve as a guide to further enhance STAT and the development and design of other crowdsourcing-based semantic text annotation tasks. Our study also showed that a well-organized, informative annotation guideline is as important as the annotation tool itself. Further, we learned that a crowdsourcing task should consist of multiple simple microtasks rather than a complicated task. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The concept of usability, which affects the quality and cost of the software projects, has become essential in recent years. There is a need to integrate usability testing activities and techniques into the development processes; however, integration is difficult. Therefore, this study proposes user-centered behavioral (UCB) software development model, which aims to bridge the gap between human–computer interaction (HCI) and software engineering (SE) disciplines. A triangulation methodology of mixed methods is used to understand the current situation in software development companies in terms of usability and user-centered software development by survey and interviews. Their results are then used to inform the development of the proposed model. The UCB software development model proposes a process in which several tools and techniques from SE and HCI are integrated to facilitate the production of highly usable software. In essence, the model proposes an iterative process that combines behavior-driven development (BDD)—an agile approach that enables a better understanding and analysis of the requirements—with the style guides, usability tests, heuristic evaluation, and Wizard of Oz techniques of HCI. The model was evaluated in a pilot project and then is improved based on feedback gathered. Participants' feedback supported the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Fertility tracking application (FTA) is a type of digital health product in the form of a digital tracker that helps women manage their menstruation. Given that every woman has different menstrual characteristics, FTA has the potential to alienate certain groups of users. Thus, the aim of this research is to create an interaction design that can accommodate both normal and outlier users of FTA. The design methodology is user-centered design so that the iteration of design process is driven by feedbacks from existing user groups. Based on the user research, it is found that current FTAs, including but not limited to Flo and MyCalendar, have following problems: lack of ways for users to set up their preferred period tracking, lack of personalization, features with low visibility, and lack of explanation of unfamiliar medical terminologies in the application. Thus, an interaction is designed to address these problems. The solution allows each user to personalize various aspects of menstrual tracking. Usability goals of the interaction design solution are effective to use and easy to learn with helpful as user experience goals. The results of the interaction design evaluation using usability testing show that the solution is usable with a Single Ease Question score of 6.84 out of 7, a System Usability Score of 92 (Grade A/Excellent) out of 100, and an NPS score of +60 out of +100. Usability goal effective to use is achieved with 100% task completion and easy to learn is achieved with a score of 4.6 out of 5. Finally, helpful as user experience goal is achieved with a score of 5 out of 5.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - India is the world’s largest exporter of HCI products. However, limited research is available on the HCI design processes adopted in the Indian industry. This paper reports findings from in-depth interviews with 25 Indian HCI design team leads on the design processes followed in the industry and the competencies expected from design professionals. One of the key findings from the interviews suggests that the industry expects a graduate to have an understanding of the business value of the design processes adopted for a given problem. It is also expected that entrants have knowledge of different types of HCI design processes relevant to specific organizations like agile sprints, lean processes, etc. Further, for each of the different design processes adopted by the industry, the specific core skills are expected to be present in the new professional in order to work seamlessly in the industry. Skills like stakeholder engagement ability, sprint usability testing, time management, user research techniques, usage of appropriate terminologies in design communication, co-creation ability with stakeholders of different expertise, etc., are what the industry expects from new HCI professionals. The findings of this study have curricular, pedagogical, and strategic relevance for both HCI academics and industry. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Background: Latinx family caregivers of individuals with dementia face many barriers to caregiver support access. Interventions to alleviate these barriers are urgently needed. Objective: This study aimed to describe the development of CuidaTEXT, a tailored SMS text messaging intervention to support Latinx family caregivers of individuals with dementia. Methods: CuidaTEXT is informed by the stress process framework and social cognitive theory. We developed and refined CuidaTEXT using a mixed methods approach that included thematic analysis and descriptive statistics. We followed 6 user-centered design stages, namely, the selection of design principles, software vendor collaboration, evidence-based foundation, caregiver and research and clinical advisory board guidance, sketching and prototyping, and usability testing of the prototype of CuidaTEXT among 5 Latinx caregivers. Results: CuidaTEXT is a bilingual 6-month-long SMS text messaging-based intervention tailored to caregiver needs that includes 1-3 daily automatic messages (n=244) about logistics, dementia education, self-care, social support, end of life, care of the person with dementia, behavioral symptoms, and problem-solving strategies; 783 keyword-driven text messages for further help with the aforementioned topics; live chat interaction with a coach for further help; and a 19-page reference booklet summarizing the purpose and functions of the intervention. The 5 Latinx caregivers who used the prototype of CuidaTEXT scored an average of 97 out of 100 on the System Usability Scale. Conclusions: CuidaTEXT's prototype demonstrated high usability among Latinx caregivers. CuidaTEXT's feasibility is ready to be tested. © Jaime Perales-Puchalt, Mariola Acosta-Rullán, Mariana Ramírez-Mantilla, Paul Espinoza-Kissell, Eric Vidoni, Michelle Niedens, Edward Ellerbeck, Ladson Hinton, Linda Loera, A Susana Ramírez, Esther Lara, Amber Watts, Kristine Williams, Jason Resendez, Jeffrey Burns.

AB  - The rapid development of information and communication technologies has enabled a value co-creation paradigm for developing industrial products and services, where massive heterogeneous data and multidisciplinary knowledge are generated and leveraged. In this context, Knowledge Graph (KG) emerges as a promising tool to elicit, fuse, process, and utilize numerous entities and relationships embedded in products and services, as well as their stakeholders. Nevertheless, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is scarcely any comprehensive and thorough discussion about making full use of KG's potentials to solve pain points of product development and service innovation in the industry. Aiming to fill this gap, this paper conducted a systematic survey of KG exploitations in industrial products and services and the customizations towards higher adaptability to practices. The authors selected 119 representative papers (up to 10/03/2021) together with other 29 supplementary works to summarize the technical and practical efforts and discuss the current challenges of exploiting KG in industrial products and services. Meantime, this work also highlights enhancing KG's availability and boosting its productivity in industrial products and services development as the core future perspectives to explore. It is hoped that this work can provide a basis for the explorations and implementations of KG-supported industrial product and services development, and attract more open discussions to the exploitation of KG-enabled industrial information systems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Indonesia is the second largest food waste producer country in the world after Saudi Arabia. This condition is very worrying because food waste could impact on many aspects of people's life including food security, economy and environment. One of the approaches to solve this problem is to make mobile application to change human consumption behavior. It was also found that majority of interaction designs for sustainable food consumption practices are not yet fully using behavior change theory (BCT) as a basis design decision making so that it cannot be ascertained the resulting design intervention can influence user behavior. Fogg Behavior Model (FBM) Theory provides an explanation regarding what factors can be used to change human behavior. This project aims to apply FBM theory to the development of application interaction design for reducing household food waste with user-centered design (UCD) approach that has been adapted. Low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototyping are also used in solution design stage of UCD. Output from this project is high-fidelity prototype of Spoonful with usability goals effective to use, easy to learn, and user experience goals helpful. Each of goals are measured with usability testing using task completion rate, Single Ease Question (SEQ) and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) value/usefulness subscale. System Usability Scale (SUS) and self-evaluation of the theory of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) are also used for testing on overall usability and behavior change. The results show that the prototype is effective to use with success rate 94.3%, easy to learn with SEQ score 6.12 out of 7, helpful with IMI score for the value/usefulness subscale score of 6.59 out of 7, grade C acceptable with SUS score 74.58 out of 100 and help people to move to action stage from preparation stage with self-evaluation of TTM theory score 71.83 out of 80. FBM theory is very helpful and proven to provide better design justification for behavior change. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Syllabi as an academic genre used by students and instructors should not only be primarily focused on its content, but also the modality. This study investigates students' experience of using web-based liquid syllabus through a questionnaire in an online synchronous technical communication service class and evaluates the usefulness of liquid syllabus through usability testing after the semester ends. Findings from the pre-study survey and usability testing show students' self-reflection on using the two types of syllabi, reveal the problem of liquid syllabus design, and address their experience. The paper discusses the study limitation and suggests that instructors could use a liquid syllabus to improve students' learning experience.  © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Objectives. The active factor along with light exercise can reduce static muscle work and increase muscle flexibility and endurance. Accordingly, this study aimed to design and prototype a new active footrest, implemented in conventional sitting workstations, and to test its usability among office workers. Methods. The steps taken to design and prototype the active footrest were: selection of an exercise appropriate for goals of ergonomic interventions; idea development; selection of the best conceptual design; design with SOLIDWORKS version 2016; and fabrication of a prototype. Afterward, usability of the active footrest prototype was assessed among 20 office workers (10 females) using field data by the system usability scale. Results. Upon completion of the design steps, the active footrest prototype was prototyped by taking into account design criteria (e.g., functionality, inclusive design, easy application and reduction of additional body movement), anthropometric data and mechanical properties. The participants rated the usability of the active workstation as 89 ± 8.21 (out of 100), indicating good usability results. Conclusion. In this study, an active footrest was designed and prototyped to perform knee extension exercise with the capability of being implemented in conventional sitting workstations. © 2021 Central Institute for Labour Protection–National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB).

AB  - Education is the key to progress the development of a nation because a great nation must have a strong educational foundation. However, the poor quality of education becomes the obstacle that often occurs. The quality of education is influenced by the interaction of communication in the learning process. Therefore, the interactive learning method could be the solution to improve the quality of interaction and communication in the learning process. Even more, interactive learning could improve the learning gain and conceptual understanding through the interaction of students in the learning process. However, several challenges are faced in the learning process due to the pandemic. Interaction in learning is limited to break the chain of COVID-19 transmission. The learning model has to be adaptive during the pandemic to improve its continuity through online learning. Therefore, MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) could be the answer to offer the course for the learning process in an organized and structured online classroom environment. Based on the user research, we analyze the user needs and requirements to implement interactive learning methods, discussion and think-pair-share using user-centered design approach in ISO 9241-210:2010. The outcome of this research is to create a high-fidelity prototype that has usability goals efficient to use, effective to use, and user experience goals helpful for students. We validate the interaction design using usability testing with SEQ, SUS, and Completion Rate during testing with the user.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Video-based learning is one of the digital platforms that can assist teachers in teaching with face-to-face collaboration and online learning during the hybrid learning period. But the fact is that in recent years many teachers are not proficient in making interesting video-based learning and the lack of availability of supporting media equipment to make it easier for teachers to understand making video-based learning or students who have difficulty accessing video-based learning due to infrastructure constraints. This research refers to the topic of learning technology. Therefore, in this research paper, we try to create a web design solution to overcome the problems that occur by using the theory of Nielsen Attributes of Usability and User-Centered Design in testing user needs and also testing usability in producing website solutions. This study collects data from 112 respondents in April 2022.

AB  - The number of investors in Indonesia could still be said to be small when compared to the number of investors in other countries due to the lack of knowledge of the Indonesians about financial asset investment. Indonesian also consider the use of financial asset investment applications to be complicated. This related problem will be solved by creating an application interaction design that is expected to help motivate Indonesians to invest using a user-centric design (UCD) approach. Questionnaires were distributed to determine user needs for financial asset investing applications. Through the questionnaire, it was formulated that the purpose of usability for financial asset investment applications is to be effective and easy to learn, while the purpose of user experience is to be helpful and motivating. The interaction design is tested in two iterations, both for the low-fidelity prototype and the high-fidelity prototype. Based on the last test on high-fidelity prototype, the interaction design of the financial asset investment application has been able to meet the objective of being effective to use with a completion rate of 100% and easy to learn with an average Simple Easy Question (SEQ) score of 6.593 out of 7.00. The designed interaction design has also been able to achieve the goal of user experience helpful as measured by Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) Value/Usefulness with a value of 6.635 out of 7.00 while for motivation it is measured by IMI Interest/Enjoyment with a score of 6.375 out of 7.00. The achieved testing scores could indicate that the users who act as respondents are agree that the interaction design is helpful and gives motivation.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - With the rise of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), AI has increasingly become a partner to human designers in co-creating cultural artifacts. While generative models have been applied in various creative tasks across disciplines, a theoretical foundation for understanding human-GAN collaboration is yet to be developed. Drawing from the mixed-initiative co-creation community, we propose a preliminary framework to analyze co-creative GAN applications. We identify four primary interaction patterns: Curating, Exploring, Evolving, and Conditioning. The suggested framework enables us to discuss the affordances and limitations of the different kind of interactions underlying co-creative GAN applications. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors

AB  - Background Poor self-management of heart failure (HF) has contributed to poor health outcomes. Sensor-controlled digital games (SCDGs) integrates data from behavior-tracking sensors to trigger progress, rewards, content, and positive feedback in a digital game to motivate real-time behaviors. Objectives To assess the usability of an SCDG prototype over a week of game-playing among 10 older adults with HF in their homes. Methods During initial play, participants' SCDG experiences were observed in their homes using a checklist based on the seven-item Serious Game User Evaluator (SeGUE) instrument. After a week of game-playing, participants completed a survey guided by the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, to provide their perceptions of the SCDG's usability. Qualitative analysis via semistructured interview-derived themes on experiences playing the SCDG, perceptions regarding engaging with the SCDG, and any usability issues encountered. Results Ten HF participants (50% women and 50% White) played the SCDG for an average of 6 out of 7 days. Nine found the SCDG to be interesting, satisfying, and easy to play. The average step count over a week was 4,117 steps (range: 967-9,892). Average adherence with weight monitoring was 5.9 days in a week. Qualitative analysis yielded outcomes regarding attitudes toward SCDG, and barriers and facilitators that influenced participants' engagement with the SCDG. Conclusion To the best of the authors' knowledge, this usability and feasibility study is the first to report an SCDG designed to improve HF self-management behaviors of older adults in their homes. Future research should consider several issues, such as user profiles, prior game-playing experiences, and network conditions most suitable for connected health interventions for older adults living in the community. © 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag.

AB  - Although the Education sector has pioneered the use of technology, the pace of technological change has outstripped the slower processes of theoretical development and critical reflection, so the field is highly fragmented and lacks a comprehensive evidence base to support future development. In this paper, we consider how the insights offered by games and a psychological perspective can address the current challenges. Both games and e-learning specialists are facing similar challenges and would therefore benefit from adopting a more integrated approach in the future. We demonstrate how this integration can best be achieved by viewing the challenges through a psychological lens which informs theory, research and practice in user-centred design, supports the development of more widely applicable theories of learning and pedagogy, recognises of the complexity of the contexts in which learning occurs and offers an established evidence-based framework to aid integration at the theoretical level. This emphasises the continued importance of classic concepts such as transfer, cognitive load and the increasing blurred boundaries between formal and informal learning, but also in terms of methodology and as a catalyst for future debate and discussion. © 2019 British Educational Research Association

AB  - Children aged 10-12 years old are considered able to know and do first-aid. At those ages, children have been exposed to various learning medias. One of learning medias is game applications. Based on preliminary observations, by testing usability of existing game apps, User Interface is considered not good. Therefore, the users cannot use the application properly. This is caused by several factors. They are effectiveness, productivity, accessibility and universality. Applications that have low usability can be caused by the imperfection or insufficient of the application suitability with the needs of the user. In order to fit the user interface to the needs of the user, it is necessary to model the user interface of the first-aid application game using User Centered Design (UCD) method. Using UCD is used to generate a User Interface model that fits to the needs of the user. The modeling of the game application is formed in a prototype. After that, a test is conducted to the user to measure the usability of the game by using Quality in Use Integrated Measurement (QUIM). The results of usability testing is 81.05%. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Speech and language disorders in children account for about 6% of the population, and if not treated adequately they persist. Thus, affected children may experience long-term problems such as both diminished socialization and literacy in later life. Assistive technologies in the form of serious games have been successfully used to support language and speech therapies, but their developers have the challenge of improving their human-computer interfaces. This paper describes the design and development of a mobile software (a serious game app) that runs on a tablet. Its main objective is to support children's speech and language therapy of English language tenses. Important usability testing and design guidelines regarding mobile interfaces are addressed. Future work will include usability testing based on the user-centered design (UCD) paradigm and prototyping to improve its interface design. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - THEMIS-AR is an augmented reality (AR) app designed for mobile devices that was developed to assist first responders on disaster relief operations, which a very demanding context for users, regarding both the physical and the cognitive and emotional demands. In fact, the specificity of the usage environment imposes special care in addressing the interaction of the users with the system, regarding both the mobile devices technical characteristics and the workload. The paper provides a brief description of the THEMIS-AR architecture and features, focusing on the assessment of a concept demonstrator developed based on the UCD cycle (i.e., context of use characterization, requirements definition, solution implementation, and testing and validation). The usability testing setup and script adopted while performing field tests are described and the results obtained, namely regarding the application of the User Experience Questionnaire to benchmark the app evaluation in comparison with a set of previous evaluations made with this methodology. These results were compared with the user perceptions collected using a final questionnaire namely based on the System Usability Scale. The main findings resulting from this initial set of users are summarized and presented the way ahead for this component of the THEMIS project. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Computational thinking education nowadays gets more attention around the world because of its importance. In Indonesia, computational thinking has not received attention as much as in other developed countries. However, there is a community that already focuses on promoting computational thinking to Indonesian students through annual competitions, which is Bebras Indonesia. The problems that are used in the competition also have been adapted into a game. The game aims to help student practicing for the competition, but the game still has several limitations to be used by Indonesian students. Therefore, this paper researches similar games design interaction that suits Indonesian students, particularly for upper elementary school students. The type of the game is a serious game that has the main goal of learning. An approach of user-centered design was used to develop the design interaction. Usability testing was conducted to verify the result of the design interaction in two iterations. The result of the research shows that the design interaction is effective with a score of completion rate of 100% and easy to learn with a score of SEQ 6,37 out of 7. It is also enjoyable for students based on the result of the E-Gameflow questionnaire score of 5,83 out of 7 and an IMI enjoyability score of 5,77 out of 7.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Emerging technologies have played an important role in driving major changes in human society. However, the advent of most technologies is typically initially accompanied by confusion; this is often because technology developers overlook the user perspective. This study was conducted to systematically determine the fundamental causes of problems that users encounter when they interact with blockchain technology, one of the promising emerging technologies today, and to suggest relevant design strategies. To this end, usability evaluation was conducted for the KDEX decentralized exchange application. To ensure the effective identification of the significant usability problems, heuristic evaluation with four experts and usability testing with 23 experimental participants were carried out. The results obtained show that more user-centered design is necessary to enable the widespread use of decentralized applications. Based on the experimental findings, actionable design strategies that facilitate the effective utilization of emerging technologies are suggested. The proposed strategies are expected to enable users to easily understand and navigate applications based on these technologies. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This paper describes the development of a point of care clinical guidelines mobile application. A user-centred design approach was utilised to inform the design of a smartphone application, this included: Observations; a survey; focus groups and an analysis of popular apps utilised by clinicians in a UK NHS Trust. Usability testing was conducted to inform iterations of the application, which presents clinicians with a variety of integrated tools to aid in decision making and information retrieval. The study found that clinicians use a mixture of technology to retrieve information, which is often inefficient or has poor usability. It also shows that smartphone application development for use in UK hospitals needs to consider the variety of users and their clinical knowledge and work pattern. This study highlights the need for applying user-centred design methods in the design of information presented to clinicians and the need for clinical information delivery that is efficient and easy to use at the bedside. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Usability testing is a critical phase of the User-Centered Design and development process, where product teams can observe and measure the usability of their software solutions’ functionality, interactions and user interfaces. The subsequent validation sessions may generate a large, overwhelming, volume of empirical and unstructured data that need to be analyzed to determine meaningful outcomes for informed decisions. In this paper, we overview a new method and tool, namely EUREKA, guiding a product team, through a real-life business scenario, to analyze its usability study qualitative data and to produce comparable and replicable results, improving the User Experience of its product. © 2019, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - Intelligent systems offering decision support can lessen cognitive load and improve the efficiency of decision making in a variety of contexts. These systems assist users by evaluating multiple courses of action and recommending the right action at the right time. Modern intelligent systems using machine learning introduce new capabilities in decision support, but they can come at a cost. Machine learning models provide little explanation of their outputs or reasoning process, making it difficult to determine when it is appropriate to trust, or if not, what went wrong. In order to improve trust and ensure appropriate reliance on these systems, users must be afforded increased transparency, enabling an understanding of the systems reasoning, and an explanation of its predictions or classifications. Here we discuss the salient factors in designing transparent intelligent systems using machine learning, and present the results of a user-centered design study. We propose design guidelines derived from our study, and discuss next steps for designing for intelligent system transparency. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Children with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) are required to manage their illness to alleviate further long-term complications. Although children are expected to engage in appropriate self-management activities once they become older, many of the children remain passive actors in managing their condition. Due to the lack of knowledge and skills, as well as changes in parent-child relationships, children demonstrate low self-care adherence. Consequently, parents also face difficulties in defining their role in long-term care. This study, part of a larger study, comprised of three phases: mobile app development, prototype feasibility testing, and usability testing with child-parent dyads users. As part of the third phase, this study used qualitative interviews with 24 child-parent dyads to understand the existing facilitators and barriers in using the app. Our findings suggest that users found that the app reminded them to track their blood glucose (BG) values and facilitated child-parent communication in a user-friendly manner. By capturing the emerging themes in adopting the app from the children's perspective, we will iteratively refine the app to better suit the users' requirements. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - This paper explores the difference in the effects of role-playing and usability testing on the design thinking process of novice designers. While usability testing helps in understanding user mental models by observing user behavior as the user interacts with a system, role-playing relies on a designer’s own perception about the user where the designer him/herself acts as a user. The difference in user research methods that leads to a different understanding of the user might reflect in the design thinking process of a designer while ideating for solutions of an HCI design problem. This paper presents findings from an experimental study done with novice designers to understand the differences in design thinking processes when designers themselves conducted usability tests versus when they designed using role-playing on persona data given to them. The findings suggest that direct observation of user behavior leads to more consideration for users and therefore better user-centered thinking process than the imaginative role-playing. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - An access control policy usually consists of a structured set of rules describing when an access to a resource should be permitted or denied, based on the attributes of the different entities involved in the access request. A policy containing a large number of rules and attributes can be hard to navigate, making policy editing and fixing a complex task. In some contexts, visualisation techniques are known to be helpful when dealing with similar amounts of complexity; however, finding a useful visual representation is a long process that requires observation, supposition, testing and refinement. In this paper, we report on the design process for a visualisation tool for access control policies, which led to the tool VisABAC. We first present a comprehensive survey of the existing literature, followed by the description of the participatory design for VisABAC. We then describe VisABAC itself, a tool that implements Logic Circle Packing to pursue the reduction of cognitive load on Access Control Policies. VisABAC is a web-page component, developed in Javascript using the D3.js library, and easily usable without any particular setup. Finally, we present a testing methodology that we developed to prove usability by conducting a controlled experiment with 32 volunteers; we asked them to change some attribute values in order to obtain a given decision for a policy and measured the time taken by participant to conduct these tasks (the faster, the better). We obtained a small to medium effect size that indicates that VisABAC is a promising tool for authoring and editing access control policies. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Background: Dietary supplements (DSs) are widely used. However, consumers know little about the safety and efficacy of DSs. There is a growing interest in accessing health information online; however, health information, especially online information on DSs, is scattered with varying levels of quality. In our previous work, we prototyped a web application, ALOHA, with interactive graph-based visualization to facilitate consumers' browsing of the integrated DIetary Supplement Knowledge base (iDISK) curated from scientific resources, following an iterative user-centered design (UCD) process. Methods: Following UCD principles, we carried out two design iterations to enrich the functionalities of ALOHA and enhance its usability. For each iteration, we conducted a usability assessment and design session with a focus group of 8-10 participants and evaluated the usability with a modified System Usability Scale (SUS). Through thematic analysis, we summarized the identified usability issues and conducted a heuristic evaluation to map them to the Gerhardt-Powals' cognitive engineering principles. We derived suggested improvements from each of the usability assessment session and enhanced ALOHA accordingly in the next design iteration. Results: The SUS score in the second design iteration decreased to 52.2 ± 11.0 from 63.75 ± 7.2 in our original work, possibly due to the high number of new functionalities we introduced. By refining existing functionalities to make the user interface simpler, the SUS score increased to 64.4 ± 7.2 in the third design iteration. All participants agreed that such an application is urgently needed to address the gaps in how DS information is currently organized and consumed online. Moreover, most participants thought that the graph-based visualization in ALOHA is a creative and visually appealing format to obtain health information. Conclusions: In this study, we improved a novel interactive visualization platform, ALOHA, for the general public to obtain DS-related information through two UCD design iterations. The lessons learned from the two design iterations could serve as a guide to further enhance ALOHA and the development of other knowledge graph-based applications. Our study also showed that graph-based interactive visualization is a novel and acceptable approach to end-users who are interested in seeking online health information of various domains. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Technologies like augmented reality have the potential to support teams in their everyday working environment. In this paper, we present a user centered design approach for defining requirements based on a taxonomy for augmented reality systems. Therefore, we first go into detail of the taxonomy. Afterwards we present requirements engineering based on information about the context, user, and task of an AR system. According to this information, we will gather new requirements by inducing them into the taxonomy und describe how they can be used in a user centered design process. Finally, we will present a use case based on a water treatment simulation and map the previously derived requirements to the system. Additionally, we will describe two user studies to evaluate an ambient awareness tool, generated due to those requirements. Our work shows, that the gathered requirements can be used in an early stage of the user centered design as well as after the stage of usability testing to serve as comparative variables for further usability analysis. Additionally, in terms of the user centered design process, we developed a first prototype of the ambient awareness tool, which will be evaluated in future work. © Proceedings of the Mensch und Computer 2019 Workshop on Virtual and Augmented Reality in Everyday Context (VARECo)

AB  - People with motor and communication disorders face serious challenges in interacting with computers. To enhance this functionality, new human-computer interfaces are being studied. In this work, a brain-computer interface based on the Emotiv Epoc is used to analyze human-computer interactions in cases of cerebral palsy. The Phrase-Composer software was developed to interact with the brain-computer interface. A system usability evaluation was carried out with the participation of three specialists from The Fundação Catarinense de Educação especial (FCEE) and four cerebral palsy volunteers. Even though the System Usability Scale (SUS) score was acceptable, several challenges remain. Raw electroencephalography (EEG) data were also analyzed in order to assess the user’s emotions during their interaction with the communication device. This study brings new evidences about human-computer interaction related to individuals with cerebral palsy. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Nowadays, calisthenics or commonly called street workout is one of the sports that are much in demand by the people. Street workout carries the concept of a form of exercise using one's own body weight or what is commonly called bodyweight exercise. Workout is an important activity with various benefits for the body, but not many people routinely do it. Various reasons become obstacles for people to workout, such as dense activity, do not know how the right workout routine to get the ideal body, still hesitant to start, and others. In this paper, we answer and fix those problems by designing street workout applications that apply gamification using a user-centered design approach in ISO 9241-210: 2010. The outcome of whole research is to create a high-fidelity prototype that has some usability and user experience goals and then be validated using usability testing.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The usability of computer systems used in health care is a worldwide issue. Poor usability has been reported as one of the most common problems in human-computer interaction, negatively affecting the workflow of health care. Today, the demand for home health care is increasing. It must therefore be supported with a system that is easy to learn and easy to use. The department of home health care at King Abdullah Medical Complex in Jeddah (KAMCJ) uses a semi-manual system. This research introduced a system called "TeamVisit,"which was designed to automate services and to enhance support for workflow management at the KAMCJ. The User Centered Design (UCD) method was applied to design the TeamVisit system. The system was designed in three stages: The first stage identified intended users and tasks, the second stage aimed to confirm whether the system matched user requirements, and the final stage involved initial usability testing of the TeamVisit system. The paper also summarizes the results of each stage. The paper concludes that users were satisfied with the design of the TeamVisit system, finding it easy to use.

AB  - Collaboration is a complex process that involves human and non-human factors. Although technology has improved and facilitated collaborative projects, interpretation, as the process of discovering and creating meaning, is often perceived as an individual act. This research aims to facilitate collaboration by better understanding how groups of people can make and maintain multiple interpretations. After a series of more than two dozen prototypes and 40 workshops for co-design and usability testing, the video records of the workshops have been categorized using protocol analysis and the foundations of discourse analysis. We hypothesize that the physical 3D aspect of these prototypes helps users not only in sharing their interpretations but also in co-creating them. Moreover, this is an essential finding for the next steps of this research, which will try to replicate the results of the physical models by attaching them as an interface to an online environment. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - One way to ensure good user experience of IT systems is to conduct user centred evaluation, aimed to provide feedback to IT professionals on their IT systems from the user perspective. The objective of this paper is to explore a conceptual framework, named RAMES that supports evaluators when planning, comparing and documenting user centred evaluations in a structured way. The framework structures the elements of an evaluation into five categories: Roles, Activities, Materials, Environments, and System. The framework was developed based on a theoretical analysis. Two explorative studies with 92 participants in total show that two thirds of the participants found it easy or rather easy to use the framework, and 33% find it likely that they would use the framework again. The conclusion of the studies is that frameworks such as RAMES enhance the implementation of user centred evaluations. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - With the growing awareness to learn deeper about Islam and Quran, there is an increasing trend to learn the Arabic language in Indonesia. While many institutions offer onsite learning platform to learn Arabic, the need for technology-based e-learning Arabic course is increasing as technology in Indonesia advances. The e-learning approach has to be based upon the needs of users to ensure the learning is effective. This study aims to design an online e-learning basic Arabic course using user-centered design (UCD) approach. The methodology employed in this study is mixed methods. The study covers requirements gathering, create design solution, prototyping, and evaluation. Gagne's nine instructional events are used as a theoretical basis for designing Instructional design. Evaluation is done by referring to usability testing method. This study results in an e-learning Arabic course interface that stemmed from user needs and instructional design. The final output has 17 features out of 34 identified user needs. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - With the development of technology, there are advances that help civilizations on their day-to-day activities, one of which is the implementation of e-Learning on the Final Exams. A standardized national computer-based final examination in Indonesia is called Ujian Nasional Berbasis Komputer (UNBK). Despite the fact that UNBK has been held nationwide since 2016, its interface and system have only gone through minor improvement throughout the years. To improve the usability and interface of UNBK, it is necessary to first evaluate the current interface from the users. The user evaluation was conducted using a mixed-method approach to compare and/or relate qualitative data and quantitative data. The user evaluation using an online questionnaire with the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) shows that UNBK's quality only exceeds in System Quality with a score of 75.71 out of 100. The online questionnaire data is supported with the qualitative data of contextual interviews, resulting in an affinity diagram to observe users' needs, pain points, and missing opportunities. The improved interface design according to the users' feedbacks was also tested using Usability Testing. The result of the UT shows that it has the binary task succession rate of 86.50%. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The development of information technology has impacted the education sector. The use of technology in learning is commonly called E-Learning. In the usage of E-Learning for learning, there 1are usability problems encountered from the registration process which is quite difficult, material that does not fit the user's needs, the learning process that doesn't effective, and the difficulties of finding the searched class. This study aims to produce an interface and test the results of the interface interaction design for ITB E-Learning. The approach used is human-centered design with the ISO 9241-210: 2010 methodology and Google Design Sprint. The result of this study is a high-fidelity prototype created using Adobe XD. The tests have been conducted on ITB students with usability testing and SUS Testing methods. The prototype is successful if it meets the SUS Testing value of 62.5, meets usability goals that are easy to use and can be learned easily, and user experience goals to help and satisfy the users. Based on the results of the tests conducted, there were SUS Test results of 94.17 and 5 out of 6 users rated the prototype as easy to use, easy to learn, satisfying, and assisted users in conducting learning activities.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Human-centered design is a methodology that applies an iterative participatory process that engages the end-user for whom an innovation or intervention is designed for from start to end. There is general evidence to support the use of human-centered design for development of tools to affect health behavior, but specifically for family planning provision. This study is part two of a three-phase study that uses a user-centered design methodology which uses the findings from Phase I to design, develop, and test a digital health solution to support follow-up after an induced surgical abortion. Objective: The objectives for this study were to: (1) develop a Web-based intervention based on preferences and experiences of women who underwent an abortion as measured in the formative phase of the Feasibility and Acceptability of a Mobile Technology Intervention to Support Postabortion Care Study; (2) conduct usability testing of the intervention to determine user-friendliness and appropriateness of the intervention; and (3) finalize a beta version of the Web-based intervention for pilot testing. Methods: The study design was based on the “development-evaluation-implementation” process from the Medical Research Council Framework for Complex Medical Interventions. This study is in Phase II of III and is based on user-centered design methodology. Phase I findings demonstrated that women engage with technology to assist in clinical care and they preferred a comprehensive website with email or text notifications to support follow-up care. In Phase II we collaborated with family planning experts and key stakeholders to synthesize evidence from Phase I. With them and a development partner we built a prototype. Usability testing was completed with 9 participants using a validated System Usability Scale. This was then used to refine the intervention for Phase III pilot study. This study was approved by the local Ethics board. Results: We developed a comprehensive Web-based tool called myPostCare.ca, which includes: Post-Procedure Care, Emotional Well-Being Tool, Contraception Explorer, Sexual Health, Book an Appointment, and Other Resources. Additionally, over the course of a month after the procedure, automatic email notifications were sent to women as a form of virtual follow-up support, directing them to myPostCare.ca resources. The Web-based tool was refined based on usability testing results. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that user-centered design is a useful methodology to build programs and interventions that are women-centered, specifically for abortion care. © Roopan Kaur Kaur Gill, Gina Ogilvie, Wendy V Norman, Brian Fitzsimmons, Ciana Maher, Regina Renner.

AB  - Electroencephalography is well-known for its importance in the diagnosis and treatment of mental and neurological disorders and abnormalities, being especially noted in critically ill patients who suffer a variety of cerebral injuries and altered states of consciousness. However, there is an important lack of adapted equipment and applications designed to suit the clinical and research needs. Hence, patients, physicians and researchers suffer, in most cases, from a restricted mobility due to non-portable devices and wires which keep them attached to the bed, leading to an uncomfortable patient experience or difficulties during the recording. In addition, nowadays, both physicians and researchers need to access the recordings and patient information from different places such as different units or hospitals. To solve this problem, this paper presents the design and evaluation of the high-fidelity prototype of a wireless EEG smartphone application based on a user-centred design, including expert panel guidance, paper and high-fidelity prototyping and usability testing, which confirm the accuracy of the defined context of use and the validity of the prototyped application to suit the clinical and research needs. In fact, since the EEG is the most efficient and specific way to define the epileptogenic cortex, we will focus on the possible use of the presented App in epilepsy diagnosis, which is one of the main targets in the field. © 2019, Universidad Internacional de la Rioja.

AB  - Agile and User-Centered Design (UCD) integration allows the advantages of both approaches to be taken in a hybrid method. The requirements will evolve and gradually adapt to the needs of users and customers, and UCD techniques will improve usability and User eXperience (UX) of the developed software. However, there has been much discussion about the challenges of this integration, because of the differing philosophies. User stories and use cases are the typical artifacts for specifying requirements in agile methodologies. On the other hand, prototypes, Persona, scenarios, task analysis and usability testing are UCD techniques, frequently employed in Requirements Engineering. Numerous authors have studied the best way for these techniques and artifacts to be compatible in hybrid methods. However, the different approaches of Agile and UCD make it difficult to jointly apply and manage an agile-UCD project. This article proposes User Objectives for the collection and development of requirements in an agile and user-centered project. The UOs collect the functional and non-functional requirements of the user's wishes. Completing a UO implies the orderly realization of three activities: Specification of Requirements, Presentation and Functionality. This enables, the flexible planning of an order in which to carry out activities, according to agile and UCD criteria. Moreover, the UOs are organized in different categories according to both their development and their relationship with the user. The UOs diagrams enable both the progress of the project to be visualized, thereby facilitating the modularization, prioritization and planning; and also the monitoring of the UOs evaluated with UCD techniques, as well as those that still need to be evaluated. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Background Drug therapy in pediatric patients is a complex process. Children are subject to continuous growth and variation in drug-metabolizing enzyme activity, requiring continuous adaption of dosages. In Germany, currently no publicly available database exists that provides evidence-based information on drug dosages in pediatrics. For local drug dosing support, a prototype database has been developed within the Children's Hospital, Erlangen. A user-centered development process was initiated to establish an online platform for evidence-based dosing recommendations, as well as pharmacological and pharmaceutical drug information in pediatrics. Objectives The objectives of the study were to survey the demand for such a platform and to assess the usability of the different versions of the developed system. Methods The developed prototype was evaluated in a pluralistic walkthrough with prospective end users. After a redesign, the second prototype of the online platform underwent an online usability testing based on a tailored questionnaire and the System Usability Scale (SUS) (n = 12). Results Eleven of 12 participants expressed a demand for an online platform for pediatric dosing recommendations. The majority of the participants requested the integration of extended features, such as drug-drug interaction alerts, or information on adverse effects, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. Particularly noteworthy is the demand for an online calculator; 5 of a total of 15 participants explicitly requested a calculator for dosages (based on age, weight, body surface) and glomerular filtration rate. The usability of the second prototype was rated good to excellent with a median SUS of 81.25. Conclusion Local domain experts demand an online platform for pediatric dosing recommendations. The application of the user-centered design approach enabled the development of a prototype suitable for practical use. Multiple additional required functionalities have been identified, whereby the importance of an online calculator for patient-individual dosing recommendations was particularly emphasized. © 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.

AB  - During validation of power tools, one objective is to determine the usability of the device for several applications. A common way to gain this user knowledge is to carry out tests under laboratory conditions with non-professional craftsmen, whereby a non-professional user does not work and evaluate a power tool similarly to a professional. Therefore an experimental study was conducted to investigate the possibility of training non-professionals in the professional working methods and evaluation of relevant key criteria for drywall screwdrivers. 39 subjects were divided into three groups and trained in the professional use of a drywall screwdriver. Results indicate that targeted training significantly improves the professional way of working (professional hand position p = 0.000, β = -0.764) and evaluation (testing of mass distribution p = 0.000, β = -0.731) of a drywall screwdriver. The gained knowledge can be used for the implementation of objective usability test-environments to derive specific and differentiated user-centered development potentials under laboratory conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Although severe aircraft accidents have been reduced in the last decades, the number of injuries and fatalities caused by weather phenomena leading to turbulence is still rising. Current aviation weather products are unable to provide a holistic and intuitive view of the overall weather situation, especially in terms of turbulence forecasts. This work introduces an interactive 3D prototype developed with a user-centered design approach. The prototype focuses on the visualization of significant weather charts, which are utilized during flight preparation. An online user study is conducted to compare the prototype with today's 2D paper maps. A total of 64 pilots from an internationally operating airline participated in the study. Among the major findings of the study is that the prototype significantly decreased the cognitive load, and enhanced spatial awareness and usability. To determine the spatial awareness, a novel similarity measure for spatial configurations of aviation weather data is introduced. © 2018 ACM.

AB  - Dekoruma is an Indonesia-based home and living e-Commerce with an urgency to improve the quality of service and shopping experience for its customers. This study is conducted to evaluate usability aspects of Dekoruma's current e-Commerce site and propose an alternative design to improve the usability. The methods used for data collection and analysis in this study are the mixed method approach, and the alternative design development is conducted using the User-Centered Design (UCD) approach. The quantitative data are collected through online questionnaires addressing users' demographic data and behavior in using Dekoruma website and System Usability Scale. Usability testing is conducted to collect qualitative data directly from end-users. Identified usability problems are mapped to relate interface design principles. Proposed solutions are built into a high fidelity prototype as the end result. The usability testing of the alternative design shows that most of the proposed solutions are able to solve usability problems encountered beforehand. Further improvement is still needed on product filter and product detail features. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - General Aviation flight operations have been negatively affected by the slow decreasing weather related accident rate for the last 20 years. Upon further investigation, research suggests, that poor preflight planning and a lack of aviation weather experience and knowledge may be contributing factors to the stagnant weather related accident rate. Our team developed a Preflight Weather Decision Support Tool (PWDST) to help novice pilots access, interpret, and apply weather information. We used a user-centered design process which involved an initial task analysis, low-fidelity prototyping, low-fidelity usability testing, user interviews and expert review. This study assessed and compared the perceived usability, difficulty, and the system assistance satisfaction of the PWDST. Participants (n=9) completed a usability study and a series of surveys during, as well as, after the completion of the preflight planning scenario. A series of Mann-Whitney U Tests were conducted to compare the difference between Private Pilot and Certified Flight Instructors (CFI) perceived usability, difficulty, and system assistance satisfaction ratings. Results indicated, there were no significant differences between group ratings. Overall, both groups reported above average usability, system assistance and low difficulty rating for the PWDST. Future research and possible implications are discussed. © 2019 by Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

AB  - Kinaesthetic creativity refers to the body’s ability to generate alternate futures in activities such as role-playing in participatory design workshops. This has relevance not only to the design of methods for inspiring creativity but also to the design of systems that promote engaging experiences via bodily interaction. This paper probes this creative process by studying how dancers interact with technology to generate ideas. We developed a series of parameterized interactive visuals and asked dance practitioners to use them in generating movement materials. From our study, we define a taxonomy that comprises different relationships and movement responses dancers form with the visuals. Against this taxonomy, we describe six types of interaction patterns and demonstrate how dance creativity is driven by the ability to shift between these patterns. We then propose a set of interaction design qualities to support kinaesthetic creativity. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - While usability testing can help instructors improve the design of online writing instruction (OWI), its emphasis on student-users sometimes overlooks the networked rhetorical ecologies in which those student-users operate, tilting online composition pedagogy toward neoliberal models of higher education that cater to the student-as-consumer. In response, I propose augmenting usability testing in online writing education with the theories of digital rhetoric. In the context of OWI, usability theory and digital rhetoric share a similar emphasis on the student as a user or audience, but they also have at least two key differences. First, unlike digital rhetoric, usability testing typically elides the political and ideological implications of student-users’ experiences. Second, the usability theories of Jakob Nielsen, for example, tend to view online interfaces as static objects manipulated by users. Digital rhetoric, on the other hand, sees interfaces as dynamic, real-time interactions. Although both paradigms have their advantages, I argue that integrating usability testing with the theories of digital rhetoric can add complexity to researchers’ understanding of OWI by revealing not only how students use online writing environments but also how they use them rhetorically. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The development of information technology that transforms traditional technological processes into modern ones is called digital transformation. Various industries in the world, including Indonesia, have been disrupted by digital transformation. One industry that has been disrupted by digital transformation is the application of information technology in financial services, namely financial technology in the digital payment section. The ease and convenience provided by financial technology needs to be followed by responsible use, financial technology services need to facilitate their users to have a healthy financial behavior. After conducting user research using questionnaire, users feel that the ease that comes with the application can result in consumerism. In this paper, we present the result of our observation in designing the user interactions of a financial technology mobile application added with a new feature called budget control. The user-centered design approach is used to design the high-fidelity prototype of the application based on the users' needs. The prototype is designed based on usability goals and user-experience goals defined for the users. We conduct a usability testing to evaluate the prototype using system usability scale questionnaire, single easy question questionnaire, and user interviews. The results show that the prototype fulfills the usability and user-experience goals. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Metacognitive training system (MTS) is a computer-based learning system aimed at developing students' metacognition. Metacognition is needed to develop students' self-regulation which is required for learning complex topics such as algorithm and data structure (ADS). Previously, we develop an MTS to support algorithm-learning. However, the approach tends to be technology-centered, thus, producing low usability score. Therefore, this paper proposes an incorporation of user-centered design (UCD) into the development of the MTS to produce a more usable system. As a result, new information architecture, wireframe, and user interface design are obtained. Finally, the system usability testing is conducted to compare two versions of the MTS, i.e. older and newer version. The result shows that the newer version has higher usability scale. In addition, the newer version of the MTS shows a positive impact on a real learning situation, indicated by the significant difference on students' performance between control and experiment group. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Introduction Developing an optimized and user-friendly mHealth application for patients and family members in the hospital environment presents unique challenges given the diverse patient population and patients' various states of well-being. Objective This article describes user-centered design methods and results for developing the patient and family facing user interface and functionality of MySafeCare, a safety reporting tool for hospitalized patients and their family members. Methods Individual and group usability sessions were conducted with specific testing scenarios for participants to follow to test the usability and functionality of the tool. Participants included patients, family members, and Patient and Family Advisory Council (PFAC) members. Engagement rounds were also conducted on study units and lessons learned provided additional information to the usability work. Usability results were aligned with Nielsen's Usability Heuristics. Results Eleven patients and family members and 25 PFAC members participated in usability testing and over 250 patients and family members were engaged during research team rounding. Specific themes resulting fromthe usability testing sessions influenced the changes made to the user interface design, workflow functionality, and terminology. Conclusion User-centered design should focus on workflow functionality, terminology, and user interface issues for mHealth applications. These themes illustrated issues aligned with four of Nielsen's Usability Heuristics: match between system and the real world, consistency and standards, flexibility and efficiency of use, and aesthetic and minimalist design.We identified workflow and terminology issues thatmay be specific to the use of an mHealth application focused on safety and used by hospitalized patients and their families. © 2018 Schattauer.

AB  - This paper outlines work that critically evaluates usability study design within ACI, specifically in regard to canine participants. Usability studies are an established interaction design tool and considered an important part of the design process. Often, a specific element or elements of user interfaces may be examined in a lab environment to learn more about users' habits. However, when ACI practitioners desire to gain similar understanding of animal users, issues may arise; for example, experimental design leveraged in animal cognition research may not be appropriate due to a baseline of training required for many canine interfaces. On the other hand, end users are not always available for exploratory or more targeted testing. This work examines canine participant selection in an effort to understand issues and potential solutions to participant selection for usability testing with canine users. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - The e-commerce market is projected to grow years by years, including in Indonesia. This growth was triggered by the increasing number of internet users both in the world and in Indonesia. But along with the e-commerce market grow in Indonesia, this was followed by a decline in the number of visits to the retail store. The object is an ad tech company in Indonesia that tries to increase the number of visits to the retail store. The firm uses the mobile application platform to run its business. However, according to a preliminary study, 75% of respondents said they were still having problems when using the application. Therefore we need usability testing for this application to find out how easily the mobile application is used. This study uses the usability testing method with think aloud, after scenario questionnaire (ASQ), system usability scale (SUS), and questionnaire for user interface satisfaction (QUIS). After gathered the usability results from the mobile application, this research was continued by making improvements to the user interface design of the application using the user-centered design approach and using 10 usability heuristics for user interface design and Material Design as literature in the making of usability improvements. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present the preliminary outcomes of a research which takes gradual exposure in virtual reality (VR) outside the laboratory to empower people with “hidden disabilities” breaking down their barriers towards independent living. It explores the use of VR through smartphones to practically apply gradual exposure to environment stressors that are typically found in busy spaces from one’s own safe environment. Design/methodology/approach: Aberdeen International Airport has kindly accepted to take part to this research as a case study. Following a participatory design and usability testing, a semi-controlled seven-day study was conducted among seven individuals with hidden disabilities to assess user acceptance. Findings: Results showed undeniable participants’ engagement and enthusiasm for the proposed approach, although further research is needed to increase the presence and improve the overall user experience. Research limitations/implications: The proposed research has been conducted on small cohort of participants outside of a clinical setting. Further engagement with individuals with hidden disabilities is required in order to determine the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Originality/value: This research presents a methodological and technological framework which contributes effectively to the practicality of VR exposure therapy outside of the laboratory setting, from one’s own safe place. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This article describes a co-design process in the context of user experience (UX) and usability testing and analysis of a first proof of concept of e-collaboration features based on unified communications, co-designed within an organization aiming to optimize users' communication cognitive load. An initial digital prototype with a detailed graphical interface, and simulated user narratives was established and the qualitative validation process is described and discussed. The implemented R&D process is mainly supported on user-centred design (UCD) methodology, namely action research with service design thinking method and co-design techniques. Qualitative data was gathered with concurrent think-aloud activities (CTA) stimulated by user experience expectation questions, observation notes, with integration in an eye tracking technology system. The UCD process and results are discussed, substantiating the added value due to the individual contributions and consequent usefulness of a final unified communication service for the organization. © 2018, IGI Global.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the effects of a powered exoskeleton on measures of physical and cognitive performance. Background: US warfighters carry heavy equipment into battle, and exoskeletons may reduce that burden. While exoskeletons are currently evaluated for their effects on physical performance, their cognitive effects are not currently considered. Method: Twelve military members participated in a simulated patrol task under three conditions: wearing a powered exoskeleton (PWR), an unpowered exoskeleton (UNP), and without wearing an exoskeleton (OFF). While following a confederate over obstacles at a constant pace, participants performed additional audio and visual tasks. Dependent measures included visual misses, visual reaction time, audio misses, audio reaction time, incremental lag time, and NASA-TLX scores. Results: The variability in the follow-task lag time was lowest with OFF and highest with UNP, highlighting reduced ability to maintain pace with the exoskeleton. Visual reaction time was significantly slower with PWR compared to OFF for 5 of 12 subjects. The NASA-TLX overall workload scores were lower for OFF compared to PWR and UNP. Conclusion: Efforts to understand individual variability are warranted such that exoskeleton designs can be used for a wider set of the population. While not all subjects had measurable differences in the selected performance tasks, the perception of increased workload was present across subjects. It remains to be determined what difference in reaction time would be operationally relevant for task-specific settings. Application: Findings draw attention to the need to consider “cognitive fit” and subject differences in the design and implementation of exoskeletons. © Copyright 2020, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

AB  - Singing songs can be an engaging and effective activity when learning a foreign language. In this paper, we describe a multi-language karaoke application called SLIONS: Singing and Listening to Improve Our Natural Speaking. When developing this application, we followed a user-centered design process which was informed by conducting interviews with domain experts, extensive usability testing, and reviewing existing gamified karaoke and language learning applications. The key feature of SLIONS is that we used automatic speech recognition (ASR) to provide students with personalized, granular feedback based on their singing pronunciation. We also provided multi-modal instruction: audio of music and singing tracks, video of a professional singer and translated text of lyrics to help students learn and master each song in the foreign language. To test the efficacy of SLIONS, we conducted a one-week pilot study with English and Chinese language learning students (N=15). The initial quantitative results show that our application can improve pronunciation and may improve vocabulary. In addition, the qualitative feedback from the students suggests that SLIONS is both fun to use and motivates students to practice speaking and singing in a foreign language. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - People with vision impairments (VIP) are among the most vulnerable road users in traffic. Autonomous vehicles are believed to reduce accidents but still demand some form of external communication signaling relevant information to pedestrians. Recent research on the design of vehicle-pedestrian communication (VPC) focuses strongly on concepts for a non-disabled population. Our work presents an inclusive user-centered design for VPC, beneficial for both vision impaired and seeing pedestrians. We conducted a workshop with VIP (N=6), discussing current issues in road traffic and comparing communication concepts proposed by literature. A thematic analysis unveiled two important themes: number of communicating vehicles and content (affecting duration). Subsequently, we investigated these in a second user study in virtual reality (N=33, 8 VIP) comparing the VPC between groups of abilities. We found that trust and understanding is enhanced and cognitive load reduced when all relevant vehicles communicate; high content messages also reduce cognitive load. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Assembly operators are experiencing ever-increasing cognitive loads due to increasing production complexity. Higher quality assembly instructions, with input from operators by sharing their knowledge, can reduce errors during the assembly process. This article describes two studies that investigate the human needs for a digital process that streamlines the input of operators in the creation or adaptation of work instructions in a Mixed-Model Assembly Systems. The first study consisted of contextual inquiries and semi-structured interviews and aimed to discover the high-level needs of the different roles involved in the creation process. The second study used the Wizard of Oz method to investigate which interaction methods could be suitable to provide feedback about erroneous assemblies. We found that any systems should take into consideration, among other things, current operator mobility, presence of multiple operators at a workstation and different technological skill levels as important factors to consider when developing new systems to capture operator knowledge. With respect to interaction methods, participants preferred manual input devices over gestural feedback methods. Copyright © 2019 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - One of the most commonly practiced and most powerful tools in user experience research is usability testing, a fairly straightforward and highly effective methodology for identifying barriers to use and for illuminating opportunities for making products, services, and systems more effective, efficient, and satisfying to use. Usability tests can be conducted in a variety of environments with varying degrees of formality, collecting various types of qualitative and quantitative data, and with different types of teams working with the end-users. Usability testing focuses on the product or service, not on the end-user, and is an under-utilized tool in product and service development and implementation. This chapter will describe the steps involved in planning and executing a usability study, from choosing the audience and selecting the test setting to deciding what data to collect, and it provides a framework for evaluating study choices and trade-offs in assessing products, services, and systems to help to maximize the user’s experience. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - An estimated 7.3 million hectares of forest, which is roughly the size of the country of South Africa have been lost since 1990. Reforestation, which is often considered as a best solution to overcome this problem is proven to be expensive. Despite various funding process, it still falls short of their objectives [14]. This paper analyzes the design process of mobile application for millennials to donate with or without money. Resulting application can show non-intrusive ads to the user to generate funds for restoration program. Researchers used User-centered design by Donald Arthur Norman to design and develop the product [9] and applied the principles of psychology of interaction design and gamification to increase the user engagement. Personalization features are used to put user in control on how and when they see ads. The usability testing of the app shows positive feedbacks and yields good result (1.246) in User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) by Hinderks et al. © 2020 Owner/Author.

AB  - One of the more demanding aspects of formal evaluations in user-centered system design is the underlying requirement for an experimental platform that accurately reflects the functionality being tested and captures relevant user performance data. While we are unaware of any truly turn-key solutions for avoiding many of the inherent costs associated with the iterative cycle of user-centered system development and formal testing, in our mediated multitasking research, we have found that a multi-application host environment, instrumented for user tracking and a playback function for reviewing what individuals attended to, experienced, and did during the task-performance segments of interaction studies, could be implemented as a reusable infrastructure of services and control functions. In this short paper, we introduce the Testbed Framework System, a flexible and extensible software platform for use in the development and conduct of formal usability testing, and outline a number of its core functions and capabilities. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.

AB  - Nowadays, competition in business world is very tight. Each company must give the best service to the customer. This matter also occurs in travel agency. In order to win the competition in national and global market travel agencies need to provide comprehensive services such as providing tour guide service application that facilitate tourists in traveling. In this research, we proposed an implementation of user experience design concept in building a tour guide service application by using Discovery, Formative and Evaluative method. This application was built to answer tourist's needs, namely: List of tour guides and its profile, navigate to tourism destinations, etc. Tourist's needs were collected through a focus group, user interview and contextual inquiry. After collecting data, the formative method was implemented to build an early design. After that, the application was evaluated to measure the success rate of the application using usability walkthrough testing and to measure the effectiveness using usability testing. From usability walkthrough testing we found that users are succeeded to do all determined tasks which means they understood the all flows of the application system. In effectiveness measurement, the evaluation resulted in level 1 and 2, which means user can use this application easily. Generally based on the evaluation result, UXD concept was successfully implemented in tour guide service application. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Visual impairment can profoundly impact well-being and social advancement. Current solutions for accessing graphical information fail to provide an affordable, user-friendly collaborative platform for visually impaired and sighted people to work together. Therefore, sighted users tend to have low expectations from visually impaired people while working in a team. Hence, visually impaired people feel discouraged to participate in a mixed population collaborative environment. Consequently, their generative capabilities remain devalued. In this paper, we propose an audio-haptic enabled tool (Drawxi) for free-form sketching and sharing simple diagrams (processes, workflows, ideas, perspectives, etc.). It provides a common platform for visually-impaired and sighted people to work together by communicating each other's ideas visually. Thus, enabling the discovery of generative capabilities in a hands-on way. We relied upon participatory research methods (Contextual inquiry, Co-Design) involving visually impaired participants throughout the design process. We evaluated our proposed design through usability testing which revealed that collaboration between visually impaired and sighted people benefits from the use of common tools and platforms. Thereby, enhancing the degree of their participation in a collaborative environment and quality of co-creation activities. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Many individuals who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing (DHH) in the U.S. have lower English language literacy levels than their hearing peers, which creates a barrier to access web content for these users. In the present study we determine a usable interface experience for authoring sentences (or multi-sentence messages) in ASL (American Sign Language) using the EMBR (Embodied Agents Behavior Realizer) animation platform. Three rounds of iterative designs were produced through participatory design techniques and usability testing, to refine the design, based on feedback from 8 participants familiar with creating ASL animations. Later, a usability testing session was conducted with four participants on the final iteration of the designs. We found that participants expressed a preference for a “timeline” layout for arranging words to create a sentence, with a dual view of the word-level and the sub-word “pose” level. This paper presents the details of the design stages of the new GUI, the results, and directions for future work. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - One of the most significant disabilities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) includes a delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language. Approximately half of those on the autism spectrum are functionally non-verbal or minimally verbal and will not develop sufficient natural speech or writing to meet their daily communication needs. These individuals receive intervention in the area of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) using mobile technologies. AAC services ideally should be provided starting at an early age but many young learners experience some degree of difficulty in gross and fine motor functioning that prevents accessing and benefitting from mobile AAC applications. A suite of evidence-based iPhone® applications, SPEAKall! Lite© and SPEAKplay!©, was developed to help learners with ASD (a) acquire initial speech and language skills, and (b) train critical gestures needed to fully access mobile touch screen devices. SPEAKplay! trains the performance of gestures including Directed and Sustained Touch, Drag and Drop, and Vertical and Horizontal Swipe through a gamification approach. Serious game design principles guided the creation of three arcade-style games including Pop the Bubbles, Fly the Rocket, and Feed the Dino. Initial usability testing with experienced AAC practitioners indicated SPEAKplay! to be a potentially viable intervention tool. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Rumah Belajar is a free web-based application which can be used as a supplementary learning platform for students in Indonesia. Since its release, there has not been any research on its usability. To increase the satisfaction and comfort of the users, research about usability, evaluation is needed. This research is conducted to better understand the user needs and analyze the flaws of the application. Evaluation was done using a questionnaire and a system usability scale as the quantitative method along with usability testing and a contextual interview as the qualitative method. Through the user-centered design, research involved the users to make sure that the application is aligned with the users' expectations. The results of the research suggest that the usability of the Rumah Belajar application needs to be improved. The design is made in the form of a prototype that will solve the raised issues. The designed prototype was tested on the users through usability testing. After being tested, the new suggested design could solve the majority of the usability issues. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to explore how users react to certain gestures (e.g., swipe, scroll, or tap) for certain use cases. More specifically, the goal is to explore and suggest guidelines to user experience (UX) designers when choosing gestures for specific use cases on a smartphone application. Building on the Task-technology fit theory, we are specifically interested in the degree of alignment between gestures and each mobile use case. We hypothesize that some gestures are better aligned with certain use cases because they require less cognitive effort than others. In other words, certain gestures are likely to become so natural for users that they do not have to consciously invest effort to accomplish these gestures. Likewise, we hypothesize that the emotional valence of gestures will be affected by the use case. To attain this objective, a lab-experiment was conducted with 20 participants, where cognitive load and emotional valence were measured. Results suggest that the combination of gestures and use cases have an impact on the user cognitive load and valence. These findings contribute to human-computer interaction (HCI) research by providing insights to help user experience (UX) designers select appropriate gestures. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The authors, an instructor and students, describe our practice of user-centered design on three levels: in the design and structure of an advanced undergraduate course in which we all participated, in student projects designed during the course, and in our reflections on the course presented here. We argue that principles of user-centered design can and should be more than course concepts and assignments; they can be core practices of the course that hold both students and teachers accountable for the impacts of their rhetorical choices. We offer a model for other teacher-scholars looking to involve students in the design of their courses and in writing together about their work. © 2018

AB  - Dietary supplements (DS) are widely used. However, consumers know little about the safety and efficacy of DS. There is a growing interest in accessing health information online; however, online health information, especially information on DSs, is scattered with varying levels of quality. We prototyped a web application, ALOHA, with interactive graph-based visualizations to facilitate users' browsing of the integrated DIetary Supplement Knowledge base (iDISK) curated from scientific resources, following an iterative user-centered design (UCD) process. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Objectives âImproving the usability of electronic health records (EHR) continues to be a focus of clinicians, vendors, researchers, and regulatory bodies. To understand the impact of usability redesign of an existing, site-configurable feature, we evaluated the user interface (UI) used to screen for depression, alcohol and drug misuse, fall risk, and the existence of advance directive information in ambulatory settings. Methods âAs part of a quality improvement project, based on heuristic analysis, the existing UI was redesigned. Using an iterative, user-centered design process, several usability defects were corrected. Summative usability testing was performed as part of the product development and implementation cycle. Clinical quality measures reflecting rolling 12-month rates of screening were examined over 8 months prior to the implementation of the redesigned UI and 9 months after implementation. Results âSummative usability testing demonstrated improvements in task time, error rates, and System Usability Scale scores. Interrupted time series analysis demonstrated significant improvements in all screening rates after implementation of the redesigned UI compared with the original implementation. Conclusion âUser-centered redesign of an existing site-specific UI may lead to significant improvements in measures of usability and quality of patient care. © 2020 Royal Society Publishing.

AB  - The modern hospital bed is a sophisticated medical device, and its users represent a diversity of abilities and needs. To develop a new bed, Hill-Rom studied these users in nearly 500 hr of observation across 29 hospital units. Focus groups were used to evaluate early concepts, and formative usability testing included over 130 users to evaluate design prototypes. This research and testing resulted in the development of the Centrella bed, which includes new features to address patient satisfaction, patient safety, and caregiver efficiency. The resulting design is the winner of the 2017 Stanley Caplan User Centered Design Award. © 2019 by Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

AB  - The advancements of smartphone technology have led to a significant growth of smartphone weather applications (i.e. apps) on the market. Due to the high risk and time-critical situations associated with severe weather conditions (e.g. floods, tornados, and thunderstorms), designing weather apps to consider users’ needs is critical for improving product usability. This paper employs a user-centered design (UCD) approach to investigate a sample of end users’ perceptions regarding the usability of smartphone weather apps. Focus group responses analyzed with a thematic analysis approach revealed four main themes representing key usability principles and design specifications. The four themes were (1) user cognitive load, (2) effectiveness,(3) efficiency of use, and (4) user perceptions. Several recommendations were suggested based on the findings which might assist developers in designing highly interactive and usable apps leading to increased user satisfaction. © 2019 by Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

AB  - Background: Concussion is a common injury among Canadian children and adolescents that leads to a range of neurobehavioral deficits. However, noticeable gaps continue to exist in the management of pediatric concussion, with poor health outcomes associated with the inadequate application of best practice guidelines. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the development and assess the usability of a mobile phone app to aid youth in the self-management of concussion. A secondary objective was to assess the usefulness of the app. Methods: An agile user-centered design approach was used to develop the technology, followed by a formative lab-based usability study for assessment and improvement proposals. Youths aged 10 to 18 years with a history of concussion and health care professionals involved in concussion management were recruited. This study included participants performing 12 tasks with the mobile phone app while using the think aloud protocol and the administration of the System Usability Scale (SUS), posttest questionnaire, and a semistructured interview. Results: A mobile phone app prototype called NeuroCare, an easily accessible pediatric concussion management intervention that provides easy access to expert-informed concussion management strategies and helps guide youth in self-managing and tracking their concussion recovery, was developed. A total of 7 youths aged between 10 and 18 years with a history of concussion and 7 health care professionals were recruited. The mean SUS score was 81.9, mean task success rates were greater than 90% for 92% (11/12) of the tasks, 92% (11/12) of tasks had a total error frequency of less than 11 errors, and mean task completion times were less than 2 min for 100% of the tasks. Conclusions: Results suggest that participants rated this app as highly usable, acceptable to users, and that it may be useful in helping youth self-manage concussion. © Harminder Sandhu, Katherine Wilson, Nick Reed, Alex Mihailidis.

AB  - Introduction: Self-management of chronic diseases using mobile health (mHealth) systems and applications is becoming common. Current evaluation methods such as formal usability testing can be very costly and time-consuming; others may be more efficient but lack a user focus. We propose an enhanced cognitive walkthrough (CW) method, the user-centered CW (UC-CW), to address identified deficiencies in the original technique and perform a beginning validation with think aloud protocol (TA) to assess its effectiveness, efficiency and user acceptance in a case study with diabetes patient users on a mHealth self-management application. Materials and methods: A total of 12 diabetes patients at University of Utah Health, USA, were divided into UC-CW and think aloud (TA) groups. The UC-CW method included: making the user the main evaluator for detecting usability problems, having a dual domain facilitator, and using three other improved processes: validated task development, higher level tasks and a streamlined evaluation process. Users interacted with the same mHealth application for both methods. Post-evaluation assessments included the NASA RTLX instrument and a set of brief interview questions. Results: Participants had similar demographic characteristics. A total of 26 usability problems were identified with the UC-CW and 20 with TA. Both methods produced similar ratings: severity across all views (UC-CW = 2.7 and TA = 2.6), numbers of problems in the same views (Main View [UC-CW = 11, TA = 10], Carbohydrate Entry View [UC-CW = 4, TA = 3] and List View [UC-CW = 3, TA = 3]) with similar heuristic violations (Match Between the System and Real World [UC-CW = 19, TA = 16], Consistency and Standards [UC-CW = 17, TA = 15], and Recognition Rather than Recall [UC-CW = 13, TA = 10]). Both methods converged on eight usability problems, but the UC-CW group detected five critical issues while the TA group identified two. The UC-CW group identified needed personalized features for patients’ disease needs not identified with TA. UC-CW was more efficient on average time per identified usability problem and on the total evaluation process with patients. NASA RTLX scores indicated that participants experienced the UC-CW half as cognitively demanding. Common themes from interviews indicated the UC-CW as enjoyable and easy to perform while TA was considered somewhat awkward and more cognitively challenging. Conclusions: UC-CW was effective for finding severe, recurring usability problems and it highlighted the need for personalized user features. The method was also efficient and had high user acceptance. These results indicate UC-CW's utility and user acceptance in evaluating a mHealth self-management application. It provides an additional usability evaluation technique for researchers. © 2019

AB  - Objective: To explore user-centered design methods currently implemented during development of lower limb wearable robots and how they are utilized during different stages of product development. Background: Currently, there appears to be a lack of standardized frameworks for evaluation methods and design requirements to implement effective user-centered design for safe and effective clinical or ergonomic system application. Method: Responses from a total of 191 experts working in the field of lower limb exoskeletons were analyzed in this exploratory survey. Descriptive statistics were used to present responses and measures of frequency, and chi-square tests were used to contrast the answers of respondents who identified as clinicians versus engineers. Results: A vast majority of respondents involve users in their development, in particular at the initial and iterative stages, although some differences were found between disciplines. A variety of methods and metrics are used to capture feedback from users and test devices, and although valuable, some methods used may not be based on validated measures. Guidelines regarding tests on safety of exoskeletons also lack standardization. Conclusion: There seems to be a consensus among experts regarding the importance of a user-centered approach in exoskeleton development; however, standardized frameworks with regard to appropriate testing methods and design approaches are lacking. Such frameworks should consider an interdisciplinary focus on the needs and safety of the intended user during each iteration of the process. Application: This exploratory study provides an overview of current practice among engineers and clinicians regarding the user-centered design of exoskeletons. Limitations and recommendations for future directions are identified. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Not all topics within a knowledge graph are represented at the same depth, which might lead to biased conclusions derived from the graph. Tools have been created in an effort to highlight knowledge imbalances, one of which is ProWD, built to analyze imbalances in the Wikidata knowledge graph. However, as often found, the usability aspect of Semantic Web tools is commonly overlooked, resulting in their limited acceptance. In this paper, we utilize the standard approach to improve usability, i.e., the User-Centered Design (UCD), for ProWD. We employ the full range of steps of UCD to improve the user experience of ProWD despite the complex nature of knowledge graph concepts underlying ProWD. The result of the ProWD redesign is then evaluated using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) scores, as well as the task success rate and completion time, suggesting that the overall usability of ProWD has successfully improved.

AB  - The implementation of evaluation methods with the aim to gain knowledge of the perceived quality aspects is a challenging task because of versatile disruptive factors on the users’ cognition. Commonly known disruptive factors like the different level of experience in the usage of a system or the publicity of a brand name are considered in research approaches only marginally. This becomes even more important when the evaluated system stays in direct interaction with the evaluator and an increase of external influences can be expected. On the example of a system with strong user interaction, a research approach for an objective evaluation of quality aspects was developed with cordless drills. An experiment has been carried out with 50 craftsmen which are divided into two groups, whereby the first of which will be given original labeled and the other blinded cordless drills for rating the application quality. Evaluation was divided into a preliminary test and a practical test phase, in which selected applications were performed. Results for the preliminary evaluation of the cordless drills indicate a significant brand influence with a strong positive effect on well-known (p<.001, r=0.492, +30.7%) and a negative effect on unknown brands (p=0.029, r=0.309, -17.2%). Practical usage of the devices leads to a significant change of ratings (well-know brand: p=0.007, r=0.378, +1.9%; unknown brand: p=0.053, r=0.274, +12%). Using paired sample t-test it can be shown that the practical use of cordless drills reduces variances in evaluation and ratings become more precise. Relevance for industry: Given approaches can be used in industry to conduct field studies with real users and benchmark systems to identify new development goals (quality aspects) for user-optimized products that are not affected by disruptive factors such as the brand name. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We employed an agile, user-centered approach to the design of a clinical decision support tool in our prior integrated clinical prediction rule study, which achieved high adoption rates. To understand if applying this user-centered process to adapt clinical decision support tools is effective in improving the use of clinical prediction rules, we examined utilization rates of a clinical decision support tool adapted from the original integrated clinical prediction rule study tool to determine if applying this user-centered process to design yields enhanced utilization rates similar to the integrated clinical prediction rule study. MATERIALS & METHODS: We conducted pre-deployment usability testing and semi-structured group interviews at 6 months post-deployment with 75 providers at 14 intervention clinics across the two sites to collect user feedback. Qualitative data analysis is bifurcated into immediate and delayed stages; we reported on immediate-stage findings from real-time field notes used to generate a set of rapid, pragmatic recommendations for iterative refinement. Monthly utilization rates were calculated and examined over 12 months. RESULTS: We hypothesized a well-validated, user-centered clinical decision support tool would lead to relatively high adoption rates. Then 6 months post-deployment, integrated clinical prediction rule study tool utilization rates were substantially lower than anticipated based on the original integrated clinical prediction rule study trial (68%) at 17% (Health System A) and 5% (Health System B). User feedback at 6 months resulted in recommendations for tool refinement, which were incorporated when possible into tool design; however, utilization rates at 12 months post-deployment remained low at 14% and 4% respectively. DISCUSSION: Although valuable, findings demonstrate the limitations of a user-centered approach given the complexity of clinical decision support. CONCLUSION: Strategies for addressing persistent external factors impacting clinical decision support adoption should be considered in addition to the user-centered design and implementation of clinical decision support. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Gamification is increasingly being applied in education to engage and motivate learners. Yet the application of gaming elements can be problematic because it can have a negative effect on cognitive load (CL) and on working memory (WM). This is a particular issue for children with learning disabilities who suffer from deficits in working memory. While studies have explored the relationship between gamification and cognitive load, there is little research to address the management of cognitive load in gamified learning applications for children with learning disabilities. This study is suggesting a framework based on existing guidelines derived from HCI concepts and cognitive load theories to design user-centered gamified applications for children with learning disabilities to exploit their limited WM capacity and manage cognitive load. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Background: Nearly half of US adults with diagnosed hypertension have uncontrolled blood pressure. Clinical inertia may contribute, including patient-physician uncertainty about how variability in blood pressures impacts overall control. Better information display may support clinician-patient hypertension decision making through reduced cognitive load and improved situational awareness. Methods: A multidisciplinary team employed iterative user-centered design to create a blood pressure visualization EHR prototype that included patient-generated blood pressure data. An attitude and behavior survey and 10 focus groups with patients (N = 16) and physicians (N = 24) guided iterative design and confirmation phases. Thematic analysis of qualitative data yielded insights into patient and physician needs for hypertension management. Results: Most patients indicated measuring home blood pressure, only half share data with physicians. When receiving home blood pressure data, 88% of physicians indicated entering gestalt averages as text into clinical notes. Qualitative findings suggest that including a data visualization that included home blood pressures brought this valued data into physician workflow and decision-making processes. Data visualization helps both patients and physicians to have a fuller understanding of the blood pressure 'story' and ultimately promotes the activated engaged patient and prepared proactive physician central to the Chronic Care Model. Both patients and physicians expressed concerns about workflow for entering and using home blood pressure data for clinical care. Conclusions: Our user-centered design process with physicians and patients produced a well-received blood pressure visualization prototype that includes home blood pressures and addresses patient-physician information needs. Next steps include evaluating a recent EHR visualization implementation, designing annotation functions aligned with users' needs, and addressing additional stakeholders' needs (nurses, care managers, caregivers). This significant innovation has potential to improve quality of care for hypertension through better patient-physician understanding of control and goals. It also has the potential to enable remote monitoring of patient blood pressure, a newly reimbursed activity, and is a strong addition to telehealth efforts. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The aim of this study is to design and develop a user-centered, smart-tool prototype that could be used to assist teachers to practice differentiated instruction (DI) in their classrooms. This study also demonstrates how user-centered design process for the development of teacher’s tools might be useful to identify system features and to prioritize decisions of the features by making teachers participate in all evaluation processes. For the user-centered design approach, first, conceptually designed personas and scenarios were applied based on user needs and system requirements identified in our previous study. Then, three rounds of iterative evaluations including scenario reviews, claim analysis, and usability testing were conducted by the teachers. Scenario reviews with teachers provided designers with an opportunity to better understand teachers’ tasks related to DI, and claim analysis helped to make priorities on the features that designers cannot decide. This study has implications on issues related to student’s private information on smart-technology for instruction. Another implication of this study is to demonstrate the merits of different evaluation methodologies, applied and demonstrated here, in order for designers to utilize the methods when designing and developing new tools with future technologies in educational contexts. Finally, through three rounds evaluations, it was validated that the use of smart technologies, such as the developed smart-tool in this study, can promote differentiated instruction in action. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In this paper, we present a data-driven approach to enable the creation of evidence-based usability test scenarios. By utilising product usage data to create usability test scenarios, we aim to improve the reliability of the test results and to provide better insights into product usability. The approach consists of four elements: the collection of product usage data, the transformation of these data into logs of user activities, the creation of models of user behaviour, and the guided creation of usability test scenarios based on the models. We discuss the challenges that can be encountered when applying this approach based on our experiences with two case studies in product development. We have created a prototype scenario planning tool and performed a preliminary evaluation of the tool with usability engineers working at Philips Healthcare. The evaluation shows that tool-supported evidence-based usability test creation would be valuable in their daily work. © 2019, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - Background Medical errors in blood product orders and administration are common, especially for pediatric patients. A failure modes and effects analysis in our health care system indicated high risk from the electronic blood ordering process. Objectives There are two objectives of this study as follows: (1) To describe differences in the design of the original blood product orders and order sets in the system (original design), new orders and order sets designed by expert committee (DEC), and a third-version developed through user-centered design (UCD). (2) To compare the number and type of ordering errors, task completion rates, time on task, and user preferences between the original design and that developed via UCD. Methods A multidisciplinary expert committee proposed adjustments to existing blood product order sets resulting in the DEC order set. When that order set was tested with front-line users, persistent failure modes were detected, so orders and order sets were redesigned again via formative usability testing. Front-line users in their native clinical workspaces were observed ordering blood in realistic simulated scenarios using a think-aloud protocol. Iterative adjustments were made between participants. In summative testing, participants were randomized to use the original design or UCD for five simulated scenarios. We evaluated differences in ordering errors, time on task, and users' design preference with two-sample t -tests. Results Formative usability testing with 27 providers from seven specialties led to 18 changes made to the DEC to produce the UCD. In summative testing, error-free task completion for the original design was 36%, which increased to 66% in UCD (30%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.9-57%; p = 0.03). Time on task did not vary significantly. Conclusion UCD led to substantially different blood product orders and order sets than DEC. Users made fewer errors when ordering blood products for pediatric patients in simulated scenarios when using the UCD orders and order sets compared with the original design. © 2019 American Institute of Physics Inc..

AB  - Antenatal Care (ANC) service performed by midwives in Primary Health Care (PHC) became more efficient through mobile health (mHealth) implementation. However, no work has yet been conducted toward the development of the technologies for integrating the service since midwives provide not only in-house clinic service but also community works such as home visit and site clinic. The objective of the study was to design a mobile health application using user-centered needs approach to consider the functionality and usability of the users. We conducted a case study in South Tangerang, an urban city of Banten Province, Indonesia using in-depth interview for prospective users and collected usability testing of mock-up mobile application through System Usability Scale (SUS) among 20 respondents. Functional features were identified namely: 1) pregnancy register such as personal identity, spouse identity, and ANC content, 2) pregnancy monitoring such as high-risk pregnancy, diagnosis, and maternal status. As conclusion, this is the first study to design a mobile Health for integrating ANC service based on UCD framework. The study indicates that UCD is found as useful guidance for designing a monitoring and registration mHealth application named SIMORI for integrating ANC service in primary health care. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - At the moment, healthcare services, such as dental clinics, have the same opportunities as other industries of utilizing ERP systems to escalate their activities. Unfortunately, ERP systems still have to go through problems associated with clinical personnel, who interact with the system using its UI, before it can be fully utilized. To solve this problem, a user interface redesign was needed so that ERP could fully satisfy the needs of clinical personnel. Therefore, design thinking was chosen and used as the design approach with its user-oriented nature that has been proven with various forms of successful interventions within healthcare services. The prototype of the redesigned user interface was made to visually deliver most of the previously unmet needs from personnel. Furthermore, by incorporating UT and PSSUQ survey as measurement instruments into the design thinking, researchers were able to justify the prototype for its improvement in usability after scoring lower time on tasks while preventing some errors, also for increased satisfaction perceived by users compared to the current UI. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Crowd-based open innovation communities have received increasing attention, based on the premise that leveraging the power and diversity of the crowd can lead to innovative outcomes. However, we still know little about how work is coordinated over time in this context, especially as the innovation process moves from idea generation to elaboration. Based on literature and theories of coordination and collaboration in traditional creative contexts and on emergent evidence from research on crowd work, we develop hypotheses about the unique interaction patterns that characterize co-creation and how these patterns impact, over time, submission quality. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a study of a crowd-based open innovation platform. We found that, in general, the diversity of contributors increased over time, but for high quality submissions, the number of contributors decreased and a small group of involved people became more dominant in providing feedback. Further, we observe that the creators of more successful submissions, while not dominating the discussion, were particularly engaged in the discussions in later stages. Our work contributes to understanding the temporal dynamics in open innovation communities by providing evidence that successful interaction patterns vary depending on the phase of the project. © International Conference on Information Systems 2018, ICIS 2018.All rights reserved.

AB  - In the 21st Century, technology has become a part of almost everyone's lives in the world and will keep on evolving. Therefore, people's way of thinking must be able to follow the technology evolution. Since 2006, Computational Thinking (CT) has been stated as a fundamental skill for everyone, not just for computer scientists. The concept of CT is very important to be taught to children so that it can be applied as early as possible. In the digital era that is happening now, the suitable CT learning for children is in the form of digital game as an application on smartphones. The interaction and interface of this application is designed using user-centered design approach in ISO 9241210:2010. In order to make this application useful for children, it should be effective to use, easy to learn, and enjoyable. Those three things are the usability and user experience goals of this application. Usability testing is conducted to validate the achievement of the goals by using several metrics, such as completion rate, Single Ease Question (SEQ), System Usability Scale (SUS), and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory for interest/enjoyment subscale. The completion rate is 97,4 %/100% for usability goal effective to use, the SEQ score is 6,12/7 and the SUS score is 70,5/100 for usability goal learnability, and the IMI interest/enjoyment subscale score is 6,02/7 for user experience goal enjoyable. This application has achieved the usability and user experience goals because all the scores from the measurements using those four metrics are above the average.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - There are a lot of growing e-Commerce companies in Indonesia with their own application that has been used by millions of users. One of the important informational channels in e-Commerce application is push notifications, of which its sole purpose is to push and deliver information to its users. The problem is that only a limited number of customers open push notifications immediately upon receiving. This research was conducted to find the key factors that determine user's desires to open push notification and to improve user's experiences when receiving push notifications. User-Centered Design and a mixed-method approach were used on this research, utilizing surveys and contextual interviews for data collection. Tokopedia is one of e-Commerce companies in Indonesia. Tokopedia iOS application is used in this research as a case study as Tokopedia is one of the most used e-Commerce application in Indonesia. The research findings show that the key determining factors are contents of the push notifications and time and frequency of receipt. Based on the results, a prototype has been designed in a high-fidelity form and was subsequently evaluated using the Usability Testing method. The evaluation show that the task success rate of said prototype is 88.3 percent, and accordingly it could be the solution to this problems. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Deaf and hard-of-hearing people have limitations in communication, especially on aspects of language, intelligence, and social adjustment. To communicate, deaf people use sign language or lipreading. For normal people, it is very difficult to use sign language. They have to memorize many hand signs. Therefore, lipreading is a necessary for communication between normal and deaf people. In Indonesia, there is still few education media for deaf people to learn lipreading. To overcome this challenge, we develop a lipreading educational media to help deaf and hard-of-hearing to learn Bahasa Indonesia, called BacaBicara. User-Centered Design (UCD) is implemented to design the application and to analyze the constraints and conceptual models for the needs of users. This conceptual model uses the picture, lipreading video, text, and sign language to help the users understand the contents. The High fidelity prototype was implemented for evaluating usability testing. Based on the evaluation of the application, the results show that the prototype matches the usability goals and the user experience. © 2019 Kassel University Press GmbH.

AB  - Designing an effective user interface (UI) of e-Learning system that has excellent usability is a crucial activity in e-Learning development. Nowadays, user-centered design (UCD) is a popular method used for developing the user interfaces of e-Learning systems and modules. This systematic literature review offers a helicopter view of the state-of-the-art applications of UCD for designing the UI of e-Learning systems. This study reviewed 17 works of literature from 2015 until early 2020 to identify how research in the development of e-Learning system applied UCD and its impacts on the usability of the developed systems. This study found that many e-Learning system development projects applied UCD differently in terms of methods and user involvement. The most popular methods integrated with the UCD are questionnaires, interviews, high-fidelity prototyping, and usability testing. The study also found that some of the projects that used UCD with involving the users in multiple phases produced a design with good usability. Furthermore, this study suggests that both learners and subject matter experts should be involved in the design process of e-Learning system to acquire both excellent UI and effective learning process.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: People with severe or profound hearing loss face daily communication problems mainly due to the language barrier between themselves and the hearing community. Their hearing deficiency, as well as their use of sign language, often makes it difficult for them to use and understand spoken language. Cyprus is amongst the top 5 European countries with a relatively high proportion of registered deaf people (0.12 per cent of the population: GUL, 2010). However, lack of technological and financial support to the Deaf Community of Cyprus leaves the Cypriot deaf people unsupported and marginalised. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: This study implemented user-centred design methods to explore the communication needs and requirements of Cypriot deaf people and develop a functional prototype of a mobile app to help them to communicate more effectively with hearing people. A total of 76 deaf adults were involved in various stages of the research. This paper presents the participatory design activities (N=8) and results of usability testing (N=8). Findings: The study found that users were completely satisfied with the mobile app and, in particular, they liked the use of Cypriot Sign Language (CSL) videos of a real person interpreting hearing people’s speech in real time and the custom onscreen keyboard to allow faster selection of text input. Originality/value: Despite advances in communication aid technologies, there is currently no technology available that supports CSL or real-time speech to sign language conversion for the deaf people of Cyprus. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Chatbot-based conversational commerce which allows buyers to do online shopping by conversing with chatbot through messaging application has been growing in the e-commerce industry. However, based on studies conducted in this paper, findings show that interaction design of the existing conversational commerce are still lacking in various areas. Therefore, an interaction and interface design for chatbot-based conversational commerce are developed in this study using user-centered design. The outcome of this study is a prototype that fulfills the usability goal and the user experience goal defined for chatbot-based conversational commerce on mobile platform especially for Indonesian users. We conduct usability testing to evaluate the prototype. The results show that the prototype fulfills the defined usability goals and user experience goals as 100% users agree that the prototype is effective to use, efficient to use, easy to learn, enjoyable and helpful, although only 83.3% users agree that the prototype is safe to use. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Social media has become an important part in the way of people communicate. One of the most popular social media in Indonesia is Twitter. Twitter users can send short messages called tweets to a set of other users who receive their messages called followers. Twitter users can also manage their tweets preferences using content preferences feature to set what content they want to see on their timeline. After doing a research using questionnaire method, some problems which are related to content preferences were found. One of the problems that users find using the feature is that they often see tweets they are not interested in seeing such as negative tweets that contain sensitive topic and spam. Twitter has mute feature to anticipate this problem by hiding tweets that contain specific keyword and sent by specific user. But user research shows that the mute feature is not effective enough to hide tweets that do not match to user's preferences. In this paper, we answer and fix those problems by redesigning Twitter's content preferences feature using user-centered design approach in ISO 9241-210:2010. The outcome of this whole research is to create high-fidelity prototype that has some usability and user experience goals and later be validated using usability testing. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The incidence of diabetes has increased dramatically in recent years and this trend is expected to continue. It is essential for the therapy of diabetes that patients keep a diary. However, diary keeping is often incomplete and digitally supported diaries are poorly accepted by older patients. With the help of focus groups, we collected requirements for a digital diabetes diary and implemented them using a LiveScribe pen. This digitally augmented pen allows you to keep the diary traditionally on paper and still offer digital support. By digitizing an already known process, our solution achieves a high level of acceptance even among older people. The evaluation was carried out with the help of the TAM model and was used to quantify the effects of user factors. Typical predictors of acceptance do not work in our model, which we see as an indication that our pen is not perceived as technology in the classical sense. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Background: A pharmacogenomic clinical decision support tool (PGx-CDS) for thiopurine medications can help physicians incorporate pharmacogenomic results into prescribing decisions by providing up-to-date, real-time decision support. However, the PGx-CDS user interface may introduce errors and promote alert fatigue. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a prototype of a PGx-CDS user interface for thiopurine medications with user-centered design methods. Methods: This study had two phases: In phase I, we conducted qualitative interviews to assess providers' information needs. Interview transcripts were analyzed through a combination of inductive and deductive qualitative analysis to develop design requirements for a PGx-CDS user interface. Using these requirements, we developed a user interface prototype and evaluated its usability (phase II). Results: In total, 14 providers participated: 10 were interviewed in phase I, and seven providers completed usability testing in phase II (3 providers participated in both phases). Most (90%) participants were interested in PGx-CDS systems to help improve medication efficacy and patient safety. Interviews yielded 11 themes sorted into two main categories: 1) health care providers' views on PGx-CDS and 2) important design features for PGx-CDS. We organized these findings into guidance for PGx-CDS content and display. Usability testing of the PGx-CDS prototype showed high provider satisfaction. Conclusion: This is one of the first studies to utilize a user-centered design approach to develop and assess a PGx-CDS interface prototype for Thiopurine Methyltransferase (TPMT). This study provides guidance for the development of a PGx-CDS, and particularly for biomarkers such as TPMT. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Students can enter IT degrees with only a general idea of available career pathways and career options. Students often select an IT degree based on intrinsic interest in IT [8], however their career decisions can be based on misconceptions about the industry. The ‘Day in the Life’ application seeks to provide industry and career knowledge to first- and second-year IT students through an informative resource detailing the daily activities of various IT professionals, with a focus upon individual video interviews and organisation-related content. Usability testing was conducted to answer the question: To what level does this site alone change students’ perspectives or understanding of day-to-day work in the IT industry? While revisions are recommended, overall student feedback indicates that the application has a positive effect on student knowledge, understanding, and career confidence. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - This chapter discusses the role of usability testing in evaluating technologies with older adults (aged 65+). We draw on our experience of designing and evaluating usability tests and on a critical engagement with the standard literature to present a set of strategies to design, implement, conduct, and analyze usability testing. Some strategies include choosing suitable locations to conduct the usability test, designing warm-up questions, selecting an appropriate usability testing technique (i.e., Co-Discovery), and using mixed-methods approaches. Additionally, we reflect on challenges encountered in the field from recruitment limitations to handling impression management efforts by participants. To understand and address these issues, we rely on cross-disciplinary insights and approaches from Human– Computer Interaction and sociology. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.

AB  - New technology always needs validation in terms of stakeholder acceptance and usability. This challenge also applies in the case of technology for reminiscence therapy for people with dementia. We are looking at how to overcome this situation and identifying how technology can support reminiscence therapy. Therefore, we are conducting user research with people with dementia and their caregivers, prototyping multimedia approaches and testing for efficacy and acceptance of these approaches. Reminiscence therapy is an important aspect in the care for people with dementia as it improves their wellbeing. So far, mostly conventional, analog media is used for this purpose. Our qualitative research suggests that technology can enrich traditional reminiscence therapy, foster conversations, and support positive interactions between caregivers and people with dementia. As outcomes, we identify that special consideration should be directed toward the choice of personally relevant and engaging content, contextual factors of the therapy situations, and high usability of potential therapy artefacts. Suggestions for future research and further prototype iterations are provided. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Background Health care organizations increasingly use patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to capture patients' health status. Although federal policy mandates PRO collection, the challenge remains to better engage patients in PRO surveys, and ensure patients comprehend the surveys and their results. Objective This article identifies the design requirements for an interface that assists patients with PRO survey completion and interpretation, and then builds and evaluates the interface. Methods We employed a user-centered design process that consisted of three stages. First, we conducted qualitative interviews and surveys with 13 patients and 11 health care providers to understand their perceptions of the value and challenges associated with the use of PRO measures. Second, we used the results to identify design requirements for an interface that collects PROs, and designed the interface. Third, we conducted usability testing with 12 additional patients in a hospital setting. Results In interviews, patients and providers reported that PRO surveys help patients to reflect on their symptoms, potentially identifying new opportunities for improved care. However, 6 out of 13 patients reported significant difficultly in understanding PRO survey questions, answer choices and results. Therefore, we identified aiding comprehension as a key design requirement, and incorporated visualizations into our interface design to aid comprehension. In usability testing, patients found the interface highly usable. Conclusion Future interfaces designed to collect PROs may benefit from employing strategies such as visualization to aid comprehension and engage patients with surveys. © 2018 Georg Thieme Verlag.

AB  - This study aims to create a user interface design for the designing web marketplace of qurban cattle sales in East Java, Indonesia. The word qurban referred as the qurban animal slaughtered during the Eid al-Adha, especially cow. The qurban web market can help breeders and customers in the process of selling cattle directly without limited territory. This is because the process of selling qurban cows is still done traditionally by ordering directly by phone and coming directly to the cattle pen for the selection of qurban animals desired by consumers. To deal with these problems, an alternative solution is needed that can create a Web Marketplace interface design that is designed using the User-Centered Design (UCD) method, focusing on the user's primary needs. This method was chosen because it focuses on the user's goals, characteristics, and workflow in the design process. How the system can be understood and used by users is a top priority in this web design and involves users in designing the marketplace web interface. Therefore it is very suitable for designing a website that is simple and easy to use. The design of the web marketplace of qurban cattle sales has four main features which are promotion of qurban cattle, online qurban cattle bookigs (direct purchases or livestock care services), payment confirmation, and qurban cattle contributions for collective purchases or in groups. The results of the System Usability Scale (SUS) test distributed to 30 respondents obtained a value of 79.3 which indicates that the qurban web marketplace design can be accepted by users and can be classified as good design. © 2020 Register: Jurnal Ilmiah Teknologi Sistem Informasi (Scientific Journal of Information System Technology) with CC BY NC SA license.

AB  - Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) has been transformed by the social media revolution made possible by the emergence of mobile technology. The cumbersome dedicated devices of the 1970s have evolved into a burgeoning AAC app industry. However, the limited use and abandonment of AAC technologies remains high. Unlocking the untapped potential of technology requires a paradigm shift in the design of AAC technologies by building systems that minimize the cognitive load placed on users, adapting to their individual physical and language needs. Telling Tales shares insights and stories of how the combination of user-centred design, interdisciplinary research and the application of intelligent computing is providing a vision of future generations of AAC technologies. © 2018 The Authors International Journal of Language & Communication Disorders published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to identify potential needs and barriers related to using exoskeletons to decrease musculoskeletal (MS) symptoms for workers in the operating room (OR). Background: MS symptoms and injuries adversely impact worker health and performance in surgical environments. Half of the surgical team members (e.g., surgeons, nurses, trainees) report MS symptoms during and after surgery. Although the ergonomic risks in surgery are well recognized, little has been done to develop and sustain effective interventions. Method: Surgical team members (n = 14) participated in focus groups, performed a 10-min simulated surgical task with a commercial upper-body exoskeleton, and then completed a usability questionnaire. Content analysis was conducted to determine relevant themes. Results: Four themes were identified: (1) characteristics of individuals, (2) perceived benefits, (3) environmental/societal factors, and (4) intervention characteristics. Participants noted that exoskeletons would benefit workers who stand in prolonged, static postures (e.g., holding instruments for visualization) and indicated that they could foresee a long-term decrease in MS symptoms with the intervention. Specifically, raising awareness of exoskeletons for early-career workers and obtaining buy-in from team members may increase future adoption of this technology. Mean participant responses from the System Usability Scale was 81.3 out of 100 (SD = 8.1), which was in the acceptable range of usability. Conclusion: Adoption factors were identified to implement exoskeletons in the OR, such as the indicated need for exoskeletons and usability. Exoskeletons may be beneficial in the OR, but barriers such as maintenance and safety to adoption will need to be addressed. Application: Findings from this work identify facilitators and barriers for sustained implementation of exoskeletons by surgical teams. © 2019, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

AB  - This paper describes a pilot project education in Design for All and usability evaluations for people with different disabilities. The concept “(in)spectors” began as a vision to create a platform where people due to their disability, can be a resource for companies, organizations and governmental agencies in the development of an accessible society with easy to use and attractive products, services and environments. By educating (in)spectors in how to design, organize and participate in usability testing and accessibility analyses they could be an exclusive resource in development and planning, thanks to the combination of knowledge and their disabilities. The vision of the (in)spectors would thereby lead both to that people with disabilities are utilized as an important resource and that they through this creates conditions for inclusion of more people with disabilities into society and employment. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - In this project, an online escape game for older adults was developed collaboratively with five novice developers and 12 older adults who tested the prototype game at several stages of the development process. We followed a User-Centered Design (UCD) process to develop the game. During the design process, older adults tested the game and it was refined based on their feedback and the research team’s observation of their play. We found that incorporating older adults into the design process significantly improved the design, as they provided insights that would not have been available otherwise. We also concluded that the older adults’ involvement in the design process could make the game better tailored to their needs. The game is currently being field-tested. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - Background As they grow older, many elderly people are faced with the difficult and preference-sensitive decision about staying in their home or moving to a residence better adapted to their evolving care needs. We aimed to develop an English and French decision aid (DA) for elderly people facing this decision, and to involve end-users in all phases of the development process. Methods A three-cycle design with involvement of end-users in Quebec. End-users were elderly people (n = 4) caregivers of the elderly (n = 5), health administrators involved in home-care service delivery or policy (n = 6) and an interprofessional research team (n = 19). Cycle 1: Decisional needs assessment and development of the first prototype based on existing tools and input from end-users; overview of reviews examining the impact of location of care on elderly people’s health outcomes. Cycle 2: Usability testing with end-users, adaptation of prototype. Cycle 3: Refinement of the prototype with a linguist, graphic designer and end-users. The final prototype underwent readability testing and an International Patient Decision Aids (IPDAS) criteria compatibility assessment to verify minimal requirements for decision aids and was tested for usability by the elderly. Results Cycle 1: We used the Ottawa Personal Decision Guide to design a first prototype. As the overview of reviews did not find definitive evidence regarding optimal locations of care for elderly people, we were not able to add evidence-based advantages and disadvantages to the guide. Cycle 2: Overall, the caregivers and health administrators who evaluated the prototype (n = 10) were positive. In response to their suggestions, we deleted some elements (overview of pros, cons, and consequences of the options) that were necessary to qualify the tool as a DA and renamed it a “decision guide”. Cycle 3: We developed French and English versions of the guide, readable at a primary school level. The elderly judged the guide as acceptable. Conclusion We developed a decision guide to support elderly people and their caregivers in decision making about location of care. This paper is one of few to report on a fully collaborative approach to decision guide development that involves end-users at every stage (caregivers and health administrators early on, the frail elderly in the final stages). The guide is currently being evaluated in a cluster randomized trial. Trial registration: NCT02244359. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common and preventable cause of stroke. Barriers to reducing stroke risk through appropriate prescribing have been identified at the system, provider, and patient levels. To ensure a multifaceted initiative to address these barriers is effective, it is essential to incorporate user-centered design to ensure all intervention components are optimized for users. Objective: To test the usability of an electronic medical record (EMR) toolkit for AF in primary care with the goal of further refining the intervention to meet the needs of primary care clinicians. Methods: An EMR-based toolkit for AF was created and optimized through usability testing and iterative redesign incorporating a human factors approach. A mixed-methods pilot study consisting of observations, semi-structured interviews, and surveys was conducted to examine usability and perceived impact on patient care and workflow. Results: A total of 14 clinicians (13 family physicians and 1 nurse practitioner) participated in the study. Nine iterations of the toolkit were created in response to feedback from clinicians and the research team; interface-related changes were made, additional AF-related resources were added, and functionality issues were fixed to make the toolkit more effective. After improvements were made, clinicians expressed that the toolkit improved accessibility to AF-related information and resources, served as a reminder for guideline-concordant AF management, and was easy to use. Most clinicians intended to continue using the toolkit for patient care. With respect to impact on care, clinicians believed the toolkit increased the thoroughness of their assessments for patients with AF and improved the quality of AF-related care received by their patients. Conclusions: The positive feedback surrounding the EMR toolkit for AF and its perceived impact on patient care can be attributed to the adoption of a user-centered design that merged clinically important information about AF management with user needs. This study demonstrates the utility of a human factors approach to piloting and refining an intervention prior to wide-scale implementation. © 2016 JMIR Human Factors. All rights reserved.

AB  - We present a study testing whether adding a scapegoat design (one that is clearly stylistically worse than the other designs and thus easier to critique) will make users feel more comfortable with giving more feedback on the other designs that the experimenters want feedback on. We found that participants who are shown a scapegoat design in parallel with other designs did not only provide more critiques, but also more substantial critiques - resulting in both higher quality and quantity of user feedback. Our results imply that the psychology of scapegoating can be successfully adapted to help the HCI community improve the effectiveness of user testing.

AB  - People with hearing loss have limitation in communication. According to this study in SLB-B Cicendo Bandung, Indonesia, most of the deaf students are enthusiastic to learn English. Meanwhile, they consider learning English is very hard because of the differences in pronunciation and spelling. In Indonesia, the education media to learn English is not developed much. The aim is to deliver proper interaction and user interface design for education media to help deaf youths learning English. This study uses user-centered design approach because deaf youths are unique. The proposed design for this study is a conceptual model using gamification, repetition, and leveling concept. This conceptual model uses picture, lip-reading video, text, and sign language to help users understand the contents. For usability testing, the design was implemented into high-fidelity prototype of hybrid mobile application. The result showed that the design of the prototype was already suited to most of the proposed usability goals and user experiences. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - As designers work to plan nuclear control room human-system interfaces to meet an all-digital, highly dynamic, and complex vision without unduly changing the nuclear licensed operator paradigm, the intricacy of the system calls for an efficient and practical design process. One aspect of an efficient design process is anticipation of the fast-paced change in enabling software technology while considering modular design facets and maintaining a single user interface methodology. This paper will be a discussion of a generic, user-centered human-system interface design management strategy. This strategy has aspects of the Agile software development lifecycle methodology, which is typically used outside the nuclear industry. The Agile strategy has recently been tapped to provide a more efficient and integrated concept-to-release design strategy for the Department of Defense project acquisition process. Characteristics to be discussed include enabling of a rapid design process via such steps as storyboarding, user stories, wireframing, high-fidelity display page creation, global layout and navigation, high-fidelity simulator development, usability testing to verify user story completion criteria, and design modification.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this systematic review is to synthesize research studies involving the use of smart watch devices for healthcare. Materials and Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was chosen as the systematic review methodology. We searched PubMed, CINAHL Plus, EMBASE, ACM, and IEEE Xplore. In order to include ongoing clinical trials, we also searched ClinicalTrials.gov. Two investigators evaluated the retrieved articles for inclusion. Discrepancies between investigators regarding article inclusion and extracted data were resolved through team discussion. Results: 356 articles were screened and 24 were selected for review. The most common publication venue was in conference proceedings (13, 54%). The majority of studies were published or presented in 2015 (19, 79%). We identified two registered clinical trials underway. A large proportion of the identified studies focused on applications involving health monitoring for the elderly (6, 25%). Five studies focused on patients with Parkinson’s disease and one on cardiac arrest. There were no studies which reported use of usability testing before implementation. Discussion: Most of the reviewed studies focused on the chronically ill elderly. There was a lack of detailed description of user-centered design or usability testing before implementation. Based on our review, the most commonly used platform in healthcare research was that of the Android Wear. The clinical application of smart watches as assistive devices deserves further attention. Conclusion: Smart watches are unobtrusive and easy to wear. While smart watch technology supplied with biosensors has potential to be useful in a variety of healthcare applications, rigorous research with their use in clinical settings is needed. © Schattauer 2016.

AB  - Evaluating a prototype is necessary to user-centered software design, but evaluating groupware systems prior to full deployment can be challenging and costly. Existing groupware evaluation methods focus on individual users, expert inspections, or require the system to be rolled out. We describe a method - based on Gutwin and Greenberg's mechanics of collaboration (MoC) framework - for evaluating prototype groupware systems that have not yet been deployed with the minimum number of users needed to be truly functional. We believe this is a valuable method for evaluating early prototype groupware.

AB  - Many dashboards display analytics generated by educational technologies, but few of them work with intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). We are creating a teacher dashboard for use with ITSs built and used within our CTAT/Tutorshop infrastructure: an environment for authoring and deploying ITSs. The dashboard will take advantage of the fine-grained interaction data and derived analytics that CTAT-built ITSs produce. We are taking a user-centered design approach in which we target two usage scenarios for the dashboard. In one scenario, a teacher uses the dashboard while helping a class of students working with the tutoring software in the school's computer lab. In the other, the teacher uses the dashboard to prepare for an upcoming class session. So far, we have completed a Contextual Inquiry, ideation, Speed Dating sessions in which teachers evaluated story boards, usability testing, and a classroom study with a mocked up version of the dashboard with real data from the teacher's current classes and students. We are currently analyzing the data produced in these activities, iterating on the design of the dashboard, and implementing a full version of the dashboard. Unique characteristics of this dashboard may be that it leverages finegrained interaction data produced by an ITS and that it will be fully integrated with an ITS development and deployment environment, and therefore available for use with many ITSs.

AB  - The LudoVico UX Machine-A FREELY AVAILABLE SOFTWARE FOR USABILITY TESTING. Gathering and the interpretation of usability data is a rather challenging task. We implemented a new tool for recording, archiving, and interpreting sensor data from user-experience (UX) experiments. The tool is capable of handling any type of sensor data. The current version of the tool named "The LudoVico UX Machine" is contributed as freely available tool to the UX community. It shall assist user experience designers in managing their experimental data. The current version is capable of handling medical and biofeedback data, which can be archived, analyzed, and visualized. Future implementations will include generic sensor data via a plug-in concept, and provide data-analysis capability to get deeper insights into gathered data. The tool shall contribute with a new technology to support the interaction design process across applications: smart cities, smart living, smart interaction, urban informatics, health, sustainable living, audience response, or biofeedback. The tool will be made available in mid-2016 and can be found on: http://www.artur-lugmayr.com.

AB  - Authoring and editing access control policy can be a complex and cognitive demanding task, especially when dealing with a large number of rules and attributes. Visualisation techniques are known to be helpful to users analysing intricate data, and can, in some contexts, help decreasing the cognitive load. In this paper, we propose a new tool, VisABAC, which enables the visualisation of attribute based access control policies using the Circle Packing method. We used a participatory design, following a survey of existing visualisation methods in access control. VisABAC is designed as a web-page component, developed in Javascript using the D3.js library, and as such is easily usable without requiring any particular setup. In addition to presenting VisABAC, we demonstrate its usability by conducting a controlled experiment with 32 participants, asking them to change some attribute values in order to obtain a given decision for a policy, and measuring the time taken by participants to conduct these tasks (the faster, the better). We show a small to medium effect size (d = 0.44), thus indicating that VisABAC is a promising tool for authoring and editing access control policies.

AB  - Background: Despite widespread electronic health record (EHR) adoption, poor EHR system usability continues to be a significant barrier to effective system use for end users. One key to addressing usability problems is to employ user testing and user-centered design. Objectives: To understand if redesigning an EHR-based navigation tool with clinician input improved user performance and satisfaction. Methods: A usability evaluation was conducted to compare two versions of a redesigned ambulatory navigator. Participants completed tasks for five patient cases using the navigators, while employing a think-aloud protocol. The tasks were based on Meaningful Use (MU) requirements. Results: The version of navigator did not affect perceived workload, and time to complete tasks was longer in the redesigned navigator. A relatively small portion of navigator content was used to complete the MU-related tasks, though navigation patterns were highly variable across participants for both navigators. Preferences for EHR navigation structures appeared to be individualized. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the importance of EHR usability assessments to evaluate group and individual performance of different interfaces and preferences for each design. © Schattauer 2016.

AB  - Maintaining and managing independent living depends on older adult’s ability to remain safe and healthy. We researched the needs of older adults in co nnected living spaces to address the issue of forgetfulness to aid aging in place. We conducted formative and evaluative user studies, starting with contextual interviews in home, followed by usability testing of prototypes, and participatory design sessions. Here we discuss the findings, and the design guidelines abstracted from the user studies with older adults. We also reflect on adapting traditional forms of the research methods to better understand the needs of this demographic. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

AB  - People interacts their environment by communicating, but some limitation may exist such as hearing disability that occurs to deaf people. Usually, they communicate by using sign language. Unfortunately, there is various sign language in the world. This research is evaluating the usability of smartphone for communication board that can be used by deaf people to communicate to others, especially the people who don't understand the sign language. Usability testing is to measure the user performance for mobile applications. The five criteria for the usability, according to Nielsen are learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors, and satisfaction. The study obtained the result of 88.36% of usability testing. © 2018, International Association of Online Engineering.

AB  - This paper examines stakeholder communication and interaction dynamics in place branding processes in order to inform alternative participatory place branding models. The paper draws from critical communications and branding theory to argue that place brand identities are the result of mediated messages in the public sphere. Consequently, place branding processes need to be observed as communicative exchanges. Through a case study of Australia’s southern and only island state of Tasmania, the research employs participatory action research combined with the method of sociological intervention to explore stakeholders’ communicative interaction patterns and engagement in place branding processes. Participants representing formal and informal stakeholders engaged in communicating meaning about places were invited to participate in a series of interviews and focus group discussions that allowed a unique self-reflective process and analysis of practices and power-geometries. The proposed quasi-real scenario led to an understanding of the impediments for communication and to scoping alternative modes of engagement towards effective stakeholder communication to support the development of resilient place brand identities. The findings of the exploration contribute to theoretical development of the field by providing an analysis of the nature of stakeholder interactions and communication patterns, impediments and opportunities for greater communication and collaboration towards a common purpose. On a practical level, the study can also inform the development of participatory models of place brand development. Finally, the method proposed here can serve as a practical tool to foster stakeholder engagement in processes of co-creation of place brand identities. © 2018 Communication & Society.

AB  - The increasing number of commuter line train users was followed by the innovation of ticket vending machine that replaced the manual counter. Problems arise when 79% of users find it difficult to use the ticket machine. The purpose of this research is to produce a prototype of ticket machine that gives ease of use and display. User-centered design approach is used to generate a wireframe, mock-up, and prototype. The respondents involved are 20 people that divided into 2 groups according to their technological proficiency scale. Physical wireframe then arranged into a mock-up in accordance to Indonesian anthropometric measurement. The mock-up then arranged into a 1:1 three-dimensional prototype. The results show a safe and convenient workload on posture evaluation and a high-performance score on the usability testing. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - The transition from individual and dependent learning style into collaborative and self-regulated learning is a challenge for new students in higher education. Self-monitoring process is one of the methods that can be used to answer the challenge. In addition, lecturers also need to monitor students' understanding about certain topics. A web-based selfmonitoring tool was developed using prototyping paradigm and user-centered design process. The features of the tool include create prompts, view the students' answers by the prompt or student's name, and give feedback to the students based on keywords appeared on their answers. Usability testing was conducted to measure how usable is the system. We then revised the system from the users' recommendations.

AB  - The rapid technological developments in the manufacturing industry and an increasing demand for more and more complex and individual products has led to the development of modern machine tools from simple tools to highly automated technical products. The trend towards cyber physical production systems will intensify this development in the machine tool sector in context with the so-called fourth industrial revolution. In particular, the increasing quantity of mechatronic components in machine tools has led to a high amount of different functions that need to be controlled by the user. Empirical research has shown that user oriented Human-Machine-Interface-design (HMI-design) reduces error rates and cognitive load for the machine operator and can lead to an increase in effectiveness and efficiency with regard to the interaction. In this paper we introduce a study which points out the impact of user centered design by analyzing the differences of workflow-oriented and function-oriented HMIs. The results of the study show that work task performance can be enhanced by workflow-oriented HMI by improving the time needed and diminishing the number of clicks and errors for specific work tasks. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Multiple thinking of different stakeholders has to influence collabo-rative working. Some part of information exchange is fragment knowledge that is a significant challenge to complete knowledge co-creation from various do-mains. However, an effective obstacle is miscommunication among the stake-holders, particularly when ambiguous terms are mentioned in the discussion contexts. To overcome the challenge, this paper proposes an integration ap-proach of network text analysis and knowledge graph embedding. The approach is employed for understanding semantic meaning of terms from a source of knowledge, as a discussion forum. We calculate each term detected by our cross-domain codebook onto the vector space and straightforwardly investigate the relationship among questions and answers on it. To demonstrate the benefits of employing the approach, the system's functionality is implemented to mani-fest a capability of detecting and reducing miscommunication by the case study of Life Cycle Assessment's discussion board.

AB  - Effectiveness in modern healthcare and services and the optimization of processes and operational sequences must be designed from the perspective of the end user. This paper aims to identify and analyse the common practices of User Centred Design (UCD) that had been implemented in previous studies in the context of analysis, design and evaluation phases and provide an overview from the research findings as a reference for other researchers. Studies were manually searched via online databases and further analysed based on the predefined research questions. This study reviews 60 papers published in the field of healthcare services on adopted UCD approaches between 1992 and 2014 (May). The results show that although UCD approach has a history of 22 years, it is not yet a normalcy in Asia countries. Interview, prototyping and usability testing are the most common activities adopted in respect to the UCD phases. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Agile practices are release planning, sprint planning, and standup meetings. The Agile provides the requisite time and space for teams, enabling them, to collaborate with each other and build relationship among them. Frequent short meetings are being held daily by Agile teams to identify potential collaboration opportunities to be followed. User Centered Design (UCD) is a user interface design process which lays great emphasis on the usability objectives, user features, environmental circumstances, tasks and work input/flow in the design/model of an interface. However, some challenges occurred when the UCD joins the Agile process such as usability issues, collaboration problems, usability testing etc. The proposed model not only embraces the relevant issues but it resolves the same to a great extent. The evaluation of said model is done through a case study. © 2018. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Children with motor coordination problems exhibit impairments in gross-motor eye-body coordination. Exergames are good in supporting motor therapeutic interventions. However, available exergames are not designed to support the needs of these children, presenting excessive cognitive load and suggesting practice of inappropriate body interactions. In this work, we investigate the design of exergames to support children with motor problems during gross-motor therapeutic interventions. We followed an iterative user-centered design methodology to design FroggyBobby – an exergame to support children with motor problems when practicing eye-body coordination exercises. Our design involved two qualitative studies: a study to understand the problem space, and a study to validate an initial design of FroggyBobby. Additionally, we held participatory design sessions to uncover the gameful mechanisms and appropriate motor coordination exercises to support motor therapeutic interventions. To evaluate FroggyBobby, we conducted a deployment study with children with low-functioning autism presenting motor problems and psychologist-teachers at a school-clinic for autism. FroggyBobby was found easy to use, fun, and engaging by children with autism and teachers. Psychologist-teachers perceived FroggyBobby impacted motor functioning, socialization and body awareness, and successfully supported motor therapeutic interventions. We close reflecting how our results present new insights from a design, technical, and therapeutic point of view. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the scope of the study, the development stages are implemented by adopting a user-centered design approach to a software for managing in-house approval processes in the sales process of an enterprise. In the software development process, evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of the software being developed by the usability evaluation approaches is provided by twostage usability tests. In the course of the findings, software design deficiencies are identified and improvements are planned. The study demonstrates that how easy it is to evaluate how well design expectations are met by usability testing by incorporating users at every stage of software design in the software design process.

AB  - This paper presents experience in running HCI short course as part of an Ergonomics Masters programme. It comprises of a series of lectures, and practical exercises to develop the skills and knowledge required for undertaking interaction design work and usability and UX evaluation. These cover the psychology underlying human-computer interaction and user experience, user-centred design process (UCD), user research, prototyping, user testing, control of systems, information architecture, persona and scenario based design techniques, user interface design, usability testing, and HCI in certain application areas. The course tries to adopt best practice based on constructivist learning and Bloom’s taxonomy where students can relate the teaching to their own experiences and are guided through a UCD process starting with research and creating an application. A SWOT analysis highlights some key areas where the course can improve if it is to keep up with learning techniques and technologies and to become efficient in a world where University courses are becoming more expensive. Opportunities for the future of the course are to learn more technical tools for prototyping, breaking out of the classroom to interact with people in the real world, and better integration of all presentations to create providing a stronger unifying HCI theme. Guidelines are offered for organisers of similar courses in the future. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - There has been an increase in the amount and complexity of traffic on Dutch inland waterways. Traffic management shifted from local traffic control to corridor traffic management. Due to these changes, operators in nautical traffic management centers experience difficulty to gain and maintain sufficient situation awareness. In our previous research, three groups of deficiencies of current situation awareness support have been identified. To overcome these deficiencies, a theoretical framework for information engineering user interface concepts was developed and used for designing three interface concepts. A coherent, an integrated and a context-dependent adaptable user interface were designed and implemented as testable prototypes. To support the process of information engineering, we combined user-centered design techniques with the formalism of set theory, directed graphs and semantic networks. From a methodological point of view, these proved to be useful both in conceptualization and implementation of the concepts. The usability of these concepts was tested in a simulator environment. The results show that the implemented prototypes represent an important improvement compared to the traditional interface solutions currently used by nautical traffic management operators. However, it was recognized that the coherent user interface implementation still suffered from a number of deficiencies. The context-dependent adaptable user interface was evaluated most positively. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Usability evaluation is accounted as a critical phase of user-centered software design and development. It is the stage where project teams can observe and measure the usability of their solutions and user interfaces, in terms of visual design, interaction, functionality, terminology, content, scenario applicability, etc. During this process, teams collect qualitative and quantitative data, or feedback items, that they have to analyze and interpret in a collaborative manner, aligning with end-users’ needs and requirements and tackling specific problems or cumbersome actions. In this respect, this paper proposes EUREKA, an end-to-end Workflow-as-a-Service methodology and open tool for usability testing data analysis. It facilitates a guided expansive learning experience for the teams when applying reasoning to the collected feedback while at the same time maintains a balanced qualitative and quantitative perspective of the research results. EUREKA has been positively evaluated highlighting its added value through the maximization of outcome compared to the effort invested for empirical data analysis, in terms of a goal-directed, consistent and flexible methodology, and a modular tool that provides structured and semantically enriched content, and a smart data visualization overview. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - The use of mobile devices in healthcare is increasing in prevalence and poses different constraints for use than traditional desktop computing. This chapter introduces several usability testing methods that are appropriate for use when designing and developing mobile technologies. Approaching the development of mobile technologies through a user-centered approach is critical to improve the interaction and use of the hardware and software that is implemented on a mobile platform in healthcare. User-centered design adds value by getting feedback about functionality, design, and constraints that need to be built into the system prior to its completion. Future work in this domain will require further tailoring and use of novel usability methods to evaluate and improve the design of mobile healthcare technologies. © 2016 by IGI Global.

AB  - Background: Design processes such as human-centered design, which involve the end user throughout the product development and testing process, can be crucial in ensuring that the product meets the needs and capabilities of the user, particularly in terms of safety and user experience. The structured and iterative nature of human-centered design can often present a challenge when design teams are faced with the necessary, rapid, product development life cycles associated with the competitive connected health industry. Objective: We wanted to derive a structured methodology that followed the principles of human-centered design that would allow designers and developers to ensure that the needs of the user are taken into account throughout the design process, while maintaining a rapid pace of development. In this paper, we present the methodology and its rationale before outlining how it was applied to assess and enhance the usability, human factors, and user experience of a connected health system known as the Wireless Insole for Independent and Safe Elderly Living (WIISEL) system, a system designed to continuously assess fall risk by measuring gait and balance parameters associated with fall risk. Methods: We derived a three-phase methodology. In Phase 1 we emphasized the construction of a use case document. This document can be used to detail the context of use of the system by utilizing storyboarding, paper prototypes, and mock-ups in conjunction with user interviews to gather insightful user feedback on different proposed concepts. In Phase 2 we emphasized the use of expert usability inspections such as heuristic evaluations and cognitive walkthroughs with small multidisciplinary groups to review the prototypes born out of the Phase 1 feedback. Finally, in Phase 3 we emphasized classical user testing with target end users, using various metrics to measure the user experience and improve the final prototypes. Results: We report a successful implementation of the methodology for the design and development of a system for detecting and predicting falls in older adults. We describe in detail what testing and evaluation activities we carried out to effectively test the system and overcome usability and human factors problems. Conclusions: We feel this methodology can be applied to a wide variety of connected health devices and systems. We consider this a methodology that can be scaled to different-sized projects accordingly. © 2017 JMIR Human Factors. All rights reserved.

AB  - Among the unique challenges faced by nursing homes is poor communication and notification. An analysis of the work system showed that a mobile device-based system that rely less on auditory display is promising. We proposed a smartwatch interface as part of communication and notification system for nursing homes. A user-centered design approach was adopted in the design and evaluation of the interface. The application integrates call light system, chair and bed alarms, wander guard, and calling for help functions and uses multi-modal interfaces to provide informative alarms for nursing home staff. Through a process of iterative testing and refinement with prospective users (through cognitive walkthrough, heuristic evaluation and usability testing of low-fidelity prototypes), a final design was well received by nursing experts in geriatric care and at local nursing homes. The effects of the system will be tested in the future using a high-fidelity prototype through simulation experiment. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - In this study we empirically investigate the integration of User-Centered Design (UCD) practices into agile Web development. We propose a hybrid process framework which extends the agile development process, adding lightweight usability engineering practices. We conducted a case study in academia with postgraduate students to empirically evaluate the impact of the hybrid process to the quality of the web products, based on a defect quality analysis through the development phases from user stories gathering up to delivery of the products. The statistical analysis of the quantitative data showed a great improvement in the distribution of the closing-defects across the development phases and full reduction of the defects number, leading to increased quality. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is 1 of the leading causes of death, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted years of life lost worldwide. CVD prevention for children and teens is needed, as CVD risk factors and behaviors beginning in youth contribute to CVD development. In 2012, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute released their "Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents" for clinicians, describing CVD risk factors they should address with patients at primary care preventative visits. However, uptake of new guidelines is slow. Clinical decision support (CDS) tools can improve guideline uptake. In this paper, we describe our process of testing and adapting a CDS tool to help clinicians evaluate patient risk, recommend behaviors to prevent development of risk, and complete complex calculations to determine appropriate interventions as recommended by the guidelines, using a user-centered design approach. Objective: The objective of the study was to assess the usability of a pediatric CVD risk factor tool by clinicians. Methods: The tool was tested using one-on-one in-person testing and a "think aloud" approach with 5 clinicians and by using the tool in clinical practice along with formal usability metrics with 14 pediatricians. Thematic analysis of the data from the in-person testing and clinical practice testing identified suggestions for change in 3 major areas: user experience, content refinement, and technical deployment. Descriptive statistical techniques were employed to summarize users' overall experience with the tool. Results: Data from testers showed that general reactions toward the CDS tool were positive. Clinical practice testers suggested revisions to make the application more user-friendly, especially for clinicians using the application on the iPhone, and called for refining recommendations to be more succinct and better tailored to the patient. Tester feedback was incorporated into the design when feasible, including streamlining data entry during clinical visits, reducing the volume of results displayed, and highlighting critical results. Conclusions: This study found support for the usability of our pediatric CVD risk factor tool. Insights shared about this tool may be applicable for designing other mHealth applications and CDS tools. The usability of decision support tools in clinical practice depends critically on receiving (ie, through an accessible device) and adapting the tool to meet the needs of clinicians in the practice setting. © 2016 JMIR Human Factors.

AB  - We present the first iteration of a user-centred design for integrating an eye gaze tracker with ultrasound (US) machine interfaces used in routine diagnostic sonography. The aim is to speed up the interaction of the sonographer with the machine, offer a more ergonomic solution while minimizing the cognitive load and maintaining the produced image quality. In this iteration, we target pan and zoom functions. Field studies and observations have led to two design alternatives. A feasibility study of two design approaches determined from field studies is done using a functional prototype. Results from six sonographers provided evidence for the potential of a multimodal gaze-based interface for US machines. Results from the feasibility study have also led to a second design iteration that combines the advantages of both gaze-based designs.

AB  - Mapping conventions are a key aspect of user centered design as they present users with familiar interactions in unfamiliar products. Conventions evolve over time and are slow to be adopted, requiring a high percentage of acceptance within a society, ensuring that conventions exhibit a sufficient level of usability. However this paper argues that while usability is a necessary condition for good interactions it is not a sufficient one. Therefore user centered design which accents individuals bias towards conventions my in fact be hindering the innovation of product interactions. This paper argues that a cognitive approach should be adopted in order understand and reassess product interactions. An experiment was carried out that demonstrates the influence that simple mappings can have on cognitive load. The results showed that basic mappings of the types that are found throughout product conventions can have a substantial impact on mental load and subsequently product interaction. © 2015, Association for the Development of Science, Engineering and Education.

AB  - Massively Multiplayer Online Role-playing Games (MMORPGs) feature a large number of players socially interacting with one another in an immersive gaming environment. A successful MMORPG should engage players and meet their needs to achieve different categories of gratifications. Research on the evolution of player social interaction network and the dynamics of inter-player intimacy could provide insights into players' gratification-oriented behaviors in MMORPGs. Such understanding could in turn guide game designs for better engaging existing players and marketing strategies for attracting newcomers. Conventional dynamic network analysis may help investigate game-based social interactions at the macroscopic level. However, current dynamic network visualization techniques mainly focus on illustrating topological changes of the entire network, which are unsuitable for analyzing player-specific social interactions in the virtual world from an egocentric perspective. In general, game designers and operators find it difficult to analyze the way players with different gratification needs may interact with one another and the consequences on their relationships with direct ties, using a decentralized social graph with complicated time-varying structures. In this paper, we present MMOSeer, a visual analytics system for exploring the evolution of egocentric player intimacy network. MMOSeer focuses on the relationship between a player (ego) and his/her directly-linked friends (alters). We follow a user-centered design process to develop the system with game analysts and apply novel visualization techniques in conjunction with well-established algorithms to depict the evolution of intimacy egocentric network. We also derive a centrality change metric to infer how the impact of changes in an ego's interactive behaviors may propagate through the intimacy network, reshaping the structure of the alters' social circles at both micro and macro levels. Finally, we validate the usability of MMOSeer by discovering different user interaction patterns and the corresponding ego-network structural changes in a real-world gameplay dataset from a commercial MMORPG. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - One of the many difficulties faced in cities include the accumulation of waste in streets, sidewalks, public squares, causing major environmental problems. This is not only due to lack of public policies and urban infrastructure, but also lack of citizen participation. Given this scenario, there is a crucial need to educate the people, especially children, who represent the future of society. This study presents a mobile serious game proposal, called "Protecting the Earth", about selective waste collection, recycling, reduction of waste production and waste reuse in different game stages with focuses in childish public. The methodology adopted included Systematic Review; application of Participatory Design methods, such as the Context Inquiry technique; specification of functional and non-functional requirements and the study of technologies appropriate for developing the project. Experiments were conducted with children aiming to assess the proposed tool's interface. The results obtained by means of usability testing with users showed the need for adjustments in the interface in order to achieve greater accessibility and user satisfaction, and were met immediately. The next step is to perform learning evaluation experiments in order to verify if the proposed serious game is collaborating to acquire user knowledge about the study object (Environmental Education). © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Many elderly people are living apart from their children. We want to develop a system that can reinforce the connection and emotional feelings between aged parents and their children by combing new digital technologies with soft and warm leather material. Through an iterative design process that includes user interview and observation, design exploration, low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes, and usability testing, we present a small digital screen attached to an existing leather wallet of the aged parent to receive and display pictures or videos sent from their adult children. By attaching LINK, the old leather wallet serves as an invisible channel, sharing and connecting beautiful family memories without interrupting the private life of either side. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - At present, the augmented reality technology based on mobile platform has already been used in a wide range of applications in the field of human-computer interaction. However, there is a problem that the neglect of important role of cognitive psychology and the luck of presentation of interactive information cause a poor user experience of the application. In this paper, a mobile virtual reality and augmented reality browsing system is proposed. A human-computer interaction experiment was performed by the combined use of the Macro Mental Model and Micro Mental Model. The user interface of this system was designed and realized through repeated evaluation and usability testing based on the implantation of user-centered design principles. Finally, interactive experience of this system approaches the user's psychological expectations. Furthermore, through the switch freely between virtual reality and augmented reality environments, users can obtain two distinct interactive experiences. The experimental results show that the user interface design of this system can not only mobilize the enthusiasm of user interaction, but also improve the sense of the man-machine interactive experience on the aspect of usability and efficiency. ©, 2015, Science Press.

AB  - Human factors and ergonomics (HFE) and related approaches can be used to enhance research and development of consumer-facing health information technology (IT) systems, including technologies supporting the needs of people with chronic disease. A multiphase HFE study of health IT supporting self-care of chronic heart failure by older adults is described. The study was based on HFE frameworks of “patient work” and incorporated the three broad phases of user-centered design: study or analysis, design, and evaluation. In the study phase, data from observations, interviews, surveys, and other methods were analyzed to identify gaps in and requirements for supporting heart failure self-care. The design phase applied findings from the study phase throughout an iterative process, culminating in the design of the Engage application, a product intended for continuous use over 30 days to stimulate self-care engagement, behavior, and knowledge. During the evaluation phase, a variety of usability issues through expert heuristic evaluation and laboratory-based usability testing were identified. The implications of our findings regarding heart failure self-care in older adults and the methodological challenges of rapid translational field research and development in this domain are discussed. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Introduction Cognitive aids, such as a guideline for the management of severe local anaesthetic (LA) toxicity, are tools designed to help users complete a task. Human factors experts recommend the use of simulation to iteratively test and re-design these tools. The purpose of this study was to apply human factors engineering principles to the testing and iterative re-design of three existing cognitive aids used for the management of severe LA toxicity and to use these data to develop a 'new' cognitive aid. Methods Twenty anaesthetist-anaesthetic assistant pairs were randomised into four groups. Each of the first three groups received one of three different existing cognitive aids during a standardised simulated LA toxicity crisis. Postsimulation semistructured interviews were conducted to identify features beneficial and detrimental to the format and usability of the aid. Synthesis of the interview data with established checklist design recommendations resulted in a prototype aid, which was subjected to further testing and re-design by the fourth group (five more pairs) under the same conditions thus creating the final iteration of the new aid. Results Features of the new aid included a single-stream flowchart structure, single-sided, large-font design with colour contrast, simplified instructions and no need for calculations. This simplified tool contains only the information users reported as essential for the immediate crisis management. Conclusions Utilisation of formative usability testing and simulation-based user-centred design resulted in a visually very different cognitive aid and reinforces the importance of designing aids in the context in which they are to be used. Simplified tools may be more appropriate for use in emergencies but more detailed guidelines may be necessary for training, education and development of local standard operating procedures. Iterative simulation-based testing and re-design is likely to be of assistance when developing aids for other crises, and to eliminate design failure as a confounder when investigating the relationship between use of cognitive aids and performance. © 2018 Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article).

AB  - In our daily life, the data is ubiquitous. With the advent of the data age, people's lives are closely related to it. Therefore, it is important to use these data for analysis to get effective conclusions. Through the data analysis method, we can analyze the results to do effective decisions-making and applications, more applicable to the interface design. Brain-computer interface (BCI) provides the communicated interface between brain and machines such as computers. It's a technique that the users allowed to interact directly with the machine by using brainwave. The technology includes brainwave (EEG) acquisition, feature extraction and translation algorithm. The researches of BCIs since the 1970s began, the most successful case was Jacques Vidal used brainwave signals to stimulate the visual response and controlled the cursor to take the maze of BCI. Nowadays, it has begun to use in medical aids, and improve the inconvenient situation in daily life. However, the applications in "personalized" BCIs are not popular in our life and less of a data validation to support the user-centric design process to provide. Therefore, this study firstly took the mobile application program of the Lego robot designed by the function as an example.Then used the data of the initial test which was assisted by the Data Analysis Method (DAM). The decision made by DAM was to redesign a data-oriented demonstration and user-centered design process (DAUCD). The Lego robot was integrated hardware and software to develop the learnable and personalized BCI. For usability test, we applied the Lego robots to demonstrate the redesign prototype to conduct the usability test. This study not only designed a personalized BCI but also developed a new data-oriented UCD design process. The brand-new method with DAUCD improved the original design and enhanced the usability test. We expect that this personalized BCI will be applied in medical treatments, businesses and livelihood, promoting the welfare of human being. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - In this paper, the authors draw on methods used in the field of interaction design, emphasizing a user-centred design approach including methods such as usability testing, design metaphors, interview with users, video observations, focus groups, and think aloud sessions. However, a challenge of these methods is that they are designed for adults and are not necessarily appropriate to investigations including children. The guiding questions for this systematic literature review are (1) the motivation for conducting usability tests with children, and (2) the kind of methodological, practical, and ethical considerations that should be considered when involving children in usability studies. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist and PRISMA flow diagram are applied in order to assure the quality of the process of this investigation. Nine articles are analyzed and then synthesized by applying the constant comparative method. The synthesis of the literature review is based on the identified thematic priorities, which are categorized as follows: (1) the motivation for involving children as test persons in design processes, (2) definitions of usability, (3) practical considerations, (4) methodological considerations, and (5) ethical considerations. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2017.

AB  - In this paper we explore whether Social Interdependence Theory (SIT) is a useful theoretical framework to anticipate on challenging intragroup dynamics in co-design with children. According to SIT, there are five principles that mediate the effectiveness of cooperation: positive interdependence, individual accountability, promotive interaction patterns, social skills and group processing. First, we theoretically ground six challenging group dynamics encountered in a previous study. Next, we introduce SIT and describe how we applied each of the five mediating principles in a new case study in which 49 children aged 9 to 10 were involved in a series of co-design sessions. Afterwards, we present our findings and reflect upon the SIT inspired co-design procedure. Finally we touch upon topics for further research and we make a call for more research on SIT in the Child Computer Interaction (CCI) community. © 2015 ACM.

AB  - We are currently engaged in a redesign of the method we use to distribute Engineering Teaching Kits (ETKs) via the Internet. This work in progress reports the results of the user-centered conceptual design phase of the project. ETKs are self-contained STEM education standards-based units that promote integrative learning about STEM via engineering design challenges. The current distribution method, a page on the University of Virginia's course management site, Collab, was adopted based on ease of developer access and use after a successful professional development session at ASEE's K-12 workshop in 2009 resulted in high demand for the presented activities. However, the page has proven to be increasingly unfriendly to users despite several redesigns and reorganizations, the results of which have had limited impact on user accessibility due to Collab's features and functionality. A site that can't be accessed or navigated easily may lead (would-be) users to seek alternatives. This situation is not consistent with our philosophy of sharing materials as open source and with user-centered design values, including the work done by the UI/UX and HCI communities. Our first task in the conceptual design phase was to consult with users via a short survey. We wanted to understand more fully their expectations and needs for a content delivery method and to verify anecdotal feedback we had received over the years to make sure we had identified the problem and project goals correctly. The results will also inform preliminary requirements and be used to develop persona, or user profiles, for use in usability testing. The second task was to investigate current "best practices" in web page design by reviewing popular sites on both traditional and mobile devices. The preliminary requirements based on these results will be used in future design activities. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Usability tests are a part of user-centered design. Usability testing with disabled people is necessary, if they are among the potential users. Several researchers have already investigated usability methods with sighted people. However, research with blind users is insufficient, for example, due to different knowledge on the use of assistive technologies and the ability to analyze usability issues from inspection of non-visual output of assistive devices. From here, the authors aspire to extend theory and practice by investigating four usability methods involving the blind, visually impaired and sighted people. These usability methods comprise of local test, synchronous remote test, tactile paper prototyping and computer-based prototyping. In terms of effectiveness of evaluation and the experience of participants and the facilitator, local tests were compared with synchronous remote tests and tactile paper prototyping with computer-based prototyping. Through the comparison of local and synchronous remote tests, it has been found that the number of usability problems uncovered in different categories with both approaches was comparable. In terms of task completion time, there is a significant difference for blind participants, but not for the visually impaired and sighted. Most of the blind and visually impaired participants prefer the local test. As for the comparison of tactile paper prototyping and computer-based prototyping, it has been revealed that tactile paper prototyping provides a better overview of an application while the interaction with computer-based prototypes is closer to reality. Problems regarding the planning and conducting of these methods as they arise in particular with blind people were also discussed. Based on the authors’ experiences, recommendations were provided for dealing with these problems from both the technical and the organization perspectives. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Today, information systems are radically marked by considerable progress in the areas of software engineering, telecommunications and ubiquitous computing. This has led to the development of new interaction pattern where the service oriented architecture is the de facto pattern. In this article, we are particularly interested in transactional services. We position our approach in the context of a user-centered model driven engineering (MDE) approach in order to move from one perspective where models were contemplative artifacts to a perspective where they become productive artifacts. For this, we first present our approach for managing context-aware transactional services (CATS). Then, we propose a CATS specification and metamodel. The adaptation mechanism is also detailed in this paper. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Security fatigue has been used to describe experiences with online security. This study identifies the affective manifestations resulting from decision fatigue and the role it plays in users' security decisions. A semistructured interview protocol was used to collect data (N = 40). Interview questions addressed online activities; computer security perceptions; and the knowledge and use of security icons, tools, and terminology. Qualitative data techniques were used to code and analyze the data identifying security fatigue and contributing factors, symptoms, and outcomes of fatigue. Although fatigue was not directly part of the interview protocol, more than half of the participants alluded to fatigue in their interviews. Participants expressed a sense of resignation, loss of control, fatalism, risk minimization, and decision avoidance, all characteristics of security fatigue. The authors found that the security fatigue users experience contributes to their cost-benefit analyses in how to incorporate security practices and reinforces their ideas of lack of benefit for following security advice. © 1999-2012 IEEE.

AB  - A lot of smartphone users are still novice and have difficulty in operating tasks using their smartphone, including running applications, for example running an online Arisan application. Arisan is a traditional social gathering that is common in Indonesia. Members of arisan contribute to and take turns at winning, and most of the arisan users are novice users. In this paper, we present the results of our observations to determine problems faced by the novice users when using an online arisan application. The user-centered design approach is employed to analyze the problems and to design the new online arisan application prototype. The prototype is designed based on the usability goal and the user experience defined for the novice users. We conduct a usability testing to evaluate the prototype. The testing results show that the prototype fulfills the usability goal and the user experience. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - User centered design (UCD) provides principles and activities for improving usability. However, traditional UCD methods lack considering the context of users in low income, culturally diverse settings and where Information and Communication Technology (ICT) development is at its infant stage. Software development in low and medium income countries like Ethiopia is characterized by big difference in education and livelihood. Heterogeneous cultures both between different ethnic groups and between rural and urban contexts is another challenge for Ethiopian software development. The paper addresses how to adapt UCD methods and agile development to bridge these heterogeneities. To this end, a multi-case study was implemented, researching two projects in an Ethiopian software company. An action research approach has been complemented by a survey and interviews with other companies. It has resulted in contextualization of UCD practices: personas mediated between rural and urban users and developers. Personas helped also customer representatives as well as product owners to understand users and their requirements and allowed to test releases against persona requirements before deployment. Personas were updated throughout the project based on usability testing and experience from early deployment. Besides personas local IT personnel mediated between the rural users and software developers. Pairwise usability testing is an example for cultural adaptation for discount usability evaluation method that has been tried out. Releasing early version to support personnel and members of the company who are closer to the intended users helped to provide a more adapted version from the start. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - To this day, data-driven science is a widely accepted concept in the digital library (DL) context (Hey et al. in The fourth paradigm: data-intensive scientific discovery. Microsoft Research, 2009). In the same way, domain knowledge from information visualization, visual analytics, and exploratory search has found its way into the DL workflow. This trend is expected to continue, considering future DL challenges such as content-based access to new document types, visual search, and exploration for information landscapes, or big data in general. To cope with these challenges, DL actors need to collaborate with external specialists from different domains to complement each other and succeed in given tasks such as making research data publicly available. Through these interdisciplinary approaches, the DL ecosystem may contribute to applications focused on data-driven science and digital scholarship. In this work, we present VisInfo (2014) , a web-based digital library system (DLS) with the goal to provide visual access to time series research data. Based on an exploratory search (ES) concept (White and Roth in Synth Lect Inf Concepts Retr Serv 1(1):1–98, 2009), VisInfo at first provides a content-based overview visualization of large amounts of time series research data. Further, the system enables the user to define visual queries by example or by sketch. Finally, VisInfo presents visual-interactive capability for the exploration of search results. The development process of VisInfo was based on the user-centered design principle. Experts from computer science, a scientific digital library, usability engineering, and scientists from the earth, and environmental sciences were involved in an interdisciplinary approach. We report on comprehensive user studies in the requirement analysis phase based on paper prototyping, user interviews, screen casts, and user questionnaires. Heuristic evaluations and two usability testing rounds were applied during the system implementation and the deployment phase and certify measurable improvements for our DLS. Based on the lessons learned in VisInfo, we suggest a generalized project workflow that may be applied in related, prospective approaches. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - To develop a Web-based self-care program for patients after total laryngectomy according to a participatory design approach. Methods: We conducted a needs assessment with laryngectomees (n = 9) and their partners (n = 3) by means of a focus group interview. In 4 focus group sessions, a requirement plan was formulated by a team of health care professionals (n = 10) and translated into a prototype. An e-health application was built including illustrated information on functional changes after total laryngectomy as well as video demonstrations of skills and exercises. Usability of the prototype was tested by end users (n = 4) and expert users (n = 10). Interviews were held to elicit the intention to use and the desired implementation strategy. Results: Six main self-care topics were identified: (1) nutrition, (2) tracheostomy care, (3) voice prosthesis care, (4) speech rehabilitation, (5) smell rehabilitation, and (6) mobility of head, neck, and shoulder muscles. Expert users expressed concerns regarding tailored exercises, indicated a positive intent to implement the intervention in routine care, and expressed a need for guidance when implementing the intervention. End users and expert users appreciated the content completeness and multimedia-based information built into the application. Conclusion: The participatory design is a valuable approach to develop a self-care program to help meet users' needs. © 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - People with disabilities face many accessibility problems in their daily lives. One such group of disabled people, children who suffer from cerebral palsy, faces specific challenges, which arise due to motor dysfunction and communication disorders. In the effort to help these children, augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems emerge as solutions to supplement spoken communication or to replace it completely. But current AAC solutions do not always address specific communication needs. Determining how to collaborate directly with cerebral palsy children as partners in the assistive technology design process is still an open research problem. This work discusses the development of an AAC computer-based solution to act as a complement to therapist's AAC activities in helping make the lives of children with disabilities better. The AAC tool is based on symbols located on a computer screen and uses symbol and phrase suggestion strategies aiming to increase communication efficiency. Two school-age students with cerebral palsy participated in this study. Quantitative reports and qualitative assessments from a speech and an occupational therapist are presented. This research deals with a set of accessibility guidelines that benefit researchers and practitioners, giving more evidence about the design of AAC computer-based solutions for people with limited speech or language skills. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Diabetes prevalence has steadily been increasing over the last decades and is expected to continue in this trajectory. Diary keeping is considered the central part of any successful therapy. Since paper-based diary keeping is often poor and electronic diaries often challenging for elderly users, we developed Diabetto. Using focus groups and interviews we analyzed the requirements for Diabetto. It uses a LiveScribe Echo pen as a replacement for a regular pen in traditional paper-based diary keeping, while at the same time adds interactive therapy support and access to a nutrition database through pen-input and text-to-speech. By enhancing an already familiar process we managed to achieve a high acceptance of the device. In an experimental evaluation using an extended TAM model we analyzed the influence of user-diversity factors on the acceptance. Interestingly typical predictors of acceptance, such as efficiency during use, did not influence ease of use, indicating that the digital pen might not be perceived as computerized technology.

AB  - System design and development methods need to be contextualized to the specific needs. Most developing countries are characterized by low economies and infrastructure, complex and heterogeneous culture. In these countries software development is characterized by big differences in education and livelihood. Culture has impacts in ICT development and use. Discount usability methods are lightweight methods to be integrated with agile methods. The paper addresses research questions, what contextual factors in Ethiopia trigger tailoring usability practices, and how can discount usability methods be adapted and integrated into the Scrum-agile development with especial emphasis on the Ethiopian context. The research aims at adapting software engineering and ICT development methods to the specific situation and integrating user-centered design (UCD) and lightweight usability methods into agile development. Two projects have been considered for the empirical research. Cooperative Method Development (CMD) has been used as the research approach. Interview notes, observations and workshop results have been analyzed using thematic coding and qualitative data analysis. Local IT personnel bridged between end users and developers. Culturally adapted user pair testing and heuristic evaluation supported usability testing and supported developers in getting early feedback. Integrated approach of discount usability with the Scrum process has been developed and evaluated first with the involved practitioners and second with expert evaluation. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The most dominant problem experienced by sub-sector of creative economy in Indonesia is funding. Crowdfunding is a new way to get funding through internet. Based on observations, almost all of the world's reward-based crowdfunding is intended for creative industry campaigns, so reward-based crowdfunding is believed to help the development of creative industry in Indonesia. The purpose of this research is to get the design of reward-based crowdfunding website that suits user needs in Indonesia. The Lean Product Process approach, which is the development of Lean Startup, is used to get the appropriate website design. There are six stages in the Lean Product Process framework with different methods in each stage. The methods used in this study were Persona, Kano Model, Product Value Proposition, User Stories, User Experience Design Framework, and Usability Testing. This study conducted two iterations. In the first iteration, website design of clickable mockup was obtained, while in the second iteration web site design of interactive prototype was obtained. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Designing training tools for complex jobs within military domains can be challenging. Training for aircraft maintainers, in particular, requires detailed instruction and guidance from job guides, instructors and aircraft equipment. These approaches are often inefficient, outdated and resource-intensive. Gaming and simulation can provide many of the necessary support capabilities to facilitate more cost-efficient, timely, engaging and effective training. Because current maintenance training procedures follow a very hands-on approach in terms of instructor and student involvement, it is essential that development of game-based training technologies is undertaken with these end users in mind. This chapter describes how iterative usability testing was employed throughout the development process for two software applications created for aircraft maintenance training. It also describes how a user-centered design approach supported the development of these game-based programs for superior training methods and experiences for all end users, including instructors, students and administrators. © 2018, IGI Global.

AB  - This study aimed to apply gesture-based cognition learning technology to develop an educational training support system (G-NETS) for physical assessment practicum. The processes of G-NETS system development can be divided into two stages: user-centered design (UCD) development and system verification. Eventually, the quantitative and qualitative analysis is conducted to evaluate nursing students learning performance, attitude, cognitive load, and technology acceptance. Results reveal that G-NETS can help the clinical nursing instructors to access the learners’ information easily, to monitor the student’s learning behavior in clinical courses, and to give them timely support and feedbacks accordingly. That in turn can reduce the percentage of mistakes and increase the quality of clinical practicum learning process. In the future, this study can be applied to clinical education, the training of new clinical nursing staff, other subjects of clinical practicum training, which expand the beneficial results of practical training and clinical teaching. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - This paper presents a structured User Centered Design (UCD) method to design and develop a highly usable smart home platform to manage the energy consumption of connected appliances. It exploits advanced Tangible Augmented Reality (TAR) technologies to virtually prototype the conceived design solutions and carry out usability testing with sample users. Usability tests are carried out both on traditional high fidelity prototypes and on an innovative Tangible Augmented Reality prototype. Experimental results prove the efficiency of the UCD approach supported by virtual prototypes, instead of traditional ones, the reliability of TAR prototypes to detect usability problems and assess user satisfaction, and its high interaction quality. Advantages obtainable by implementing the proposed structured UCD approach for web interface design, in the context of smart home, are discussed. © 2017 ACM.

AB  - Green IT products collect personal small data by wearable computing and Quantified Self, Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Everything (IoE) link the small data with the big data, and transform the user experience from User-Centered Design (UCD) into User Participated (Involved or engagement) Design (UPD). To collect the seamless and sustainable UPD small data, we use the wearable computing sensors and applications for small data mining, filter, information visualization and interaction design. By information sorting the wearable computing into five types (in me, on me, with me, around me, beyond me), we intend to design the user experience in a sustainable way by Quantified Self. With the context awareness, conscious awareness and emotion awareness, we use LBS (location-based service) to construct context awareness, set up big five personalities and Enneagram to deal with the data of conscious awareness. For the Green IT Products, we set up the eco system information architecture and agile interaction model for the user experience design, we also use pre-conscious, subconscious and conscious awareness big data to analyze and predict the long-term impaction factors for the user experience and users’ intuitive interaction. From the strategy level, structure level, framework level and visual level, we point out the Meaning-Centered Design methodology to dig out the user experience design for the Green IT Products, green and live information architecture for the life cycle evaluation for the Green IT products, figure out the stakeholder and interaction logic moving line by mapping the mental model for the diversified users’ agile transformation needs, emotions and interaction feedback, provide the mass customization and crowds innovation contents to support the Green IT products and Product Service System (PSS), modify the quality of the real physical products and enrich the virtual reality digital information contents to prolong the life cycle of the Green IT Products. By decreasing the carbon footprint and increasing the three flows (information flow, logistics, financial flow) chain touchpoints, we find the painpoints and design the good user experience for the real people. We construct the user engagement innovation platform and transform the users’ function with duality role player with user and designer. For the evaluation of the user experience, we change the scenario role player design into ‘real design for real people’, and with the agile interaction and intuitive interaction, we modify the user experience with the real time high-fidelity prototype and iterative usability testing. In the pilot study, we design the smart clothes and interactive stage, props to collect the dancer’s small data about the heart-beat, EMG, EEG, motion, body gesture, emotion and the audience feedback such as the sound of clapping, the environment light change, the audience moving line and the air smog haze index. We use the module and separate design for the clothes and sensors, memory metal, fiber-optical to balance the clothes light change, clothes form transformation and small data visualization. On the one hand, the clothes can collect the dancer’s action data in an active way, at the same time, the clothes also interact with the dancer, the audience and the stage environment to support the digital contents of the dance. One clothes can express the five scenes of the dance in a sustainable way. And because of the separate design, the clothes and the sensors play the role in a parallel way to leave the dancer plenty of free uncertainty expression space. That win-win design support the real and virtual parts life cycle for the Green IT Products. We use the expert review, heuristic evaluation, big data visual analytics and usability testing for the user experience design evaluation and design the third version for the smart clothes and interactive stage. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - This paper presents a process for designing an online Community of Practice (CoP) system for nurses. First, we used Value Sensitive Design by identifying the four features: benefits, harms, future trend, and pervasiveness of the CoP system to stakeholders. Next, we created two personas that represent direct stakeholders. We then incorporated the four features and personas into value scenarios. Based on the needs and barriers of potential users described in the scenarios, we created a paper prototype and evaluated its usability using three approaches: heuristic evaluation (HE), Wizard-of-Oz, and surveys. Our findings from the HE and Wizard-of-Oz methods demonstrated design flaws, as well as users' needs and barriers in interacting with the prototype. To sum up, this paper demonstrates a design process using personas and Value Sensitive Design. We also show an evaluation process using multiple usability testing methods that could be potentially used in the early stage of development. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - In this research we developed an alarm system that enables assistance dogs to call for help on behalf of their vulnerable owners in an emergency, involving the end users (both assistance dogs and their owners) directly in the entire design process. Here we present a high-fidelity prototype of a user-friendly canine alarm system. In developing the system, we sought to understand the level of support required for a canine user to successfully interact with an interface, finding that the type of emergency a dog is faced with may vary widely and that consequently dogs may have to act on behalf of their assisted owners with varying degrees of autonomy. We also explored the process of conducting usability testing with both canine and human participants, seeking to identify where requirements of one species may overlap with, or diverge from, the other. © 2015 ACM.

AB  - The marriage of Agile development processes and User-Centered Design (UCD) has been increasingly attracting interest within the field of software development [1]. Integrating the two can identify the benefits of each in terms of efficient work processes to achieve useful and at the same time usable products as results. While the user-centered design process has a defined structure [2], the understanding of user experience and user interface teams vary significantly across organizations [3]. Similarly, design processes are defined differently per organization without a universal model. For certain teams the User eXperience (UX) team means an entity of all user-related and design-related activities, including user research, benchmarking, creating information architecture, projecting user needs into wireframes, creating user interface visual designs and evaluating with usability testings. Other organizations have differentiated User Research specialists (involved in user insights and usability topics) from User eXperience teams (specified on translating user needs into screens) and User Interface (visual representations of tasks) teams. To our knowledge, very little research has been done regarding such intricacies of team structures when discussing user experience teams in the Agile and UCD integration frameworks. Our paper provides a review of different UI/UX team structures in organizations and their implications in the implementation of projects. With our analysis of different team and role structures we hope to contribute to better understanding of UI/UX teams in design agencies and the influence of this understanding on the success of projects incorporating UCD and agile approaches. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - The mobile market in China has boomed recently. In using UCD methods in enterprises, however, Chinese practitioners are faced with challenges in both design and research, given the fast iterative pace and an inflating number of features in applications. In this context, the article aims to present an agile, solid and integrated approach to valid mobile designs, integrating online experimentation, survey and usability testing. It will also present an empirical example using the methodology to push forward an innovative design in Baidu Map for Mobile. The example described how we understand major influences of the new designs through a series of studies over half-a-month, and moved forward to improve and finally realize the designs. The article also summarizes some insights we gained in the practice. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Preventable medical errors in hospitals are the third leading cause of death in the United States. Many of these are caused by poor situational awareness, especially in acute care resuscitation scenarios. While a number of checklists and technological interventions have been developed to reduce cognitive load and improve situational awareness, these tools often do not fit the clinical workflow. To better understand the challenges faced by clinicians in acute care codes, we conducted a qualitative study with interprofessional clinicians at three regional hospitals. Our key findings are: Current documentation processes are inadequate (with information recorded on paper towels); reference guides can serve as fixation points, reducing rather than enhancing situational awareness; the physical environment imposes significant constraints on workflow; homegrown solutions may be used often to solve unstandardized processes; simulation scenarios do not match real-world practice. We present a number of considerations for collaborative healthcare technology design and discuss the implications of our findings on current work for the development of more effective interventions for acute care resuscitation scenarios. © 2015 ICST.
