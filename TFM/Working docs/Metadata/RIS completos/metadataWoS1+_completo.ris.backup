AB  - The research focuses on the limitations of traditional systems in optimizing information flow in the healthcare domain. It focuses on integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) and utilizing AI-powered applications, specifically conversational agents (CAs), particularly during peak operational hours in emergency departments (EDs). Leveraging the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework, the authors tailored a customized methodology, CRISP-knowledge graph (CRISP-KG), designed to harness KGs for constructing an intelligent knowledge base (KB) for CAs. This KG augmentation empowers CAs with advanced reasoning, knowledge management, and context awareness abilities. We utilized a hybrid method integrating a participatory design collaborative methodology (CM) and Methontology to construct a domain-centric robust formal ontological model depicting and mapping information flow during peak hours in EDs. The ultimate objective is to empower CAs with intelligent KBs, enabling seamless interaction with end users and enhancing the quality of care within EDs. The authors leveraged semantic web rule language (SWRL) to enhance inferencing capabilities within the KG framework further, facilitating efficient information management for assisting healthcare practitioners and patients. This innovative assistive solution helps efficiently manage information flow and information provision during peak hours. It also leads to better care outcomes and streamlined workflows within EDs.

AB  - Dietary supplements (DS) are widely used. However, consumers know little about the safety and efficacy of DS. There is a growing interest in accessing health information online; however, online health information, especially information on DSs, is scattered with varying levels of quality. We prototyped a web application, ALOHA, with interactive graph-based visualizations to facilitate users' browsing of the integrated DIetary Supplement Knowledge base (iDISK) curated from scientific resources, following an iterative user-centered design (UCD) process.

AB  - With the rapid development of information technology (IT), especially after the wide application of 5G and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, community management has begun to actively explore the integration of IT. In this study, we analyzed 717 English articles on the topic of "smart community" in the Web of Science database by combining bibliometrics and traditional review methods. Using Citespace software, we explored the literature in terms of co-citation, keyword co-occurrence, literature clustering, and author-institution cooperation to identify eight key areas of smart community research, and established a comprehensive research framework accordingly. Based on this framework, this paper further provides a comprehensive analysis of key research themes and hot issues. The study shows that the current research focus on smart communities is mainly on how to effectively integrate smart technologies into community governance. With the further development of IoT and AI technologies, smart communities will focus more on civic engagement, social innovation, healthy communities and digital health, as well as smart economy and entrepreneurial ecology. These areas are expected to be potential points for future research.

AB  - Introduction We present a prototype solution for improving transparency and quality assurance of the data linkage process through data provenance tracking designed to assist Data Analysts, researchers and information governance teams in authenticating and auditing data workflows within a Trusted Research Environment (TRE). Methods Using a participatory design process with Data Analysts, researchers and information governance teams, we undertook a contextual inquiry, user requirements interviews, co-design workshops, low-fidelity prototype evaluations. Public Engagement and Involvement activities underpinned the methods to ensure the project and approaches met the public's trust for semi-automating data processing. These helped inform methods for technical implementation, applying the PROV-O ontology to create a derived ontology following the four-step Linked Open Terms methodology and development of automated scripts to collect provenance information for the data processing workflow. Results The resulting Provenance Explorer for Trusted Research Environments (PE-TRE) interactive tool displays the data linkage information extracted from a knowledge graph described using the derived SHP ontology and results of rule-based validation checks. User evaluations confirmed PE-TRE would contribute to better quality data linkage and reduce data processing errors. Conclusion This project demonstrates the next stage in advancing transparency and quality assurance within TREs by semi-automating and systematising data tracking in a single tool throughout the data processing lifecycle, improving transparency, openness and quality assurance.

KW  - Dewey decimal classification
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study is to develop a conceptual model, ProvKOS, for tracking the provenance of change activities in a knowledge organization system (KOS). By extending current provenance practices, this model represents dynamic changes in a KOS more effectively.Design/methodology/approachWe take a five-step approach to develop the conceptual model, including content analysis of KOS editorial data, environmental scan of existing provenance models, development of persona-specific provenance questions and a participatory design with stakeholders to ensure the model's utility.FindingsWe introduce (1) a taxonomy of editorial activities for a KOS; (2) a conceptual model ProvKOS, which extends existing models PROV and Simple Knowledge Organization Systems (SKOS). We also provide detailed data dictionaries for the entities, activities and warrants classes proposed in the model. A use case on "gender dysphoria" in Dewey Decimal Classifications (DDCs) is provided to illustrate the implementation of ProvKOS. This shows ProvKOS's ability to capture KOS changes effectively and to link external resources relating to the changes.Research limitations/implicationsFurther validation may be needed to implement the ProvKOS model across various types of KOSs.Practical implicationsProvKOS can help improve machine readability, querying and analysis of a KOS. Especially within the linked data environment, the enhanced provenance documentation through ProvKOS can enable a network of KOSs, which will then inform better linked data or knowledge graph designs.Social implicationsBy facilitating better tracking of changes within a KOS and across KOSs, ProvKOS can enhance the accessibility and usability of knowledge bases across different cultural and social contexts, thus better supporting inclusive information practices.Originality/valueThe proposed model is novel in two ways: one, its ability to represent dynamic change activities in a KOS, which has not been discussed anywhere else; two, it supports the interconnectivity across KOSs by providing a "warrant" class to substantiate the context of changes.

AB  - Under the umbrella of the SEE/B/0016/4.3/X Project SAGITTARIUS a new cultural heritage infrastructure has been introduced in South East Europe. The main aim is to facilitate cognitive-emotional experiences in cultural heritage environments by effectively communicating cultural values to non-captives audiences. A 3-component Roving Museum (RM) is operated in seven countries (GR, BG, HR, HU, IT, RO). The RM adapts to visitor needs in a constantly changing knowledge ecosystem implementing new ways of recreational learning and visitor satisfaction. It includes a QRC-driven portable exhibition with 110 cultural heritage narratives, accessible via QRCs in the territory, an app for iOS and Android, and a social media driven participatory space, to support contextual co-creation and participatory learning. A cognitive driven communication pattern has been developed and adapted to the conditions regulating the recreational learning environment. The pattern employs interrelated content segments in order to free the working memory (WM) from irrelevant cognitive loads, enabling new cognitive content to relate to prior knowledge. The design presupposes a limited WM capacity to deal with visual, auditory and verbal material, and an almost unlimited long-term memory (LTM), able to hold mental representations that vary in their degree of automation. It considers WM constraints, element interactivity and 3 types of cognitive loads (CL). Cognitive accessibility is ensured through provision of novelty and variety, surprise and exploration, strictly avoiding engagement in complex cognitive procedures. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: Patient decision aids (PtDAs) can support shared decision-making (SDM) by providing information about options, pros and cons and eliciting personal preferences. The aim of this study was to develop and test the acceptability and usability of a PtDA for patients with metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the most common type of metastatic kidney cancer. Methods: User-centered mixed methods design. Co-creation process with stakeholders guided by the International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) criteria, consisting of three main elements: (a) a needs assessment; (b) acceptability and usability testing; and (c) compatibility assessment with IPDAS criteria. Results: Thirteen RCC patients and 29 healthcare professionals (HCP) participated in this study. Co-creation sessions were held with nine HCPs and a patient representative. Needs assessment (a) showed that patients lacked real treatment choices and wanted information on all treatment options, including life expectancy, side effects, psychological, and lifestyle advice. HCPs expect a PtDA to improve information delivery and patient engagement. A three-component PtDA was developed and tested (b), with positive feedback from both patients and professionals. The tool meets all 12 IPDAS criteria (c). Conclusions: The web-based PtDA was developed and adapted to address unmet needs and found to be acceptable and usable by patients and HCPs. Practice implications: The use of this tool could contribute to high quality, patient-centered and appropriate care for metastatic clear cell RCC patients in the Netherlands.

AB  - People increasingly view mobility as a service and want more choices for traveling between points A and B. Designing user experiences of future robo-taxi needs to be seen from a broad perspective and consider an extended user journey. Our work explores the application of quick and dirty prototyping and usability testing to design UX of future robo-taxi services from the ground up. We made low-fidelity prototypes early in the design process and quickly tested with users iteratively to answer initial questions arisen on critical touchpoints in the user journey. Two critical touchpoints are rider-driverless car match and in-car environment configuration. Five optional eHMI (external HMI) were tested, and our results suggest combining options depending on the distance between the vehicle and the passenger. We also tested two environment templates and found that preference depends on travel time regardless of the purpose of the journey. Finally, we suggest a service scenario composed of 14 scenes.

AB  - As cities embrace smart technologies for urban development, the demand for new urban mobility solutions grows. However, capturing and prioritising diverse citizen needs poses challenges. In response, we introduce a serious tabletop game tailored for urban mobility requirements engineering. Our research aims to design and evaluate the effectiveness of this game in facilitating user engagement and optimising the elicitation, prioritisation and analysis of requirements in the context of urban mobility solutions. Our approach builds on previous serious gaming studies while focusing on citizen engagement and customisation for urban contexts. The game comprises collaborative activities using a co-design canvas. Through iterative playtesting and usability testing, the game's design is refined.

AB  - The utilization of decision support systems, in the point of care, to alert drug-drug interactions has been shown to improve quality of care. Still, the use of these systems has not been as expected, it is believed, because of the difficulties in their knowledge databases; errors in the generation of the alerts and the lack of a suitable design. This study expands on the development of alerts using participatory design techniques based on user centered design process. This work was undertaken in three stages (inquiry, participatory design and usability testing) it showed that the use of these techniques improves satisfaction, effectiveness and efficiency in an alert system for drug-drug interactions, a fact that was evident in specific situations such as the decrease of errors to meet the specified task, the time, the workload optimization and users overall satisfaction in the system.

AB  - Learning to use geographic information system (GIS) software effectively may be intimidating due to the extensive range of features it offers. The GRASS GIS software, in particular, presents additional challenges for first-time users in terms of its complex startup procedure and unique terminology associated with its data structure. On the other hand, a substantial part of the GRASS user community including us as developers recognized and embraced the advantages of the current approach. Given the controversial nature of the whole issue, we decided to actively involve regular users by conducting several formal surveys and by performing usability testing. Throughout this process, we discovered that resolving specific software issues through pure user-centered design is not always feasible, particularly in the context of open-source scientific software where the boundary between users and developers is very fuzzy. To address this challenge, we adopted the user-centered methodology tailored to the requirements of open-source scientific software development, which we refer to as community-driven design. This paper describes the community-driven redesigning process on the GRASS GIS case study and sets a foundation for applying community-driven design in other open-source scientific projects by providing insights into effective software development practices driven by the needs and input of the project's community.

AB  - For increasingly frequent use of library resources by remote users, remote usability testing has become a valuable tool for those who would pursue an empirical, user-centered design of the interfaces to their electronic resources and services. This paper describes our implementation of remote usability tests to evaluate prototypes of a web content management application developed by Vignette Corporation, and reports sample results to illustrate the utility of such an approach that can help designing and improving interfaces of digital library projects and their usability.

AB  - Traditional usability methods are of limited use when evaluating systems designed for distant, diverse populations. In this paper, we describe a study conducted in two Ghanaian villages that evaluated an audio computer designed for people living in oral cultures. Informed by ICTD and orality-grounded HCID, we modified existing usability testing practices and we reflect on the utility of these adaptations. We found that conducting a culturally appropriate study often meant forgoing more traditional approaches in favor of flexible, opportunistic methods. We acknowledge the challenges of adapting traditional usability methods for oral, rural users. However, we found that by implementing strategic modifications led by local staff, our study produced valuable, actionable results.

AB  - A lot of smartphone users are still novice and have difficulty in operating tasks using their smartphone, including running applications, for example running an online Arisan application. Arisan is a traditional social gathering that is common in Indonesia. Members of arisan contribute to and take turns at winning, and most of the arisan users are novice users. In this paper, we present the results of our observations to determine problems faced by the novice users when using an online arisan application. The user-centered design approach is employed to analyze the problems and to design the new online arisan application prototype. The prototype is designed based on the usability goal and the user experience defined for the novice users. We conduct a usability testing to evaluate the prototype. The testing results show that the prototype fulfills the usability goal and the user experience.

AB  - Emerging technologies have played an important role in driving major changes in human society. However, the advent of most technologies is typically initially accompanied by confusion; this is often because technology developers overlook the user perspective. This study was conducted to systematically determine the fundamental causes of problems that users encounter when they interact with blockchain technology, one of the promising emerging technologies today, and to suggest relevant design strategies. To this end, usability evaluation was conducted for the KDEX decentralized exchange application. To ensure the effective identification of the significant usability problems, heuristic evaluation with four experts and usability testing with 23 experimental participants were carried out. The results obtained show that more user-centered design is necessary to enable the widespread use of decentralized applications. Based on the experimental findings, actionable design strategies that facilitate the effective utilization of emerging technologies are suggested. The proposed strategies are expected to enable users to easily understand and navigate applications based on these technologies.

AB  - Chatbot-based conversational commerce which allows buyers to do online shopping by conversing with chatbot through messaging application has been growing in the e-commerce industry. However, based on studies conducted in this paper, findings show that interaction design of the existing conversational commerce are still lacking in various areas. Therefore, an interaction and interface design for chatbot-based conversational commerce are developed in this study using user-centered design. The outcome of this study is a prototype that fulfills the usability goal and the user experience goal defined for chatbot-based conversational commerce on mobile platform especially for Indonesian users. We conduct usability testing to evaluate the prototype. The results show that the prototype fulfills the defined usability goals and user experience goals as 100% users agree that the prototype is effective to use, efficient to use, easy to learn, enjoyable and helpful, although only 83.3% users agree that the prototype is safe to use.

AB  - With the growing awareness to learn deeper about Islam and Quran, there is an increasing trend to learn the Arabic language in Indonesia. While many institutions offer onsite learning platform to learn Arabic, the need for technology-based e-learning Arabic course is increasing as technology in Indonesia advances. The e-learning approach has to be based upon the needs of users to ensure the learning is effective. This study aims to design an online e-learning basic Arabic course using user-centered design (UCD) approach. The methodology employed in this study is mixed methods. The study covers requirements gathering, create design solution, prototyping, and evaluation. Gagne's nine instructional events are used as a theoretical basis for designing Instructional design. Evaluation is done by referring to usability testing method. This study results in an e-learning Arabic course interface that stemmed from user needs and instructional design. The final output has 17 features out of 34 identified user needs.

AB  - Objectives: Readmission following colorectal surgery, typically due to surgery-related complications, is common. Patient-centered discharge warnings may guide recognition of early complication signs after colorectal surgery.
   Materials and Methods: User-centered design of a discharge warnings tool consisted of iterative health literacy review and a heuristic evaluation with human factors and clinical experts as well as patient end users to establish content validity and usability.
   Results: Literacy evaluation of the prototype suggested>12th-grade reading level. Subsequent revisions reduced reading level to 8th grade or below. Contents were formatted during heuristic evaluation into 3 action-oriented zones (green, yellow, and red) with relevant warning lexicons. Usability testing demonstrated comprehension of this 3-level lexicon and recognition of appropriate patient actions to take for each level.
   Discussion: We developed a discharge warnings tool for colorectal surgery using staged user-centered design. The lexicon of surgical discharge warnings could structure communication among patients, caregivers, and clinicians to improve post-discharge care.

AB  - Diabetes management applications effectively help patients monitor blood glucose levels and adjust diet and exercise plans. However, most diabetes management apps, including the SugarShift application developed in 2023, use generalized designs that often fail to consider the unique cognitive and physiological characteristics of elderly users, thereby impacting their acceptance and usage. This paper proposes an enhancement for the SugarShift application by introducing a mode specifically designed for elderly users. This proposed enhancement aims to directly involve elderly patients so as to meet their needs better through a participatory design approach. A heuristic evaluation conducted with six experts identified 126 usability issues and 179 heuristic violations in the current version, which has led to the recommendation to develop optimization strategies tailored for elderly users. Subsequent usability testing with 28 elderly patients and six experts emphasized the importance of interface simplicity, logical operation, and interaction quality in enhancing user experience. These factors improve usability, facilitate information processing, and reduce cognitive load. Despite the overall usability of SUS scores, significant challenges still need to be addressed in information display, system feedback, and user interaction. Recommendations for future enhancements include simplifying data entry and presentation, improving readability, and providing timely feedback to enhance usability and user satisfaction, ultimately increasing user retention.

AB  - Despite basic federal requirements promoting a user-centered design approach to electronic health record (EHR) development and usability testing there have been usability and safety risks with EHR technology. Four EHR vendors were asked to provide written descriptions of their usability practices, and we reviewed these descriptions to identify areas where there has been advancement and areas for improvement. All 4 vendors described user-centered design processes and usability testing methods that demonstrate advancement from previous studies of vendor practices. Importantly, vendors are also beginning to address aspects of EHR implementation that play a critical role in shaping EHR usability. There are important areas for improvement in vendor practices including a greater focus on safety and on measurement and benchmarking. Vendors sharing their current usability practices demonstrates a step toward greater transparency which has typically been lacking.

AB  - Guidance and counseling services have an important role in moral assistance and directing students' talents and interests. The Covid-19 pandemic has hampered Counseling Guidance services because learning activities are carried out online. This study aims to conduct a UI and UX assessment of the counseling application based on the Cased Based Reasoning algorithm called B-Talk This application was developed with a mobile platform design. Infernalities than the approach used is the User-Centered Design (UCD). The UCD approach is an approach that uses factors human, knowledge of usability techniques, and an interactive approach to developing design and systems. The UI(User Interface) and UX(User Experience) designs that have been produced will be tested with an expert assessment of Counseling Guidance which includes two aspects, namely usability testing and User Experience Question (UEQ). The media validation assessment was obtained from an average value of 89.2% of the standard feasibility without revision. In this case, it can be concluded that the B-Talk application design can be used as its function for Counseling Guidance media for adolescents.

AB  - Usability testing has become one of the key aspects of user centered design. It typically employs various lab setups equipped with cameras and other devices to monitor the user's interactions with the software. Psychology studies on Electronic Performance Monitoring suggest that the more monitoring equipment used, the higher the anxiety levels of the person being observed. This study observed how usability labs employing various methods of user monitoring affected user anxiety levels and performance. If increased anxiety levels are causing users to make more errors, then the lab environment could be impacting the results of usability testing. The study examined three groups of subjects performing a usability test under different electronic and direct monitoring conditions. Each lab had significantly different layouts and employed different methods of monitoring. The labs were designed to be increasingly more intrusive in the monitoring set-ups. The study measured the anxiety levels of all participants after the test and counted the number of errors made. There were statistically significant differences, suggesting that lab environment can impact usability test results.

AB  - Laws are formed by having a purpose, one of which is to obtain legal certainty in which legal awareness of the public become necessary. Several attempt to increase legal literacy is carried out through socialization, one of them in the form of an electronic consultation application on criminal law in Indonesia. Although there are several applications that present the legal case and information, there has not been much impact towards the primary intention and goal due to its offered features are still lacking related to how users utilize the application or called UX (User Experience). In this study, the design of an application is using the UX approach with the UCD (User Centered Design) method, then testing is conducted by usability evaluation. Among 3 (three) kind of designs using usability testing through scenario analysis resulted to the last design as the best alternative because it has the lowest severity of the problem.

AB  - Children aged 10-12 years old are considered able to know and do first-aid. At those ages, children have been exposed to various learning medias. One of learning medias is game applications. Based on preliminary observations, by testing usability of existing game apps, User Interface is considered not good. Therefore, the users cannot use the application properly. This is caused by several factors. They are effectiveness, productivity, accessibility and universality. Applications that have low usability can be caused by the imperfection or insufficient of the application suitability with the needs of the user. In order to fit the user interface to the needs of the user, it is necessary to model the user interface of the first-aid application game using User Centered Design (UCD) method. Using UCD is used to generate a User Interface model that fits to the needs of the user. The modeling of the game application is formed in a prototype. After that, a test is conducted to the user to measure the usability of the game by using Quality in Use Integrated Measurement (QUIM). The results of usability testing is 81.05%.

AB  - Computer-assisted interviewing (CAI) has a substantial impact on the way interviewers carry out the task of interviewing. Survey instruments are becoming more complex, necessitating new skills of interviewers. In addition to question wording, the design of CAI instruments is a focus of evaluation and pretesting efforts. This article reports on a variety of research activities related to the usability testing of CAI instruments, focusing both on interviewers (in interviewer-administered surveys) and respondents (in self-administered surveys). The article introduces practices and procedures of usability testing, illustrated with examples from several recent studies in which these methods were applied to the evaluation of computerized survey instruments.

AB  - People with hearing loss have limitation in communication. According to this study in SLB-B Cicendo Bandung, Indonesia, most of the deaf students are enthusiastic to learn English. Meanwhile, they consider learning English is very hard because of the differences in pronunciation and spelling. In Indonesia, the education media to learn English is not developed much. The aim is to deliver proper interaction and user interface design for education media to help deaf youths learning English. This study uses user-centered design approach because deaf youths are unique. The proposed design for this study is a conceptual model using gamification, repetition, and leveling concept. This conceptual model uses picture, lip-reading video, text, and sign language to help users understand the contents. For usability testing, the design was implemented into high-fidelity prototype of hybrid mobile application. The result showed that the design of the prototype was already suited to most of the proposed usability goals and user experiences.

AB  - The use of mobile devices in healthcare is increasing in prevalence and poses different constraints for use than traditional desktop computing. This chapter introduces several usability testing methods that are appropriate for use when designing and developing mobile technologies. Approaching the development of mobile technologies through a user-centered approach is critical to improve the interaction and use of the hardware and software that is implemented on a mobile platform in healthcare. User-centered design adds value by getting feedback about functionality, design, and constraints that need to be built into the system prior to its completion. Future work in this domain will require further tailoring and use of novel usability methods to evaluate and improve the design of mobile healthcare technologies.

AB  - The number of people with learning disabilities in Thailand continues to increase and the software tools to enhance them in their reading, writing, intellectual capacity and calculating are still very limit. Therefore our institute (Rehabilitative Engineering and Assistive Technology Institute: REAT) will develop seven software tools such as (i) Thai Talking Word Prediction Program, (ii) Thai Talking Word Spelling Program, (iii) Thai Talking Word Processor Program, (iv) Thai Spell Checker Program, (v) Thai Organization Writer Program, (vi) Thai Talking OCR Program, and (vii) Thai Talking Mathematics Program. The development process for these tools will take 3.5 years. During the first year, Thai Talking Word Prediction Program and Thai Talking Word Spelling Program, the application programs used with word processor will be developed.

AB  - Many applications are developed to assist in practicing zero waste, but the number of users for such applications is few. In this research, interaction for a new zero-waste application that uses gamification was designed to increase the number of users. The usage of gamification focused on cooperative elements because the practice of zero waste involves collaboration to achieve a mutual goal of decreasing waste. The design process used a user-centered design (UCD) approach, with the final product in a prototype application for a mobile device. The interface design aims for effectiveness and utility as usability goals, while its user experience goals are helpful and motivating. Based on usability testing conducted on the prototype, it is concluded that cooperative gamification elements usable in zero-waste applications include user groups, user roles, group-based goals, and cumulative points. The achievement of usability and user experience goals is measured using several metrics. They are success rate, single ease questions (SEQ), System Usability Scale (SUS), Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) subscale Value/Usefulness, and IMI subscale Interest/Enjoyment for measuring motivation.

AB  - digital eye strain is a combination of eye or vision problems associated with the use of digital screens. In addition, DES can reduce productivity and quality of life. Basically, DES is caused by the high intensity use of digital screens. Since the spread of COVID-19 increased in Indonesia, the duration of using digital screens has increased dramatically, which increases the risk of DES. Currently, there are many eye health apps in the community. However, existing apps still cannot meet their goals and needs, especially helping to maintain their motivation for eye health. Therefore, BetterEyes is designed with a user-centered design approach with gamification to keep them motivated. Survey research and user interviews were conducted to understand their behavior and problems. Usability testing are conducted in each iteration to evaluate the usability goals (effective to use and easy to learn) and user experience goals (motivating). The results in the last iteration showed the prototype designed was effective (100% completion rate), easy to learn (SEQ score 6.7 out of 7), and motivating (IMI score 6.09 out of 7). In addition, the overall usability aspect of the prototype is also categorized in the acceptable with an A score (SUS score 97.5 out of 100). Based on these results, it can be concluded that the designs are able to meet the goals and needs of the users in protecting their eyes from DES.

AB  - Objective: Currently, there are few resources for electronic health record (EHR) purchasers and end users to understand the usability processes employed by EHR vendors during product design and development. We developed a framework, based on human factors literature and industry standards, to systematically evaluate the user-centered design processes and usability testing methods used by EHR vendors.
   Materials and Methods: We reviewed current usability certification requirements and the human factors literature to develop a 15-point framework for evaluating EHR products. The framework is based on 3 dimensions: user-centered design process, summative testing methodology, and summative testing results. Two vendor usability reports were retrieved from the Office of the National Coordinator's Certified Health IT Product List and were evaluated using the framework.
   Results: One vendor scored low on the framework (5 pts) while the other vendor scored high on the framework (15 pts). The 2 scored vendor reports demonstrate the framework's ability to discriminate between the variabilities in vendor processes and to determine which vendors are meeting best practices.
   Discussion: The framework provides a method to more easily comprehend EHR vendors' usability processes and serves to highlight where EHR vendors may be falling short in terms of best practices. The framework provides a greater level of transparency for both purchasers and end users of EHRs. Conclusion: The framework highlights the need for clearer certification requirements and suggests that the authorized certification bodies that examine vendor usability reports may need to be provided with clearer guidance.

AB  - Background: Medication discrepancies, which are a threat to patient safety, can be reduced by medication reconciliation (MedRec). MedRec is a complex process that can be supported by the use of information technology and patient engagement. Therefore, the SEAMPAT project aims to develop a MedRec IT platform based on two applications. The application for the professionals is called: the "MedRec app".
   Objective: In the present study, we aimed to describe the development and usability testing of the MedRec app, reporting results of a three iterations user-centered usability evaluation.
   Methods: We used a three phase iterative user-centered study spread over 16 months. At each phase, the usability evaluation included several methods (observations, questionnaires, and follow-up discussions with participants) to collect quantitative and qualitative data in order to improve the current prototype and evolve to the next prototype.
   Results: In total, 48 healthcare professionals (25 general practitioners and 23 hospital clinicians) participated to the MedRec app evaluation. There were 14, 32 and 5 participants for phases 1, 2 and 3 respectively. At each phase, many design modifications were done to strengthen usability. Concerning usability, participants considered the prototypes as an acceptable interface with a median System Usability Score of 73 at phase 2 and 75 at phase 3. Participants emphasized the need for improvements concerning workflow integration, usefulness and interoperability.
   Conclusion: The MedRec app was perceived as being useful, usable and satisfying. However, further improvements are required in several usability aspects. Our study demonstrates the importance of conducting usability assessments before investing time and resources in a large study evaluating the effect of an eMedRec approach on clinical outcomes. Our findings may also increase the chances of acceptability and sustained use over time by clinicians.

AB  - Dekoruma is an Indonesia-based home and living e-Commerce with an urgency to improve the quality of service and shopping experience for its customers. This study is conducted to evaluate usability aspects of Dekoruma's current e-Commerce site and propose an alternative design to improve the usability. The methods used for data collection and analysis in this study are the mixed method approach, and the alternative design development is conducted using the User-Centered Design (UCD) approach. The quantitative data are collected through online questionnaires addressing users' demographic data and behavior in using Dekoruma website and System Usability Scale. Usability testing is conducted to collect qualitative data directly from end-users. Identified usability problems are mapped to relate interface design principles. Proposed solutions are built into a high fidelity prototype as the end result. The usability testing of the alternative design shows that most of the proposed solutions are able to solve usability problems encountered beforehand. Further improvement is still needed on product filter and product detail features.

AB  - The Chinese government has developed a unique "Smart Eldercare" model that utilizes digital technologies to address the growing needs of its rapidly aging population. To implement this model, the government has initiated policies to accelerate talent cultivation, highlighting the importance of Smart Eldercare education at different levels in universities and vocational schools. This paper presents the design and development of an aging scenario Wiki and conducts a usability evaluation of this Wiki as a collaborative learning tool for nascent Smart Eldercare education. First, during the development phase, we conducted lab-based usability testing using 18 tasks of 3 types with 12 student participants who followed the think-aloud protocol. Our analysis identified seven usability issues, and we subsequently addressed them in the optimization phase. Second, we evaluated the usability of the aging scenario Wiki as a learning tool in actual work teaching activities involving 54 students who collaborated on creating aging scenarios. The evaluation yields a System Usability Scale score of 67.45 and a C usability rating, indicating the areas for further improvement. Overall, the aging scenario Wiki demonstrated the potential to be a practical and effective learning tool for nascent Smart Eldercare education. Our study highlights the importance of user-centered design and usability testing in developing educational resources for emerging fields such as Smart Eldercare.

CP  - 4th International Conference onHuman Aspects of IT for the Aged Population (ITAP) held as Part of the 20th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI International)
KW  - Older adults

KW  - Need assessment
KW  - User-Centered Design
AB  - In this project, an online escape game for older adults was developed collaboratively with five novice developers and 12 older adults who tested the prototype game at several stages of the development process. We followed a User-Centered Design (UCD) process to develop the game. During the design process, older adults tested the game and it was refined based on their feedback and the research team's observation of their play. We found that incorporating older adults into the design process significantly improved the design, as they provided insights that would not have been available otherwise. We also concluded that the older adults' involvement in the design process could make the game better tailored to their needs. The game is currently being field-tested.

AB  - The study examines the cumulative impact of factors that affect usability testing for user-centered web design, namely the so-called 'contextual fidelity model' factors that include product properties, task features, user traits, and environment/context factors. Today, the design, user experience and usability (DUXU) research experiences a lack of studies that would assess combinatorial, rather than individual, effects of these factors upon user performance. We address this gap by seeing both independent factors and the resulting user states as complex and dynamic, and testing the combined impact of aesthetic quality of websites, user traits, and individual/group experiment settings upon formation of two dysfunctional user states that critically affect user performance, namely monotony and anxiety. We develop a research design that allows for assessing the combinatorial effects in formation of user dysfunctionality. For that, we conduct a study with 80 assessors of Russian/European and Chinese origin in individual/group setting, employing two types of tasks and websites of high/low aesthetic quality. As the results of our experiment show, group task solving enhances the synchronous impact of website aesthetics and task features upon user states. Interaction of high-quality design, group environment, and monotonous tasks provides for an antagonistic effect when aesthetic layout in a group environment significantly reduces the fatigue rate. Low aesthetic quality in a group environment leads to cumulative enhancing of dysfunctionality for both monotony and anxiety. We conclude by setting questions and prospects for further research.

AB  - Existing virtual reality (VR) street view and 360-degree road view applications often rely on complex controllers or touch interfaces, which can hinder user immersion and accessibility. These challenges are particularly pronounced for under-represented populations, such as older adults and individuals with limited familiarity with digital devices. Such groups frequently face physical or environmental constraints that restrict their ability to engage in outdoor activities, highlighting the need for alternative methods of experiencing the world through virtual environments. To address this issue, we propose a VR street view application featuring an intuitive, gesture-based interface designed to simplify user interaction and enhance accessibility for socially disadvantaged individuals. Our approach seeks to optimize digital accessibility by reducing barriers to entry, increasing user immersion, and facilitating a more inclusive virtual exploration experience. Through usability testing and iterative design, this study evaluates the effectiveness of gesture-based interactions in improving accessibility and engagement. The findings emphasize the importance of user-centered design in fostering an inclusive VR environment that accommodates diverse needs and abilities.

AB  - Technological innovation has increasingly become important in addressing the most pressing problems in society. To create better and sustainable solutions, project teams often strive to bring the people they are designed for to the innovation process. While the human-centered design approach has become popular in guiding design in the private sector, its place in addressing larger challenges beyond human needs is still not well defined. Using our experiences in designing the WasteWATER app, an open-source decision making tool intended to help design sustainable water reclamation systems, we illustrate the synergy between analytical research and human-centered design, through the convergence of design and anthropology in creating applied outcomes in universities. Analytical research can help understand complex problems such as the sustainability of water reclamation. At the same time, embedding design thinking in applied research projects can help researchers in academic institutions refine their solutions through collaborative and iterative design with stakeholders.

AB  - Software prototyping is a powerful method for the identification of usability problems at the very beginning of software development. This paper deals with the development of a prototype used for usability testing and presenting it to stakeholders at the correct time. A low-fidelity (lo-fi) prototype was created for a software product in the automotive industry, however the usability test was shifted to conduct it with the latest build of the software application. This paper emphasizes on the effectiveness of prototypes together with usability studies. It gives an overview about the experiences with usability testing on a high-fidelity (hi-fi) prototype late in the software development process. The main conclusion is that we assume that solving the usability findings of a hi-fi prototype is more difficult and expensive than using results from a lo-fi prototype earlier. In future, we will conduct a lo-fi prototype usability study to confirm this assumption.

AB  - There are a lot of growing e-Commerce companies in Indonesia with their own application that has been used by millions of users. One of the important informational channels in e-Commerce application is push notifications, of which its sole purpose is to push and deliver information to its users. The problem is that only a limited number of customers open push notifications immediately upon receiving. This research was conducted to find the key factors that determine user's desires to open push notification and to improve user's experiences when receiving push notifications. User-Centered Design and a mixed-method approach were used on this research, utilizing surveys and contextual interviews for data collection. Tokopedia is one of e-Commerce companies in Indonesia. Tokopedia iOS application is used in this research as a case study as Tokopedia is one of the most used e-Commerce application in Indonesia. The research findings show that the key determining factors are contents of the push notifications and time and frequency of receipt. Based on the results, a prototype has been designed in a high-fidelity form and was subsequently evaluated using the Usability Testing method. The evaluation show that the task success rate of said prototype is 88.3 percent, and accordingly it could be the solution to this problems.

AB  - Over the past two years the Usability Engineers at Attachmate Corporation have taken on new roles and responsibilities and have become involved earlier in the software development process. The opportunity to participate in the up-front design work, in addition to the more traditional usability evaluations, has been the driving force to mix and match pieces from existing usability methods. Many usability methods have been developed, and each method includes many techniques that can be used independent of the method. For this project, techniques were extracted from interview methods, task analysis methods, user-centered design methods, usability engineering methods, and usability testing methods. Usability was involved early enough in this software development project to impact the conceptual model for the product, the user interactions, and the user interface.

AB  - One of the more demanding aspects of formal evaluations in user-centered system design is the underlying requirement for an experimental platform that accurately reflects the functionality being tested and captures relevant user performance data. While we are unaware of any truly turn-key solutions for avoiding many of the inherent costs associated with the iterative cycle of user-centered system development and formal testing, in our mediated multitasking research, we have found that a multi-application host environment, instrumented for user tracking and a playback function for reviewing what individuals attended to, experienced, and did during the task-performance segments of interaction studies, could be implemented as a reusable infrastructure of services and control functions. In this short paper, we introduce the Testbed Framework System, a flexible and extensible software platform for use in the development and conduct of formal usability testing, and outline a number of its core functions and capabilities.

AB  - We describe an empirical, between-subjects study on the use of think-aloud protocols in usability testing of a federal data-dissemination Web site. This double-blind study used three different types of think-aloud protocols: a traditional protocol, a speech-communication protocol, and a coaching protocol. A silent condition served as the control. Eighty participants were recruited and randomly pre-assigned to one of four conditions. Accuracy and efficiency measures were collected, and participants rated their subjective satisfaction with the site. Results show that accuracy is significantly higher in the coaching condition than in the other conditions. The traditional protocol and the speech-communication protocol are not statistically different from each other with regard to accuracy. Participants in the coaching condition are more satisfied with the Web site than participants in the traditional or speech-communication condition. In addition, there are no significant differences with respect to efficiency (time-on-task). This paper concludes with recommendations for usability practitioners.

AB  - Usability testing on Ilmu (i.e. WebOPAC for children) showed that poor graphic design contributed the most to the usability problem. Three main issues of graphic design are layout, use of colors and human visual perception. A design approach is formulated in an effort to develop a conceptual design that specifies children's requirements and preferences on graphic issues. This involves two main activities which are identifying children's preferences on graphic design and generating design ideas using participatory design method. Four categories of requirements and preferences on graphic design are derived from children. Each category is demonstrated by design ideas. All these constitute towards the formulation of a conceptual design for children's WebOPAC interface and become the basis for redesigning Ilmu's interface.

AB  - Pre-medical students face the challenge of managing rigorous academic and extracurricular demands, which can lead to burnout. Effective tracking and visualization of their activities are crucial in keeping records of student progress. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a user-friendly dashboard tailored for pre-medical student data management. Semi-structured interviews with nine medical sciences baccalaureate program (MSBP) faculty members identified major issues in current data management practices, including standardization and tracking. Using affinity diagramming and Miroboard, five key themes emerged, guiding the creation of an initial dashboard prototype. After iterative critiques and revisions, the final design received positive feedback from the MSBP committee. Limitations include a small sample size and a lack of formal usability testing. Future work will focus on addressing implementation challenges and refining the design based on user feedback.

AB  - Introduction: Children are at increased risk of medication-associated adverse events, often due to weight-based dosing errors. We aimed to reduce the proportion of medications that were administered where the dosing weight was >= 10% different from the recorded weight. Methods: We adopted in-situ usability testing to iteratively improve design of clinical decision support that would enable accurate dosing weight documentation by prompting clinicians to update weight if recorded weight was > 10% different and it had been at least 7 days since the last dosing weight update. Results: The proportion of medication administrations with difference >10% between their recorded weight and dosing weight decreased from 13.1% (56,256/ 429,006) in the baseline period to 9.5% (35,560 / 372,443) in the intervention period (P < 0.001). Discussion and Conclusion: User-centered design of an interruptive alert improved the accuracy of dosing weights during medication administrations without substantial alert burden. In-situ usability testing is an effective approach to rapidly obtain feedback from frontline users and iterate on the design to effect desired behavior changes

To do this, we believe that designer-user interaction will function as the core action in discovering design requirements and validating the design problems and solutions by understanding users and their information in IS. With this view on designer-user interaction, we ask the following research question--what do interactions between designers and users characterize distinctive patterns in the design innovation process? As an empirical approach, this study analyzed thirty two digital innovation project narratives and synthesized four designer-user interaction patterns, which demonstrate nine sub-patterns. The significance of this study is to theorize the patterns of designer-user interaction and suggests a theoretical / practical guideline for researchers and practitioners in the community of the three innovation research communities.

AB  - The philosophy of discount usability engineering perfectly fits the health care setting, where cost-cutting is ubiquitously present. We adapted Nielsen's discount usability approach for the health care setting by combining traditional thinking aloud (n=18) and Card Sorting (n=18) with online prototyping (n=5) and simplified thinking aloud (n=5). We used the approach to design an efficient and effective website with infection control guidelines for nursing home staff leading to high levels of satisfaction within a time frame of three months for the total cost of (sic)7195. Based on our experiences, we would advocate using this discount user-centered approach for the design of e-health applications. Future research should concentrate on integrating the principles of creative co-design methods and online research into the discount usability approach.

AB  - People with vision impairments (VIP) are among the most vulnerable road users in traffic. Autonomous vehicles are believed to reduce accidents but still demand some form of external communication signaling relevant information to pedestrians. Recent research on the design of vehicle-pedestrian communication (VPC) focuses strongly on concepts for a non-disabled population. Our work presents an inclusive user-centered design for VPC, beneficial for both vision impaired and seeing pedestrians. We conducted a workshop with VIP (N=6), discussing current issues in road traffic and comparing communication concepts proposed by literature. A thematic analysis unveiled two important themes: number of communicating vehicles and content (affecting duration). Subsequently, we investigated these in a second user study in virtual reality (N=33, 8 VIP) comparing the VPC between groups of abilities. We found that trust and understanding is enhanced and cognitive load reduced when all relevant vehicles communicate; high content messages also reduce cognitive load.

AB  - Telehealth services in the State of Pernambuco, Brazil are led by the Telehealth Center (RedeNUTES) and based on HealthNet 2.0 software. Among the tele-assistance services, health professionals have clinical discussions focused on second opinions. This paper reports the experience in a PhD study through mixed-methods, to evaluate the telehealth services, planning and modeling a new tool to improve a telehealth system. We described the nurse's role in each phase of this study. The method of User-Centered Design was explored in three phases as Identification of work process, User's perception and collaborative modeling, Observational usability study. The main frame was based on collaborative techniques as Collaborative Prototype Design Process, cognitive walkthrough, and thinking-aloud. The users also identified all usability problems identified by the evaluators. The methods were useful in identifying usability problems, and easy to employ using standard equipment and software thus a relatively low cost approach to usability testing.

AB  - In this paper, we present a case study where we incorporate GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selectors) [2] task analysis into the design process of a visual analysis tool. We performed GOMS analysis on an Electroencephalography (EEG) analyst's current data analysis strategy to identify important user tasks and unnecessary user actions in his current workflow. We then designed an EEG data visual analysis tool based on the GOMS analysis result. Evaluation results show that the tool we have developed, EEGVis, allows the user to analyze EEG data with reduced subjective cognitive load, faster speed and increased confidence in the analysis quality. The positive evaluation results suggest that our design process demonstrates an effective application of GOMS analysis to discover opportunities for designing better tools to support the user's visual analysis process.

AB  - BMW i, as a sub-brand of the BMW Group, targets on delivering sustainable solutions for individual mobility. One of the most important steps on this path was the introduction of the all-electric BMW i3 in 2013. In order to design not only the vehicle in itself, but also especially the newly developed electric vehicle related functions for optimal customer experience, the HMI design process substantially relied on repeated usability testing and large international field trials. With more than 34 million test kilometers absolved during the MINI E and the BMW ActiveE field trials an extraordinary knowledge base about customer needs related to e-mobility contributed valuable input to the development of the user interface of the BMW i3 and HMI challenges beyond the vehicle like charging wallbox, smartphone app and web portal related to driving electric. The paper reports on the unique process of defining the user interface of the BMW Group's first purpose-designed electric vehicle including the nonvehicle- based e-mobility infrastructure components. Based on selected use cases, the interplay between evolutionary steps in the HMI and continued usability testing shows how user-centered design is applied for a completely new kind of vehicle, thus providing insights on the necessities of iterative testing for disruptive innovations.

AB  - This paper presents the Intrusion Detection toolkit (IDtk), an information Visualization tool for intrusion detection (ID). IDtk was developed through a user-centered design process, in which we idenfiTed design guidelines to support ID users. ID analysts protect their networks by searching for evidence of attacks in ID system output, Trewall and system logs, and other complex, textual data sources. Monitoring and analyzing these sources incurs a heavy cognitive load for analysts. The use of information visualization techniques offers a valuable addition to the toolkit of the ID analyst. Several visualization techniques for ID have been developed, but few usability or Teld studies have been completed to assess the needs of ID analysts and the usability and usefulness of these tools. We intended to Tll this gap by applying a user-centered design process in the development and evaluation of IDtk, a 3D, glyph-based visualization tool that gives the user maximum texibility in setting up how the visualization display represents ID data. The user can also customize whether the display is a simple, high-level overview to support monitoring, or a more complex 3D view allowing for viewing the data from multiple angles and thus supporting analysis and diagnosis. This texibility was found crucial in our usability evaluation. In addition to describing the tool, we report the Tndings of our user evaluation and propose new guidelines for the design of information visualization tools for ID.

AB  - In order to create user-centered design information to guide the development of personal health records (PHRs), 24 patients participated in usability assessments of VA's MyHealtheVet program. Observational videos and efficiency measures were collected among users performing four PHR scenarios: registration and log-in, prescription refill, tracking health, and searching for health information. Twenty-five percent of users successfully completed registration. Individuals preferred prescription numbers over names, sometimes due to privacy concerns. Only efficiency in prescription refills was significantly better than target values. Users wanted to print their information to share with their doctors, and questioned the value of MyHealtheVet search functions over existing online health information. In summary, PHR registration must balance simplicity and security, usability tests guide how PHRs can tailor functions to individual preferences, PHRs add value to users' data by making information more accessible and understandable, and healthcare organizations should build trust for PHR health content.

AB  - Many individuals who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing (DHH) in the U.S. have lower English language literacy levels than their hearing peers, which creates a barrier to access web content for these users. In the present study we determine a usable interface experience for authoring sentences (or multi-sentence messages) in ASL (American Sign Language) using the EMBR (Embodied Agents Behavior Realizer) animation platform. Three rounds of iterative designs were produced through participatory design techniques and usability testing, to refine the design, based on feedback from 8 participants familiar with creating ASL animations. Later, a usability testing session was conducted with four participants on the final iteration of the designs. We found that participants expressed a preference for a "timeline" layout for arranging words to create a sentence, with a dual view of the word-level and the sub-word "pose" level. This paper presents the details of the design stages of the new GUI, the results, and directions for future work.

AB  - With the development of technology, there are advances that help civilizations on their day-to-day activities, one of which is the implementation of e-Learning on the Final Exams. A standardized national computer- based final examination in Indonesia is called Ujian Nasional Berbasis Komputer ( UNBK). Despite the fact that UNBK has been held nationwide since 2016, its interface and system have only gone through minor improvement throughout the years. To improve the usability and interface of UNBK, it is necessary to first evaluate the current interface from the users. The user evaluation was conducted using a mixed-method approach to compare and/or relate qualitative data and quantitative data. The user evaluation using an online questionnaire with the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) shows that UNBK's quality only exceeds in System Quality with a score of 75.71 out of 100. The online questionnaire data is supported with the qualitative data of contextual interviews, resulting in an affinity diagram to observe users' needs, pain points, and missing opportunities. The improved interface design according to the users' feedbacks was also tested using Usability Testing. The result of the UT shows that it has the binary task succession rate of 86.50%.

AB  - Indonesia is the second largest food waste producer country in the world after Saudi Arabia. This condition is very worrying because food waste could impact on many aspects of people's life including food security, economy and environment. One of the approaches to solve this problem is to make mobile application to change human consumption behavior. It was also found that majority of interaction designs for sustainable food consumption practices are not yet fully using behavior change theory (BCT) as a basis design decision making so that it cannot be ascertained the resulting design intervention can influence user behavior. Fogg Behavior Model (FBM) Theory provides an explanation regarding what factors can be used to change human behavior. This project aims to apply FBM theory to the development of application interaction design for reducing household food waste with user-centered design (UCD) approach that has been adapted. Low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototyping are also used in solution design stage of UCD. Output from this project is high-fidelity prototype of Spoonful with usability goals effective to use, easy to learn, and user experience goals helpful. Each of goals are measured with usability testing using task completion rate, Single Ease Question (SEQ) and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) value/usefulness subscale. System Usability Scale (SUS) and self-evaluation of the theory of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) are also used for testing on overall usability and behavior change. The results show that the prototype is effective to use with success rate 94.3%, easy to learn with SEQ score 6.12 out of 7, helpful with IMI score for the value/usefulness subscale score of 6.59 out of 7, grade C acceptable with SUS score 74.58 out of 100 and help people to move to action stage from preparation stage with self-evaluation of TTM theory score 71.83 out of 80. FBM theory is very helpful and proven to provide better design justification for behavior change.

AB  - Frequently, project teams who participate actively in usability tests show more trust in the results, but they also tend to build up some frustration during the process of conducting the study itself. In multidisciplinary teams, user research methods and the skills required are not used by every team member on a daily basis. Therefore, the felt ownership mostly lies within the roles of user researcher and/or interaction designer, who guide the teams through the process. SAP's central user research team wanted to enhance method literacy and empathic involvement in multidisciplinary teams. Therefore, we have introduced an emotional component into the process through applying slight modifications to user research methods by using game mechanics. In this paper, we want to describe the application of game mechanics to the method 'usability test' as an example for this approach. We elaborate on the prerequisites and considerations that led to the approach, describe the game that has been created and the experiences we made so far.

AB  - Authoring and editing access control policy can be a complex and cognitive demanding task, especially when dealing with a large number of rules and attributes. Visualisation techniques are known to be helpful to users analysing intricate data, and can, in some contexts, help decreasing the cognitive load. In this paper, we propose a new tool, VisABAC, which enables the visualisation of attribute based access control policies using the Circle Packing method. We used a participatory design, following a survey of existing visualisation methods in access control. VisABAC is designed as a web-page component, developed in Javascript using the D3.js library, and as such is easily usable without requiring any particular setup. In addition to presenting VisABAC, we demonstrate its usability by conducting a controlled experiment with 32 participants, asking them to change some attribute values in order to obtain a given decision for a policy, and measuring the time taken by participants to conduct these tasks (the faster, the better). We show a small to medium effect size (d = 0.44), thus indicating that VisABAC is a promising tool for authoring and editing access control policies.

KW  - PERFORMANCE
AB  - This study aimed to apply gesture-based cognition learning technology to develop an educational training support system (G-NETS) for physical assessment practicum. The processes of G-NETS system development can be divided into two stages: user-centered design (UCD) development and system verification. Eventually, the quantitative and qualitative analysis is conducted to evaluate nursing students learning performance, attitude, cognitive load, and technology acceptance. Results reveal that G-NETS can help the clinical nursing instructors to access the learners' information easily, to monitor the student's learning behavior in clinical courses, and to give them timely support and feed-backs accordingly. That in turn can reduce the percentage of mistakes and increase the quality of clinical practicum learning process. In the future, this study can be applied to clinical education, the training of new clinical nursing staff, other subjects of clinical practicum training, which expand the beneficial results of practical training and clinical teaching.

AB  - Software development methods have been evolved to enable producing usable systems rapidly while considering all requirements. Several studies have focused on the need to balance between rapid development and capturing requirements related to user experience and business workflow. This balance has become more urging during COVID19 because many businesses want to quickly transfer to usable electronic systems that are accurate, efficient, easy to learn, satisfy users and support remote work. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework by integrating Rapid Application Development (RAD) method with Participatory Design (PD) method for enabling rapid production of usable systems. Both RAD and PD consist of design stages that can overlap and generate new phases where users participate in the design process and accelerate the production. Five usability tests are also added to the framework to validate the usability of the design at all stages. The Action Research method is used to assess the framework empirically in a context of an urgent need to an electronic system, and qualitative data analyses were conducted. The results show that the framework can be adopted by software companies because it satisfies the requirements of adopting software development methods. Also, the system developed using the framework is usable. The paper concludes that COVID19 affects software development by emphasizing rapid development while maintaining workflow. Also, using video conference for remote design assists in meeting users more frequently and in creating concise requirement documentation.

AB  - Objective: Medication reconciliation (MedRec) can improve patient safety by resolving medication discrepancies. Because information technology (IT) and patient engagement are promising approaches to optimizing MedRec, the SEAMPAT project aims to develop a MedRec IT platform based on two applications: the "patient app" and the "MedRec app." This study evaluates three dimensions of the usability (efficiency, satisfaction, and effectiveness) and usefulness of the patient app.
   Methods: We performed a four-month user-centered observational study. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Participants completed the system usability scale (SUS) questionnaire and a second questionnaire on usefulness. Effectiveness was assessed by measuring the completeness of the medication list generated by the patient application and its correctness (ie medication discrepancies between the patient list and the best possible medication history). Qualitative data were collected from semi-structured interviews, observations and comments, and questions raised by patients.
   Results: Forty-two patients completed the study. Sixty-nine percent of patients considered the patient app to be acceptable (SUS Score >= 70) and usefulness was high. The medication list was complete for a quarter of the patients (7/28) and there was a discrepancy for 21.7% of medications (21/97). The qualitative data enabled the identification of several barriers (related to functional and non-functional aspects) to the optimization of usability and usefulness.
   Conclusions: Our findings highlight the importance and value of user-centered usability testing of a patient application implemented in "real-world" conditions. To achieve adoption and sustained use by patients, the app should meet patients' needs while also efficiently improving the quality of MedRec.

AB  - Objectives: As patient care becomes more collaborative in nature, there is a need for information technology that supports interdisciplinary practices of care. This study developed and performed usability testing of a standalone computer-based information tool to support the interdisciplinary practice of palliative severe pain management (SPM).
   Design: A grounded theory-participatory design (GT-PD) approach was used with three distinct palliative data sources to obtain and understand user requirements for SPM practice and how a computer-based information tool could be designed to support those requirements.
   Results: The GT-PD concepts and categories provided a rich perspective of palliative SPM and the process and information support required for different SPM tasks. A conceptual framework consisting of an ontology and a set of three problem-solving methods was developed to reconcile the requirements of different interdisciplinary team members. The conceptual framework was then implemented as a prototype computer-based information tool that has different modes of use to support both day-to-day case management and education of palliative SPM. Usability testing of the computer tool was performed, and the tool tested favorably in a laboratory setting.
   Conclusion: An interdisciplinary computer-based information tool can be developed to support the different work practices and information needs of interdisciplinary team members, but explicit requirements must be sought from all prospective users of such a tool. Qualitative methods such as the hybrid GT-PD approach used in this research are particularly helpful for articulating computer tool design requirements.

AB  - Multi-step retrosynthetic route planning (MRRP) is the core task in synthetic chemistry, in which chemists recursively deconstruct a target molecule to find a set of reactants that make up the target. MRRP is challenging in that the search space is vast, and chemists are often lost in the process. Existing AI models can achieve automatic MRRP fast, but they only work on relatively simple targets, which leaves complex molecules under chemists' expertise. To facilitate MRRP of complex molecules, we proposed a human-AI collaborative system, RetroLens, through a participatory design process. AI can contribute by two approaches: joint action and algorithm-in-the-loop. Deconstruction steps are allocated to chemists or AI based on their capabilities and AI recommends candidate revision steps to fix problems along the way. A within-subjects study (N=18) showed that chemists who used RetroLens reported faster MRRP, broader design space exploration, higher confidence in their planning, and lower cognitive load.

AB  - In this study, we conducted a computer-based experiment to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of six different interface designs, graphical or list-based, in supporting communication of an object's "relevance" from an information retrieval (IR) system to its users. We adopted the Model Human Processor to provide a necessary framework to incorporate relevant cognitive psychology theories and user-centered design principles in the development of different interfaces. The study had a well-researched theoretical foundation, complied with relevant design principles, and included a large-scale empirical evaluation, Our results suggest that interface design may have a significant effect on system-user concept communication, regardless of users' familiarity with the search task, and that a graphical user interface may be more effective in supporting such communication than a list-based design. Furthermore, we also examined the cognitive load and user satisfaction resulting from each investigated interface design. Findings of the study have important implications for the design of IR systems (including online library systems and Internet-based search systems) as well as for the information representation and visualization of knowledge management systems, which ordinarily depend on text-based display methods to support system-user concept communication.

AB  - Kinaesthetic creativity refers to the body's ability to generate alternate futures in activities such as role-playing in participatory design workshops. This has relevance not only to the design of methods for inspiring creativity but also to the design of systems that promote engaging experiences via bodily interaction. This paper probes this creative process by studying how dancers interact with technology to generate ideas. We developed a series of parameterized interactive visuals and asked dance practitioners to use them in generating movement materials. From our study, we define a taxonomy that comprises different relationships and movement responses dancers form with the visuals. Against this taxonomy, we describe six types of interaction patterns and demonstrate how dance creativity is driven by the ability to shift between these patterns. We then propose a set of interaction design qualities to support kinaesthetic creativity.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to provide a qualitative analysis of the end result of the design and implementation process of a vehicle pooling platform. It analyzes Creativity vs Knowledge interaction patterns in the innovation process under the four different perspectives proposed in the theoretical framework of the CKI model (Palmieri and Giglio, 2013; Palmieri and Giglio, 2014). It aims to identify determining factors and impacts of the technology platform at urban, regional or national level. This application of the CKI model is geared to prove how its comprehensive slant supports the design, monitoring and assessment of innovation plans.
   Design/methodology/approach - This work is based on a case study approach and on a qualitative research involving literature review activities. Its design is compliant with the theoretical framework of the CKI model in order to identify the aforementioned four perspectives and capture the outcomes of the innovation process for all possible stakeholders. It utilizes a mixed methodology consisting of a panel of experts, geared to perform a qualitative assessment of the magnitude of impacts of the entrepreneurial initiative, and the participation observation methodology, for a complementary analysis of interaction patterns throughout the process.
   Originality/value - The study proposes a very recent theoretical framework to analyze entrepreneurial initiatives with a broader perspective than the prevailing one in literature. Applying the CKI model to the case study at hand proves how deep can be the impacts of a start-up initiative and helps deepening the impacts of Creativity vs Knowledge interaction patterns at the initial stage of the innovation process. Moreover, it provides a hitherto unexplored methodological approach consisting of a complementary analysis of interaction patterns in innovation processes by mixing the participation observation and the panel of experts methodologies.
   Practical implications - The end result of this study shows the real-world impacts of such a research project focusing on the value creation for different stakeholders and the community as a whole. It deepens also how Creativity vs Knowledge dynamics play as determinants and affect the end result of the innovation process. This work includes also a methodology tool for scholars since it is endowed with two complementary approaches - i.e. participation observation and panel of experts. Finally, this paper provides scholars with the first guide about the application of the CKI in order to conduct similar studies in other contexts.

AB  - Background: General practitioners play a unique key role in diagnosing patients with unclear diseases. Decision support systems in primary care can assist with diagnosis provided that they are efficient and user-friendly. Objectives: The objective of this study is to develop a high-fidelity prototype of the user interface of a clinical decision support system for primary care, particularly for diagnosis support in unclear diseases, using expert inspections at an early stage of development to ensure a high level of usability. Methods: The user interface prototype was iteratively developed based on previous research, design principles, and usability guidelines. During the development phase, three usability inspections were carried out by all experts at four-week intervals as heuristic walkthrough. Each inspection consisted of two parts: 1) Task-based inspection 2) Free exploration and evaluation based on usability heuristics. Five domain experts assessed the current status of development. The tasks in the inspections were based on the task model derived in the requirements analysis: perform data entry, review and discuss results, schedule further diagnostics, refer to specialists and close case. Results: As a result of this iterative development, a high-fidelity, clickable user interface prototype was created that is able to fulfil all six tasks of our task model. The usability inspections identified a total of 196 usability issues (for all 3 inspections; Part 1: 90 issues, Part 2: 106 issues), ranging in severity from minor to severe. These served the continuous adjustment and improvement of the prototype. All main tasks were completed successfully despite these problems. Conclusion: Usability inspections through heuristic walkthroughs can support and optimise the development of a user-centred decision support system in order to ensure its suitability for performing relevant tasks.

AB  - Background: Most mHealth app users rely on an app's rankings, star ratings, or reviews, which may not reflect users' individual healthcare needs. To help healthcare providers, researchers, and users select an optimal mHealth app, the Method of App Selection based on User Needs (MASUN) 1.0(1) was developed and tested in prior research. Initial testing found the need for improvement.
   Objective: This multiple-phase study aimed to simplify and improve MASUN 1.0, resulting in MASUN 2.0, and verify the feasibility and usability of MASUN 2.0.
   Methods: This study was conducted in three phases: (1) modification of MASUN 1.0 to improve its importance, applicability, relevance, and clarity, in consultation with 21 experts in medical or nursing informatics; (2) validation of the draft MASUN 2.0, with 13 experts; and (3) feasibility testing of MASUN 2.0 and usability evaluation of the best app found through MASUN 2.0. Menstrual apps were used to test the framework.
   Results: From Phases 1 and 2, MASUN 2.0, the framework for mHealth App selection, was derived with improved simplicity, usability, and applicability through a reduced number of tasks and time required. In Phase 3, after screening and scoring 2377 menstrual apps, five candidate apps were selected and evaluated by five clinical experts, five app experts, and five potential users. Finally, 194 users evaluated the usability of the app selected as the best. The best app helped users understand their health-related syndromes and patterns. Additionally, userprovided scores for impact, usefulness, and ease of use for the app were higher than for others.
   Conclusions: This study successfully modified MASUN 1.0 into MASUN 2.0 and verified MASUN 2.0 through content validity, feasibility, and usability testing. The selected apps through MASUN 2.0 helped health consumers more easily address health discomfort. Future research should extend this work to an automated system and different medical conditions with multiple stakeholders for digital health equity.

AB  - Objective: To design and evaluate an interactive data quality (DQ) characterization tool focused on fitness-for-use completeness measures to support researchers' assessment of a dataset.
   Materials and Methods: Design requirements were identified through a conceptual framework on DQ, literature review, and interviews. The prototype of the tool was developed based on the requirements gathered and was further refined by domain experts. The Fitness-for-Use Tool was evaluated through a within-subjects controlled experiment comparing it with a baseline tool that provides information on missing data based on intrinsic DQ measures. The tools were evaluated on task performance and perceived usability.
   Results: The Fitness-for-Use Tool allows users to define data completeness by customizing the measures and its thresholds to fit their research task and provides a data summary based on the customized definition. Using the Fitness-for-Use Tool, study participants were able to accurately complete fitness-for-use assessment in less time than when using the Intrinsic DQ Tool. The study participants perceived that the Fitness-for-Use Tool was more useful in determining the fitness-for-use of a dataset than the Intrinsic DQ Tool.
   Discussion: Incorporating fitness-for-use measures in a DQ characterization tool could provide data summary that meets researchers needs. The design features identified in this study has potential to be applied to other biomedical data types.
   Conclusion: A tool that summarizes a dataset in terms of fitness-for-use dimensions and measures specific to a research question supports dataset assessment better than a tool that only presents information on intrinsic DQ measures.

AB  - Background: Guidelines recommend reluctant psychotropic drug (PD) prescribing in nursing home residents with dementia and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), as efficacy of PDs is limited, and side effects are common. Nevertheless, PDs are commonly prescribed to reduce NPS. A smartphone application that evaluates appropriateness of PD prescriptions and provides recommendations from the revised Dutch guideline on problem behaviour in dementia may promote guideline adherence and increase appropriate prescribing.Objective: This study aimed to assess user experiences, barriers and facilitators of the Dutch 'Psychotropic Drug Tool' smartphone application (PDT) in the context of appropriate prescribing of PDs to nursing home residents with dementia and NPS.Methods/design: The PDT was developed according to the recommendations of the Dutch guideline for treatment of NPS in people with dementia. Feedback provided during usability testing with two end-users was applied to improve the PDT before implementation in day-to-day practice. Sixty-three prescribers were asked to use the PDT at their own convenience for four months. User expectations and experiences were assessed at baseline and after four months with the System Usability Scale and the Assessment of Barriers and Facilitators for Implementation.Results: Expected usability (M = 72.59; SD = 11.84) was similar to experienced usability after four months (M = 69.13; SD = 16.48). Appreciation of the PDTs user-friendliness (on average 6.7 out of 10) and design (7.3) were moderately positive, in contrast to the global rating of the PDT (5.7). Perceived barriers for PDT use were time consumption and lack of integration with existing electronic systems. Perceived facilitators were ease of use and attractive lay out. For broader implementation, physicians suggested a change in direction of the PDT: start assessment of appropriateness based on the list of NPS instead of PD as primary input.Conclusions: In this pragmatic prospective cohort study we found that the PDT was used by elderly care physicians, with mediocre user satisfaction. The PDT will be optimized based on user feedback regarding experienced usability, barriers and facilitators, after which broader implementation can be initialized. The Medical Ethics Review Board of the University Medical Center Groningen declared this is a non-WMO study (UMCG RR Number: 201800284).

AB  - Objective Most electronic health records display historical medication information only in a data table or clinician notes. We designed a medication timeline visualization intended to improve ease of use, speed, and accuracy in the ambulatory care of chronic disease.
   Materials and Methods We identified information needs for understanding a patient medication history, then applied human factors and interaction design principles to support that process. After research and analysis of existing medication lists and timelines to guide initial requirements, we hosted design workshops with multidisciplinary stakeholders to expand on our initial concepts. Subsequent core team meetings used an iterative user-centered design approach to refine our prototype. Finally, a small pilot evaluation of the design was conducted with practicing physicians.
   Results We propose an open-source online prototype that incorporates user feedback from initial design workshops, and broad multidisciplinary audience feedback. We describe the applicable design principles associated with each of the prototype's key features. A pilot evaluation of the design showed improved physician performance in 5 common medication-related tasks, compared to tabular presentation of the same information.
   Discussion There is industry interest in developing medication timelines based on the example prototype concepts. An open, standards-based technology platform could enable developers to create a medication timeline that could be deployable across any compatible health IT application.
   Conclusion The design goal was to improve physician understanding of a patient's complex medication history, using a medication timeline visualization. Such a design could reduce temporal and cognitive load on physicians for improved and safer care.

AB  - Objective Lung transplant (LTx) saves lives in cystic fibrosis (CF). However, many potential candidates express uncertainty about LTx and die before receiving this treatment. CF guidelines recommend LTx education and clinical discussions well before the need for LTx arises, but limited patient resources exist. Materials and Methods We engaged people with CF and CF physicians in human-centered design of "Take On Transplant" (TOT), a web-based education tool to prepare patients for LTx discussions. Across 3 phases, needs assessment, design groups, and iterative user testing of TOT, we refined TOT from wireframe prototypes, to an interactive website, to a fully functional intervention ready for clinical trials. Results Fifty-five people with CF and 105 physicians identified information needs to prepare for LTx discussions. Design groups (n = 14 participants) then established core requirements: didactic education ("Resource Library"), patient narratives ("CF Stories"), frequently asked questions ("FAQ"), and self-assessment to tailor content ("My CF Stage"). Iterative usability testing (n = 39) optimized the design of CF Stories and prototype layout. We then developed the TOT website and demonstrated feasibility and preliminary efficacy of use through 2-week field testing (n = 9). Discussion Our human-centered design process provided guidance for educational tools to serve the evolving needs of potential LTx candidates. Our findings support the process of patient deliberation as a foundation for shared decision-making in CF, and inform educational tools that could potentially translate beyond LTx. Conclusion TOT fills a critical gap in preparing people with CF for shared decision-making about LTx and may serve as a model for educational tools for other preference-sensitive decisions.

AB  - Massively Multiplayer Online Role-playing Games (MMORPGs) feature a large number of players socially interacting with one another in an immersive gaming environment. A successful MMORPG should engage players and meet their needs to achieve different cate-gories of gratifications. Research on the evolution of player social interaction network and the dynamics of inter-player intimacy could provide insights into players' gratification-oriented behaviors in MMORPGs. Such understanding could in turn guide game designs for better engaging existing players and marketing strategies for attracting newcomers. Conventional dynamic network analysis may help investigate game-based social interactions at the macroscopic level. However, current dynamic network visualization techniques mainly focus on illustrating topological changes of the entire network, which are unsuitable for analyzing player-specific social interactions in the virtual world from an egocentric perspective. In general, game designers and operators find it difficult to analyze the way players with different gratification needs may interact with one another and the consequences on their relationships with direct ties, using a decentralized social graph with complicated time-varying structures. In this paper, we present MMOSeer, a visual analytics system for exploring the evolution of egocentric player intimacy network. MMOSeer focuses on the relationship between a player (ego) and his/her directly-linked friends (alters). We follow a user-centered design process to develop the system with game analysts and apply novel visualization techniques in conjunction with well-established algorithms to depict the evolution of intimacy egocentric network. We also derive a centrality change metric to infer how the impact of changes in an ego's interactive behaviors may propagate through the intimacy network, reshaping the structure of the alters' social circles at both micro and macro levels. Finally, we validate the usability of MMOSeer by discovering different user interaction patterns and the corresponding ego-network structural changes in a real-world gameplay dataset from a commercial MMORPG.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an overwhelming strain on our Nations ability to treat patients; the number of patients who need to be tested continues to rise. With nurses also becoming infected, the number of trained professionals who can perform tasks such as testing of patients along with providing care involving hooking up patients to ventilators continues to decrease as well. There is a need to explore the adoption of virtual computer-based training mediums which will enable new nurses and others to be trained in safe and efficient procedures involving patients during this pandemic period. In this paper, the design of a VR-based simulator based on Human-Centered Computing (HCC) principles are discussed. The role of HCC factors such as affordance and cognitive load on the comprehension and scene understanding of nurses during training and the acquisition of knowledge of safety procedures and detailed steps (pertaining to nasal sample collection and use of ventilators on patients) has been studied with the involvement of nurse and nurse trainee participants. Adoption of a participatory design approach involving experts (nurses, doctors involved in covid-19 testing and treatment) has provided a foundational basis for the design of the training environments and assessment activities. Formal information-centric process models of the nasal swabbing procedures and ventilator hookup tasks were created using the engineering Enterprise Modeling Language (eEML). The preliminary results from the assessment activities indicate the positive impact of such HCC based 3D simulators in such training of first responders.

AB  - Background: "The graying of the globe" has resulted in exponential rise in health care expenses, over-worked health care professionals and a growing patient base suffering from multiple chronic diseases, one of which is diabetes. Consumer health technologies (CHT) are considered important catalysts for empowering health care consumers to take a proactive role in managing their health and related costs. Adoption rate and usability of such devices among the aging is far from being satisfactory. Past studies noted the motivation for adoption by the aging is dependent on the suitability/relevance, perceived usability and anticipated benefits associated with usage of technological innovation. Traditional information technology (IT) development adopts a systematic approach without necessarily using a specific user model that personalizes the system to the aging user groups. The aging patient population has unique needs arising from progressive deterioration in both physiological and psychological abilities. These needs are often ignored in the design, development, trial and adoption of consumer health products resulting in low adoption and usage.
   Objectives: The main objective of this research is to investigate the user-centered design (UCD), specifically user profiles and personas, as methodological tools to inform the design and development of CHT devices for an aging population. The adoption of user profile and persona has not received much attention in health care informatics research and, in particular, research involving CHT. Our work begins to fill this void in three ways. We (1) illuminate the process of developing CHT user profiles and personas for a Chinese elder population with a demanding health care needs, i.e., self-management of chronic diabetes, with the hope that the resulting profiles and personas may be used as foundational material for informing the design, development and evaluation of CHT in other similar contexts; (2) call attention to how to further enhance and complement traditional user profile and persona techniques for CHT design by integrating cognitive structures and present behavior that drive health care thinking, future behavior and demand; (3) show how the profiles and personas can be used to inform requirements, design and implementation decisions for a technology aimed at facilitating CHT adoption and diffusion for the elderly.
   Methodology: To exemplify process and application, we use an action-research methodology, where user profiles and personas of an aging patient population were developed. The resultant profiles and personas were leveraged to improve the design, development and implementation plans of a smart phone application to assist chronically ill aging Chinese diabetic population capable of disease self-management.
   Results: The results from the study show that user profile and persona can be a valuable methodological approach in capturing the conceptual model of the aging and informing the design and development decisions of CHT. The demonstration of techniques used in this study can serve as a guideline to CHT developers in bringing conceptual user modeling into the design of software interfaces targeted for users with specific health care needs. Specifically, the study provides guidance on the creation and use of profiles and personas to tap into the conceptual models of the targeted elderly population reflecting their preferences, capabilities and attitudes towards using technology in self-management care in general and the smart phone diabetes management application in particular. Insight into the mental model of the aging group has been shown to inform later stages of UCD development (e.g., the creation of prototypes and usability testing) as well as implementation and adoption strategies. The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that by 2025, 80% of all new cases of diabetes are expected to appear in the developing countries. In fact, the number of diabetic patients in China is estimated to rise to 42.3 million in 2030 from 20.8 million in 2000. Thus, we investigate the Chinese aging population in order to demonstrate the process of developing and using user profile and persona. We hope that the resultant conceptual model of the Chinese aging diabetic population can be used in future research to guide CHT designers interested in designing health care devices for this vulnerable user group.
