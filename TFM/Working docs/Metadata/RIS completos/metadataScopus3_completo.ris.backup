AB  - Autobiographical writings are invaluable for research, offering relevant insights into personal experiences and cultural contexts. This is particularly true for Italian actresses, whose autobiographies, while rich with information, have been relatively underexplored in academic research. The Women Writing around the Camera (WOW) project addresses this gap by developing a semantic portal dedicated to these autobiographical texts. The WOW portal will reveal the dynamics between the actresses' writings, their private lives, their artistic careers, and the cultivation of the diva image. As a first step towards this goal, this paper presents the WOW knowledge graph (KG), which maps the personal and professional networks related to the divas' lives. The KG was built starting from the actresses' autobiographies, guided by a taxonomy of themes curated by domain experts. Although still under development and expansion, the KG provides a solid foundation for future enhancements. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Underwater cultural heritage sites represent an attractive and exciting experience for diving tourists, even if often it is complicated for them to understand the significance and value of the remains that are usually strongly damaged and covered by the marine organisms. Thanks to the recent advancements in technologies that overcome these problems, augmented reality is nowadays possible even in such harsh conditions, opening new possibilities for enhancing the diver's experience. However, no user study has formally evaluated the usefulness and usability of augmented reality in open sea underwater environments. This paper presents two novel solutions for underwater augmented reality: a compact marker-based system for small areas, and a complex acoustic system for large areas. Both of them were deployed at an underwater cultural heritage site and evaluated by ten divers in experiments analyzing their perception and remembrance, interests, and user experience. For comparison, the same study was also performed with non-divers assessing the marker-based system on land. Results show that both systems allow divers to encounter new and exciting moments and provide valuable insights for underwater augmented reality applications.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Automatic storytelling is a broad challenge in research contexts such as Natural Language Processing and Contend Based Image Analysis. Despite the considerable achievements of machine learning techniques in these research fields, combining different approaches to fill the gap between an automatic generated story and human handwriting is hard. This work proposes a novel storytelling framework in the Cultural Heritage domain. We developed our framework based on a Multimedia Knowledge Graph (MKG), a crucial point of our work. Furthermore, we populated our Multimedia Knowledge Graph with a focused crawler that employs deep learning techniques to recognise a multimedia object from web resources. Furthermore, we used a combined approach of deep learning techniques and Linked Open Data (LOD) to retrieve information about images and depicted figures using Instance Segmentation. The system has a dynamic, user-friendly interface that guides the user during the storytelling process. Finally, we evaluated the system from a qualitative and quantitative point of view. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Collaborative data collection initiatives are increasingly becoming pivotal to cultural institutions and scholars, to boost the population of born-digital archives. For over a decade, organisations have been leveraging Semantic Web technologies to design their workflows, ensure data quality, and a means for sharing and reusing (Linked Data). Crucially, scholarly projects that leverage cultural heritage data to collaboratively develop new resources would benefit from agile solutions to simplify the Linked Data production workflow via user-friendly interfaces. To date, only a few pioneers have abandoned legacy cataloguing and archiving systems to fully embrace the Linked Open Data (LOD) paradigm and manage their catalogues or research products through LOD-native management systems. In this article we present Crowdsourcing Linked Entities via web Form (CLEF), an agile LOD-native platform for collaborative data collection, peer-review, and publication. We detail design choices as motivated by two case studies, from the Cultural Heritage and scholarly domains respectively, and we discuss benefits of our solution in the light of prior works. In particular, the strong focus on user-friendly interfaces for producing FAIR data, the provenance-aware editorial process, and the integration with consolidated data management workflows, distinguish CLEF as a novel attempt to develop Linked Data platforms for cultural heritage.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The paper introduces the Cultural Leaf Semantic Portal whose aim is to provide a consolidated user-friendly solution for exploring the 36,132 Romanian artifacts and the 1,086 cultural entities that house them. Using the eCHO framework, the data collected from official sources are subjected to a transformation process through which they are sanitized, temporal expressions are normalized, thus reducing the number of forms in which the centuries and millennia are expressed from 1,733 to only 67, and then they are transformed into semantic structures. Finally, the resulting data is accessible via both a SPARQL endpoint and a semantic portal. © 2024, Politechnica University of Bucharest. All rights reserved.

AB  - By integrating heritage, design, and technology, "Alive Yi"innovatively empowers intangible cultural heritage through interactive generative design. Using our extensive pattern database, we visualize traditional Yi minority embroidery by applying particle and 3D effects in TouchDesigner with Leap Motion, emphasizing their symbolic meanings. This interactivity allows users to transform heritage visuals in real-time, fostering deeper engagement and appreciation. Future plans include using AI tools to create designs appealing to youth. Despite technical challenges, this approach promises cultural resilience in the digital age, offering a blueprint for leveraging computational creativity to preserve and sustain intangible culture.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Nieuwe Instituut (NI) houses the Dutch National Collection of Architecture and Urban Planning.This collection consists of about 4 million objects, including design drawings, 3D models, and photographs.As part of the program Disclosing Architecture, which is now in its sixth and final year, the Linked Open Data (LOD) project aims to share the richness of data within the collection with the public through semantic web technologies.This project will ultimately facilitate the exchange of cultural heritage data with related national and international institutions.Currently, Nieuwe Instituut (NI)'s collection management system contains inconsistent records due to changes in registration guidelines and the migration from older collection management tools.Without documentation of these guidelines, it is impossible to establish consistent rules for the entire dataset.Yet, clean data is crucial for effectively showcasing NI's collection to the public.In response, this paper introduces a framework for higher-quality LOD data, the Data Cleaning Initiative (DCI).The first implementation of the DCI is through a series of steps planned for the year 2024 with the goal of cleaning and enriching the collection data at NI. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Historic cemeteries face ravages of time, weather, and vandalism. We first captured hundreds of images for each of several unindexed historic cemeteries. We then used a high performance computing system to orthorectify these images into ultraresolution (billions of pixels), georeferenced, tiled images. Here, we describe the interactive visualization we developed using these tiled images to enable volunteers to collaboratively map graves and identify burials. Our ongoing work tests the capacity of this visualization to enable coordination between volunteers with distinct and often asynchronous assignments, including photography, mapping, research, and restoration.  © 2023 ACM.

AB  - Web resources in linked open data (LOD) are comprehensible to humans through literal textual values attached to them, such as labels, notes, or comments. Word choices in literals may not always be neutral. When culturally stereotyping terminology is used in literals, they may appear as offensive to users in interfaces and propagate stereotypes to algorithms trained on them. We study how frequently and in which literals contentious terms about people and cultures occur in LOD and whether there are attempts to mark the usage of such terms. For our analysis, we reuse English and Dutch terms from a knowledge graph that provides opinions of experts from the cultural heritage domain about terms' contentiousness. We inspect occurrences of these terms in four widely used datasets: Wikidata, The Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus, Princeton WordNet, and Open Dutch WordNet. Some terms are ambiguous and contentious only in particular senses. Applying word sense disambiguation, we generate a set of literals relevant to our analysis. We found that contentious terms frequently appear in descriptive and labelling literals, such as preferred labels that are usually displayed in interfaces and used for indexing. In some cases, LOD contributors mark contentious terms with words and phrases in literals (implicit markers) or properties linked to resources (explicit markers). However, such marking is rare and non-consistent in all datasets. Our quantitative and qualitative insights could be helpful in developing more systematic approaches to address the propagation of stereotypes via LOD. © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - Many museums are interested in addressing the presence of problematic terminology in their catalogue data but are uncertain of what they should look for and what do to when a problematic term is encountered. There is an opportunity to address the lack of guidance and scarcity of resources available for museums looking to engage with this work through the use of linked open data in order to create a knowledge graph that links together machine-readable versions of terminology guidance from multiple sources and then further connects them to additional lexicographical resources. The resulting knowledge graph can then be leveraged to support critical cataloguing tasks—namely confirming a term as problematic in a given context and making a decision of how to proceed—by providing cataloguers with the information they need to perform their work. This approach seeks to meet the needs of museum professionals to have access to domain best practice while allowing for localization of recommendations. This research seeks to understand what kinds of language museums are concerned with, how museums are thinking about what makes a term problematic, what possible reparative actions museums feel are appropriate given different contexts, and what kinds of information museum professionals look for to make a decision about which action to take. This work is taking place as part of a Collaborative Doctoral Partnership studentship co-supervised by the University of Oxford and the Victoria and Albert Museum, and as such the Victoria and Albert Museum serves as the case study for the exploration of this research area. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Folklore culture is the summary and embodiment of a way of life, a normative form for people, covering local life in rural communities. A folklore museum typically displays historical objects used as part of people’s everyday lives. The representation of information in the digital realm is an important aspect of cultural heritage institutions, with museums taking over a considerable proportion. Having taken into consideration requirements set by the existing literature and examining relevant research and approaches, the authors developed an analysis framework including 16 popular folklore museums around the world, in order to examine various aspects of their digital presence. More specifically, the authors followed a two-fold methodological approach conducting a functionality and semantic analysis of the chosen museums with the purpose of determining the current approaches and tendencies with respect to representation schemata for folklore museum artifacts and their digital representation.

AB  - This paper examines the role of Digital Humanities (DH) in the preservation, restoration, and valorization of cultural heritage through the case study of the Sanctuary of Madonna di Carufo, a site heavily damaged during the Central Italy earthquakes of 2016. By integrating advanced archival methodologies, international standards, and digital tools such as Omeka S and CollectiveAccess, the project seeks to create a multi-typological digital archive that preserves historical, technical, and educational resources. The research investigates the employment of interoperable metadata standards like ISAD(G), Dublin Core, and RiC to ensure accessibility, sustainability, and long-term usability. The study highlights the potential of digital archives not only as repositories of data but as interconnected hubs of knowledge, fostering new interdisciplinary research opportunities and global cultural exchange. © 2025 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The proliferation of data on the Web has resulted in an increased need for effective techniques to extract relevant and valuable knowledge from this data. The intersection of the fields of Information Extraction and Semantic Web has created new opportunities to improve ontology-based information extraction tools. However, the development and evaluation of such systems have been hampered by the scarcity of annotated documents, particularly in historical domains. This article discusses the current state of our work in creating a large RDF dataset that aims to support the development of ontology-based extraction tools. The dataset was created through manual annotation by domain experts as part of the arkivo project and contains approximately 300,000 triples, which are freely available. This dataset can be used as a benchmark to evaluate systems that automatically extract entities and annotate documents. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - There are several ways to publish data on the web, from plain or GitHub web pages, to linked open data, and online catalogs. However, since each data owner can select a different way to publish his data, it is challenging to discover all the available datasets that are represented through a particular ontology O. The rationale for building a catalog for datasets expressed with respect to a particular ontology O (or specializations of O), is that the community which is interested in that ontology has various incentives to publish its datasets in such a catalog: for inspecting the use of the ontology (for spotting errors and/or for guiding the use and evolution of the ontology), for finding other datasets that could be easily integrated, and others. In this paper we focus on such catalogs, and in particular we showcase a catalog for datasets expressed with respect to CIDOC-CRM. Even if there are dozens of datasets that are represented using CIDOC-CRM, there is not any online resource that contains even a simple textual list of all these datasets. To fill this gap, we present an interactive portal that contains ontology-based descriptions for 30 CIDOC-CRM datasets. Through this portal, the user can browse all CIDOC-CRM datasets (and their statistics), can find all datasets that use a particular CIDOC-CRM property/class, can see the most frequent properties and classes, can check the commonalities between different datasets, and can enrich the catalog with new datasets. Finally, we provide indicative measurements over the 30 collected CIDOC-CRM datasets and for the properties/classes of the current version of CIDOC-CRM. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The cultural world offers a staggering amount of rich and varied metadata on cultural heritage, accumulated by governmental, academic, and commercial players. However, the variety of involved institutions means that the data are stored in as many complex and often incompatible models and standards, which limits its availability and explorability by the greater public. The adoption of Linked Open Data technologies allows a strong interlinking of these various databases as well as external connections with existing knowledge bases. However, as they often contain references to the same entities, the delicate issue of entity alignment becomes the central challenge, especially in the absence or scarcity of unique global identifiers. To tackle this issue, we explored two approaches, one based on a set of heuristic rules and one based on masked language models, or masked language models (MLMs). We compare these two approaches, as well as different variations of MLMs, including some models trained on a different language, and various levels of data cleaning and labeling. Our results show that heuristics are a solid approach but also that MLM-based entity alignment obtains better performance coupled with the fact that it is robust to the data format and does not require any form of data preprocessing, which was not the case of the heuristic approach in our experiments. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Cultural heritage institutions have recently started to share their metadata as Linked Open Data (LOD) in order to disseminate and enrich them. The publication of large bibliographic data sets as LOD is a challenge that requires the design and implementation of custom methods for the transformation, management, querying and enrichment of the data. In this report, the methodology defined by previous research for the evaluation of the quality of LOD is analysed and adapted to the specific case of Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples containing standard bibliographic information. The specified quality measures are reported in the case of four highly relevant libraries. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of maintaining CIDOC CRM-based knowledge graph (KG) by non-expert users. We present a practical method using Wikibase and specific data input conventions for creating and editing linked data that can be exported as CIDOC CRM compliant RDF. Wikibase is a proven and maintained software for generic KG maintenance with a fixed but flexible data model and easy-to-use user interface. It runs the collaboratively edited Wikidata KG, as well as increasing amount of domain specific services. The proposed solution introduces a set of data input conventions for Wikibase that can be used to generate CIDOC CRM compliant RDF without programming. The process relies on the aforementioned data input rules combined with generic mapping implementations and metadata stored as part of the KG. We argue that this convention over coding makes the system more easily approachable and maintainable for users that want to adhere to the CIDOC CRM principles, but are not ontology experts. As part of the preliminary evaluation of the proposed solution, an example on managing Cultural Heritage data in the military history domain with discussion on the limitations of the approach is presented. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The Cultural Heritage (CH) domain is a field where many different visual media are constituent elements of the main activities: study, conservation, dissemination, and presentation to the public (museum visitors, tourists, practitioners). Those media are usually used in isolation, adopting specific visualization tools. This paper aims to present several experiences where multiple visual media have been used in a coordinated manner by fusing or presenting them in the same visualization context. These approaches experimented with new interaction and visualization methodologies to use different media in a synergic way. CH domain is an ideal field of experimentation of the potential of media integration/fusion/ cross-analysis. According to our understanding, using multiple media can improve insight capability. We guide the reader in the analysis of some pioneering experiences and approaches and try to deduce, for each of them, the potential improvement granted in terms of data communication or analysis. A final discussion tries to highlight the work needed for a wider acceptance and increased impact of those approaches. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - With the digitization of archives, fragments of cultural heritage are migrating to dedicated platforms and made available in curated experiences that rely on the curators' work. Polariscope proposes a collaborative storytelling platform to share, visualize and co-create collective memories. It aims to gather citizens and institutions to promote rich digital experiences through interactive and narrative visualizations around meaningful cultural events. The project proposes a solution assisted by Artificial Intelligence (AI) able to generate automatic stories based on these archives. The development methodology and the architecture model of the integration of AI tools are presented in the paper. The paper also presents some promising preliminary results of user testing to achieve such a goal, based on the development of an interaction protocol with GPT 3.5 for the creation of stories. © 2024 ACM.

AB  - Ontologies are valuable tools for structuring and organizing knowledge, improving communication and data integration, enhancing information retrieval and search, and supporting various applications in different fields. They play a crucial role in promoting shared understanding and knowledge management in complex and information-rich domains. An examination of the initiatives conducted over the past decade in the field of cultural heritage has clearly highlighted the lack of an established framework in the conceptual modeling of information resources, despite the numerous ontologies created as a function of the many projects for the publication of linked open data. As a result, it is far from easy to know exhaustively all the ontologies available in relation to one’s field of interest and to obtain in an easy and systematic way a reliable assessment about their representative capacity and their degree of semantic interoperability. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - The popularity of Mobile has led to the rapid development of mobile learning. Especially for applications in Intangible Cultural Heritage education, many mobile learning systems have been produced. However, few systems have been evaluated for usability. In this paper, we evaluated the Intangible Cultural Heritage Based Augmented Reality Mobile Learning Application developed, using heuristic evaluation conducted by five evaluators to examine 10 heuristics. The results show that the minimalist design is more accessible for users. Finally, we have the system for our users' testing. They all think that this system can increase their knowledge of Intangible Cultural Heritage.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Cultural heritage institutions store and digitize large amounts of multimedia data inside archives to make archival records findable by archivists, scientists, and general public. Cataloging standards vary from archive to archive and, therefore, the sharing and use of this data are limited. To solve this issue, linked open data (LOD) is rising as an essential paradigm to open and provide access to the archival resources. Archives which are opened to the world knowledge benefit from external connections by enabling the application of automated approaches to process archival records, helping all stakeholders to gain valuable insights. In this paper, we present the Archive Dynamics Ontology (ArDO) - an ontology designed for describing the hierarchical nature of archival multimedia data, as well as its application on the example of archival resources about the Weimar Republic. Furthermore, ArDO semantically organizes multimedia archival resources in form of texts, images, audios, and videos by representing the dynamics related to their classification over time. ArDO tracks the changes of a specific hierarchical classification schema referred to as systematics adopted to organize archival resources under semantically defined keywords. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Historic buildings face multi-faceted fire risks that threaten their conservation. A comprehensive fire risk assessment is essential to prevent fires and protect cultural heritage. Conventional practices rely on surveys and site visits, which are inefficient in capturing up-to-date information digitally and analyzing the risk levels quantitatively. This paper proposes a framework integrating Historic Building Information Models (HBIM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to enable automated, data-driven fire risk assessment of historic buildings. The framework consists of two key phases: quantitative fire risk modeling and automated risk assessment. The risk modeling defines unified indicators in accordance with fire safety regulations to quantify the risks exposed to the heritage buildings internally and externally. Both inherent building characteristics (e.g. fire resistance rating) and external spatial characteristics (e.g. adjacent access and spatial separation) were assessed. Next, the automated assessment utilizes HBIM and GIS to extract building and surrounding area information, compute the quantitative risks, and develop an interactive visualization platform to facilitate stakeholders in decision-making. The feasibility of this framework is verified through a case study of Mandarin’s House in Macau. The results indicated the framework is capable of quantifying the risk related to fire-resistant materials (0.66), external access (0.75) and separation (0.76). The results demonstrate that the proposed framework could contribute a unified fire risk model quantification method and a BIM and GIS-combined mechanism for automated risk assessment to support the proactive conservation of valuable cultural heritage assets. © 2024 ISARC.

AB  - Tools for HEritage Science Processing, Integration, and ANalysis (THESPIAN) is a cloud system that offers multiple web services to the researchers of INFN-CHNet, from storing their raw data to reusing them by following the FAIR principles for establishing integration and interoperability among shared information. The injection in the CHNet cloud database of data and metadata (the latter modelled on a CIDOC-based ontology called CRMhs [20]) is performed by using the cloud service THESPIAN-Mask. THESPIAN-NER is a tool based on a deep neural network for Named Entity Recognition (NER), which will ease the data extraction from the database, enabling users to upload.pdf or.txt files and obtain named entities and keywords to be fetched in the metadata entries of the database. The neural network, on which THESPIAN-NER relies, is based on a set of open-source NLP models; transfer learning was employed to customise the Named Entity Recognition output of the models to match the CRMhs ontology properties. The service is now available in alpha version to researchers on the CHNet cloud. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Iconography and iconology are fundamental domains when it comes to understanding artifacts of cultural heritage (CH). Iconography deals with the study and interpretation of visual elements depicted in artifacts and their symbolism, while iconology delves deeper, exploring the underlying cultural and historical meanings. Despite the advances in representing CH with Linked Open Data (LOD), recent studies show persistent gaps in the representation of iconographic and iconological statements in current knowledge graphs (KGs). To address them, this paper presents IICONGRAPH, a KG that was created by refining and extending the iconographic and iconological statements of ArCo (the Italian KG of CH) and Wikidata. The development of IICONGRAPH was also driven by a series of requirements emerging from research case studies expressed in competency questions (CQs) that were unattainable in the non-reengineered versions of the KGs. The evaluation results demonstrate that IICONGRAPH not only outperforms ArCo and Wikidata through domain-specific assessments from the literature but also serves as a robust platform for answering the formulated CQs. IICONGRAPH is released and documented in accordance with the FAIR principles to guarantee the resource’s reusability. The algorithms used to create it and assess the CQs have also been made available to ensure transparency and reproducibility. While future work focuses on ingesting more data into the KG, and on implementing it as a backbone of LLM-based question answering systems, the current version of IICONGRAPH still emerges as a valuable asset, contributing to the evolving landscape of CH representation within KGs, the Semantic Web, and beyond. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic approach for relational exploration in cultural heritage knowledge graphs, exploiting Large Language Models (LLMs) for explanation generation and a mathematically grounded model to quantify the interestingness of relationships. We demonstrate the importance of the proposed interestingness measure through a quantitative analysis, highlighting its significant impact on system performance, particularly in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score. Utilizing the Wikidata Cultural Heritage Linked Open Data (WCH-LOD) dataset, our approach achieves a precision of 0.70, recall of 0.68, and an F1-score of 0.69, outperforming both graph-based (precision: 0.28, recall: 0.25, F1-score: 0.26) and knowledge-based (precision: 0.45, recall: 0.42, F1-score: 0.43) baselines. Furthermore, the proposed LLM-powered explanations exhibit better quality, as evidenced by higher BLEU (0.52), ROUGE-L (0.58), and METEOR (0.63) scores compared to baseline approaches. We further demonstrate a strong correlation (0.65) between the interestingness measure and the quality of generated explanations, validating its ability to guide the system towards more relevant discoveries. This system offers more effective exploration by achieving more diverse and human-interpretable relationship explanations compared to purely knowledge-based and graph-based methods, contributing to the knowledge-based systems field by providing a personalized and adaptable relational exploration framework. © 2025 by the author.

AB  - Traditional cultural heritage education mainly relies on the museum's display design and supplementation of exogenous materials, and most digital cultural heritage displays are based on the same principle. This process makes it difficult for tourists to absorb cultural knowledge actively and effectively. This article proposes a serious game of cultural heritage education based on the experiential learning cycle model, which provides a single-player experience environment on the computer with 3D modeling in the context of cultural heritages, and strengthens people's active construction of cultural heritage knowledge through game narrative, interaction and knowledge cards. Subsequently, a user test was conducted to verify whether the game design plays a role in real users. A total of 55 postgraduates participated in the experiment. Results show that The proposed design is feasible and can play a positive role in enhancing the learning effect, learning experience and learning initiative of learners, but more comprehensive tests are still needed to better investigate its use in formal education environments. © 2021 IEEE

AB  - Incorporating linked data-based models into the process of describing cultural objects is increasingly important for cultural heritage. Communities such as libraries, archives, and museums have developed and adopted models specific to their contexts. Without a trivial solution, choosing models to support more general applications is challenging. This Ph.D. aims to analyze existing solutions and practices in these domains and propose validated solutions for the discovery, access, interoperability, and reuse of cultural objects, following the FAIR principles. Transversal to the base models used, this research intends to adopt solutions that balance the simplicity of the models with the satisfaction of the requirements. © 2022 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

AB  - This paper presents first results of ArtSampo, a collaborative Finnish Linked Open Data (LOD) infrastructure for publishing fine art collections on the Semantic Web and for facilitating Digital Humanities (DH) research. The infrastructure consists of a Knowledge Graph (KG) whose initial version was compiled from the metadata of the three art museums of the Finnish National Gallery. A semantic ArtSampo portal was built on top of the KG for searching, browsing, and analyzing the underlying data. The Finnish ontology infrastructure and international datasets are used for harmonizing and enriching the data. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Batik is an Indonesian traditional craft that has high artistic value. Indonesian society, especially the younger generation such as students, plays an important role in preserving Indonesian culture such as batik to ensure it remains attached to Indonesia and does not disappear. However, the interest and enthusiasm of students in preserving batik is still lacking, so new strategies are needed to increase their interest and enthusiasm in preserving batik. One of the new strategies is utilizing immersive technology such as Mixed Reality (MR) with the implementation of gamification interaction to enhance students' interest because learning is done as if playing a game. MR technology can provide users with a more complex experience by using MR glasses. The Membatik application is a batik-making simulation application using MR technology where users can simulate with hand gestures and there are quizzes at each stage with a point system as a gamification implementation. The application has been tested with initial user testing. During the testing phase, users were asked to try the application and provide feedback on the overall user experience. The outcomes demonstrated that the MR application might raise students' interest in and involvement in their study. The users also found the quiz feature to be interactive and challenging, which added to their learning experience. By combining gamification elements with MR technology, the application has the potential to improve learning outcomes and increase student motivation.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Historical architectural archives enjoy attention from diverse audiences, acting as a primary source of information for architects, historians, public authorities, and common citizens alike. In Italy, the interest in architectural archives has grown slowly but steadily for the last 20 years. However, architectural archives do not generally follow the trend common for museums and galleries in publishing digitized materials and providing standard metadata for individual records. The information that is available online usually includes only an archival finding aid, instead of metadata about the individual records, or fully digital versions of the records. While cataloguing standards for archival descriptions of architectural records have existed at least since the 1980s, the rise of Linked Open Data as a framework for publishing cultural heritage data has allowed archivists to enhance these archival descriptions with richer contextual information and links to external knowledge bases. In this paper we present the ITDT ontology, an extension of the Records in Contexts Ontology that facilitates the representation of architectural records and of the context related to architectural projects, its process, and participating entities. We discuss the application of the ontology to the project files of Italian architect and engineer Dino Tamburini (1924–2011), and the creation of a digital archive offering multiple perspectives over the records. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - This paper introduces the project Tools of Knowledge: Modelling the Scientific Instrument Trade, 1550–1914, and focuses on our ongoing development of an ontology to represent knowledge about scientific instrument types produced during this period. After a brief introduction, we discuss the background to the project and a summary of previous work related to knowledge representation of scientific instrument types, particularly in the area of Linked Open Data. We continue with an explanation of the methods used to normalize and structure our data, as well as the vocabularies used to describe relationships between terms. Our interim findings comprise our reflections on the nature of these complex relationships and their semantic representation, alongside examples of analysis that has been facilitated through application of the ontology-in-progress to the project database. To conclude, we summarize our findings so far and provide an indication of how we might expand and enhance the ontology, as well as its contribution to the wider Linked Open Data ecosystem. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Ruins of ancient cities hold valuable information for historians and archeologists and it allows them to learn about the society and culture of these cities. This paper explores the first attempt to virtually rebuild the historic city of Karakorum based on ruins and archeological findings from the 13th century AD. Further, the analytical and practical methods used to discover its unique urban planning and architectural form by reconstructing the city using various resources from archeological documents to historical science documents are introduced. We explore a digitized version of Karakorum city in an immersive and embodied manner because of the latest technological advances in virtual reality, and this allows us to conserve and visualize its cultural heritage. The research objectives of this study are to (1) create a three-dimensional visual model of the Karakorum city as close as possible to its real counterpart, and (2) use a game engine as a development platform for integration and interactive visualization. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The digital humanities have witnessed a clear development in recent years due partly to their adoption of Semantic Web and linked data technologies and the creation of knowledge bases. In this work, we target the creation of an ontology and knowledge base for literature data representation based on the IFLA Library Reference Model (LRM). IFLA LRM is the main model for book-related data, allowing for a fine representation of the various layers that constitute a book. However, by design, it doesn't deal with some aspects usually available in literature databases, such as information about authors, literary awards or book themes. As a result, LRM requires some extensions to be able to represent ancillary data. Another challenge is the querying of IFLA LRM knowledge bases, with a performance cost that comes with the fine-grained expressivity of the LRM model, which creates longer and therefore typically slower SPARQL queries. In this work, we propose an extension to the IFLA LRM ontology called IFLA LRM∗that targets these limitations including a connection to the vocabulary Schema.org and to the taxonomies Thema and Dewey Decimal, and the representation of literary awards. We also present a practical case study on using our extended model to create a Quebec literature knowledge base, discussing the interest of our extensions.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Digital tools, technologies, and infrastructures have increasingly shaped how knowledge is understood, created, managed, maintained, and shared. In sectors such as cultural heritage, for example, curators and scholars now widely apply computer science approaches to their collections for tasks such as enriching content and providing users with visual access. Although there has been an increasing interest in critical digital visual design and cultural heritage, what still seems to be largely missing is a problematised and critical approach to the application of these techniques. Drawing on critical posthumanities, in this article I propose a new critical framework, the post-authentic framework to digital objects and cultural heritage. The framework advocates transparency and openness as well as the active and reflexive participation of the scholar/curator in the process of knowledge production. To exemplify how the post-authentic framework may be applied to digital research, I explore two use cases: critical visualisation design and critical digital heritage research. For the first use case, I examine the design choices for developing the tool DeXTER, an interactive visualisation app that allows users to explore enriched cultural heritage material interactively. I specifically emphasise the challenges facing product design, with a focus on visualising the ambiguities and uncertainties of Network Analysis and Sentiment Analysis. For the second use case, I explore the potential of DeXTER for testing hypotheses on large textual collections, for example by accessing the layers of meaning attached to referential entities. The use case is the Italian American labour movement from 1898 to 1936. The article concludes with key concepts and methods for applying the post-authentic framework to digital heritage practices and knowledge creation more widely.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - This paper discusses current challenges in archaeological cultural heritage data management and presents the interdisciplinary research project DigiNUMA. The project investigates solutions in data harmonisation and dissemination of pan-European cultural heritage through an interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral project in Digital Humanities, semantic computing, participatory heritage, museum collections management and archaeological/numismatic studies. Using Finnish and English numismatic data as a test case, DigiNUMA creates ontological infrastructure and a proof-of-concept data model for finely-grained Linked Open Data (LOD) harmonisation across national and international databases for cultural heritage data, and tests it through a broad suite of Digital Humanities analyses. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Museums, heritage agencies and other institutions responsible for managing archaeological cultural heritage across Europe are engaged in developing digital platforms to better open their collections to the public as a common resource for the purposes of discovering, learning about, and sharing our common past. This paper explores the potential of new semantic computing technologies in democratizing not only public access to digital cultural heritage records, but also to computational and Linked Open Data -assisted data analysis and knowledge discovery. As a case study, we consider archaeological and numismatic Open Data services in Finland, and discuss the research results obtained during the ongoing development work for the CoinSampo framework for opening Finnish and international numismatic data. Existing digital cultural heritage services are often built with the needs of professional collections management in mind. The presentation of the records is typically structured after the familiar format established for the printed catalogues of yesteryear, with few analytical tools that would take advantage of the potential of digital data to probe and visualize internal relationships and patterns within the full body of the opened material. CoinSampo, however, will provide scientific tools to new audiences among the non-professional public who have not enjoyed such a level of access to numismatic data. The broad range of target audiences we envisage includes collections managers, who will benefit from enhanced access to their own data for updating records and for error detection and correction, as well as academic researchers interested in using the material in scientific analysis. Importantly, it also includes non-professional groups such as coin collectors, educators, local historians, and the archaeological hobby metal-detectorists who produce most of the new coin finds entering the national collections in Finland and in other European countries where detecting is legal. By adopting a citizen science and participatory heritage approach in the development of Open Data services, we aim to promote a technological model for cultural heritage dissemination that addresses the needs of a wide spectrum of different user audiences inside and outside the professional sphere. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The aim of this paper is to form an analytical and critical framework to consider the uses of digital platforms in heritage field and practices and to provide methodologies for user profiling based on the identification of local stakeholders and their needs. Within the context of the EU H2020 research project RURITAGE, a resource ecosystem (RRE) of various integrated tools was created for shaping and addressing heritage-led knowledge and bottom-up strategies of local regeneration. More specifically, the RRE was conceived to provide local stakeholders with new methodologies and user-friendly tools based on bottom-up processes for identifying and actioning heritage and territorial features and turning these cultural natural values—as well as the gaps—into opportunities. This paper undertakes a comparative analysis of the integration of tools in other digital platforms for heritage practices and/or regeneration processes to explore the holistic approach to heritage knowledge and the effectiveness in engaging local stakeholders. In addition, it frames methodologies for local stakeholder and related needs identification. Through this comparative analysis among digital heritage platforms and through user profiling to target the needs of users by using the RRE as a case study, the paper explores the challenge of helping communities to shape a local heritage-led collaborative knowledge supported by integrated and user-friendly digital tools and to activate them in preserving and exploiting their territories and building shared and plural cultural heritage understandings, considering cultural heritage as a social need. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Lublin is a city located in the eastern part of Poland, which is an important place of cultural heritage, being the venue where the Polish-Lithuanian Union was signed 450 years ago in 2019. This article presents "Architectural Jewels of Lublin,"a computerized serious board game for two players. The aim of the game is to collect points for recognizing models of the city's historic architectural objects and their correct position on the board. They represent the landmarks of the historic Old Town quarter. Another point of the game is to answer questions about the cultural heritage of Lublin. 3D models of historic buildings were initially designed manually and then 3D printed in FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) technology. The correct location of the object on the board is identified by sensors working in the RFID (Radio-Frequency IDentification) technology supported by two microcontrollers of an Arduino platform, which were connected to the software managing the whole game shown on a tablet monitor. The game is used both to promote Lublin at numerous cyclical cultural and science popularization events, and during conferences and seminars organized for circles representing cultural heritage from Poland and abroad. It is aimed at presenting a way to integrate many different contemporary digital technologies that can serve education in the area of cultural heritage. The game, in contrast to popular games using VR and AR technologies, combines in an interesting way physical and digital space using modern computer technologies. The research carried out on the participants of the game has shown its high effectiveness in raising the historical awareness of its participants, as well as the players' positive attitude toward the game.  © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Aim of my research is to exploit Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) as base for advanced Cultural Heritage (CH) fruition by means of Automatic Story Generation (ASG). Following the rationale that discovering and reviving already existing (yet latent) narratives is worthier than automatically generating them from anew in eliciting the user's interest, the input-2-graph and the graph-2-sequence ASG-pipeline phases, heavily relying on LLOD, will be given a deeper focus, whereby the final Natural Language Generation (NLG) module will be constrained by the entities and relations established in the Knowledge Graph (KG) generation modules (a configuration typical of the neurosymbolic approach). In order to enhance possibilities of implementation in real-life contexts, the elaborated pipeline will be modular, i.e. self-sufficient in its constituent parts. Beyond the countless possible application scenarios ranging from education to entertainment, this solution detangles the user from his role of mere consumer, and empowers him not only to control the creation process [3.1], but also to find already within it, and not necessarily in the final outcome, a valuable source for intellectual growth. This work intends the addressing of a specific societal need as an avalanche to simultaneously fill knowledge gaps identified in and among the related scientific domains. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The use of eXtended Reality (XR) technologies, including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR), has become increasingly popular in museums to enhance the visitor experience. However, the impact of XR technologies on Learning Performance in the context of archeological museums needs to be better understood. This study aims to investigate the relationships between Usability, Presence and Learning Performance by developing XR experiences showcasing archeological artefacts and conducting user testing to evaluate their effectiveness. A laboratory test is conducted to compare a VR application with a mobile AR one, presenting the digital models of five archeological findings. Descriptive statistics are used to compare the two case studies, providing valuable insights into the impact of XR technologies on the visitor experience from a learning perspective. The study confirms that Usability has a more significant effect on learning than Presence and can help designers and museum managers better understand the factors contributing to a successful XR experience. The findings suggest that while Presence is an important factor in improving visitors’ experience, Usability should be the priority when designing XR experiences for museums. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce LagunAR, a mobile outdoor Augmented Reality (AR) application for providing heritage information and 3D visualization on a city scale. The LagunAR application was developed to provide historical information about the city of La Laguna in the XVI century, when it was the main city in the Canary Islands. The application provides a reconstructed 3D model of the city at that time that is shown on a mobile phone over-imposed on the actual city using geolocation. The geolocated position is used also for providing information of several points of interest in the city. The paper describes the design and implementation of the application and details the optimization techniques that have been used to manage the full information of the city using a mobile phone as a sensor and visualization tool. We explain the application usability study carried out using a heuristic test; in addition it is probed by users in a qualitative user test developed as preliminary research. Results show that it is possible to develop a real-time application that shows the user a city-scale 3D model and also manages the information of the points of interest. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - For some decades now, Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM) institutions have published and provided access to information resources in digital format. Recently, innovative approaches have appeared such as the concept of Labs within GLAM institutions that facilitates the adoption of innovative and creative tools for content delivery and user engagement. In addition, new methods have been proposed to address the publication of digital collections as data sets amenable to computational use. In this article, we propose a methodology to create machine actionable collections following a set of steps. This methodology is then applied to several use cases based on data sets published by relevant GLAM institutions. It intends to encourage institutions to adopt the publication of data sets that support computationally driven research as a core activity. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Museums and cultural heritage institutions have an important role in presenting accurate information and sharing cultural knowledge, and new technologies are increasingly implemented. For the best results, the appropriateness of a specific technology must be evaluated for each context. Research has shown the need for participatory methods and local knowledge in Indigenous design contexts. We describe a case study where an Indigenous Sámi museum exhibition was augmented with interactive technology through multidisciplinary co-design work with museum experts, designers, and developers. The traditional clothing of the Sámi people was digitized by filming, and information related to it was presented as a touchscreen installation in a renewed exhibition. User tests including interactive tasks and interviews (n = 7) and a questionnaire (n = 27) were completed on-site. The installation was rated interesting and easy to use, while some users struggled to find all the features. Our study shows that a technically relatively simple digital installation can be easy-to-use but interesting for a standard museum visitor. Additionally, the work demonstrates how to build successful collaborations that highlight Indigenous cultural heritage. We discuss the implications of using technology to promote cultural heritage and identities. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Knowledge is the lifeblood for a plethora of applications such as search, recommender systems and natural language understanding. Thanks to the efforts in the fields of Semantic Web and Linked Open Data a growing number of interlinked knowledge bases are supporting the development of advanced knowledge-based applications. Unfortunately, for a large number of domain-specific applications, these knowledge bases are unavailable. In this paper, we present a resource consisting of a large knowledge graph linking the Italian cultural heritage entities (defined in the ArCo ontology) with the concepts defined on well-known knowledge bases (i.e., DBpedia and the Getty GVP ontology). We describe the methodologies adopted for the semi-automatic resource creation and provide an in-depth analysis of the resulting interlinked graph. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC-4.0.

AB  - The continuous growth of available resources on the web, both in the form of Linked Open Data and on Social Networks, provides an important opportunity to gather information concerning specific kinds of touristic activities like, for example, cultural tourism, eco-tourism, bike-tourism, and so on. Both decision makers and tourists can take advantage from these data, as demonstrated by previous works, with institutional actors foreseeing an increase in the use of this data to substitute other time-consuming and expensive approaches. However, managing multiple sources built with different goals and structures is not straightforward, so specific design choices must be made when assembling this kind of information. Graph databases represent an ideal way to combine multiple-source data but, to be successful, strategies accounting for inconsistencies and format differences have to be defined to support coherent analysis. Also, the continuously changing nature of crowd-sourced data makes it difficult, for the research community, to compare technological approaches to the different tasks that are linked to cultural heritage, from recommendation to management. To support the research effort in this direction, we describe the data ingestion and enrichment procedure we followed to organise knowledge coming from three different sources, namely Wikidata, Wikipedia, and Flickr, into a single, application-oriented, resource organised as a graph database. We present the potential use of this resource to perform multiple source analyses targeting the specific case of cultural tourism on a nationwide scale, and we propose its use as a shared benchmark for technological applications designed to support optimal management of cultural resources.  © 2021 ACM.

AB  - This article introduces an innovative digital modelling method tailored for ICH using the functionality of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In order to further improve the performance of CNN, we seamlessly integrated a genetic algorithm (GA) into the system, thus establishing an immersive interactive visual learning environment. This integration utilizes GA's proficiency in conducting comprehensive global searches and its ability to optimize through genetic operations such as crossover and mutation iteratively. The parameters of CNN are fine-tuned based on the fitness value, which represents the most accurate solution with the smallest deviation. This study has achieved remarkable results. Compared with traditional modelling techniques, CAD technology has shown significant advantages in modelling accuracy. In terms of visual teaching, CAD technology enables students to intuitively understand the structure and characteristics of intangible cultural heritage by creating realistic 3D models. This intuitive teaching method not only stimulates students' interest in learning but also helps them gain higher cultural and material value. This method helps to promote a deeper appreciation and understanding of our rich cultural heritage among the younger generation. © 2024 U-turn Press LLC.

AB  - Nowadays, many technologies are changing our way of life, including those related to extended reality. One of the most interesting is Augmented Reality (AR). Today, even if this technology seems to be discovered yet, it is widely applied in several contexts, including the fruition and conservation of cultural heritage. Such spread is mainly offered by the new and more powerful mobile devices, allowing museums and art exhibitions to use AR to offer new experiences to visitors. In this paper, we present an augmented reality mobile system based on content-based image analysis techniques and Linked Open Data to improve the user knowledge about cultural heritage. We use different image analysis techniques, and we present several experimental results to show the performance of our system. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a trend towards synergies among cultural heritage institutions, such as GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives & Museums) collaborations in the field of information resource management. These institutions have been actively promoting the construction of digital humanities projects. Such projects primarily target data resource construction and digital humanities services, which are in line with the service functions of GLAM institutions. With the development of networking and digitisation, museums have been making more prominent contributions to knowledge sharing and dissemination.Digital technology has brought about profound changes in the academic research environment. The expansion of traditional research and the emergence of new questions in the digital environment have promoted novel perspectives, thinking, and methods. With the increase in digitisation of cultural heritage, the scale of data has grown rapidly, and the types of data available have been continuously enriched, from knowledge aggregation to knowledge organization and even knowledge transmission. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the tools of digital humanities, which constitute an important means of knowledge production, and to work with traditional GLAM institutions to promote digital thinking and interdisciplinary knowledge integration methods. At the technical level, methods such as knowledge graphs and ontologies are used to construct a multi-layered and systematic knowledge system. This paper presents a review focused on three cultural heritage models, CIDOC CRM, Europeana and the Sampo Model, and reflects on three aspects of the current models: Technical framework construction, digital resources, and service systems. © 2023 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

AB  - This paper shows how the newly published Linked Open Data (LOD) service and semantic portal “AcademySampo - Finnish Academic People 1640-1899” can be used for Digital Humanities (DH) research. The original primary data, based on some ten man-years of digitization work, covers a significant part of the Finnish university history based on the student registries in 1640-1852 and 1853-1899. They contain biographical descriptions of 28 000 students of the University of Helsinki, originally the Royal Academy of Turku. AcademySampo also sheds light to the academic history of Sweden and Baltic countries through their shared history with Finland in the larger Swedish Empire. The Finnish student registries have been widely used by genealogists and historians by close reading. We argue that unprecedented new possibilities for DH research are now enabled by using AcademySampo: the underlying knowledge graph can be accessed and analyzed using Semantic Web technologies and tools and with the ready-to-use data-analytic tools of the portal. Examples of data-analysis are presented by using the AcademySampo system for studying migrations of students in Finland, Sweden, Russia, and Estonia, history of student nations, inheritance of vocations and social classes, lengths of family lines of students, and network analyses of students. Related analyses have been made before using biographical dictionaries but not for academic history and student registries. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Archives are facing numerous challenges. On the one hand, archival assets are evolving to encompass digitized documents and increasing quantities of born-digital information in diverse formats. On the other hand, the audience is changing along with how it wishes to access archival material. Moreover, the interoperability requirements of cultural heritage repositories are growing. In this context, the Portuguese Archives started an ambitious program aiming to evolve its data model, migrate existing records, and build a new archival management system appropriate to both archival tasks and public access. The overall goal is to have a fine-grained and flexible description, more machine-actionable than the current one. This work describes ArchOnto, a linked open data model for archives, and rules for its automatic population from existing records. ArchOnto adopts a semantic web approach and encompasses the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model and additional ontologies, envisioning interoperability with datasets curated by multiple communities of practice. Existing ISAD(G)-conforming descriptions are being migrated to the new model using the direct mappings provided here. We used a sample of 25 records associated with different description levels to validate the completeness and conformity of ArchOnto to existing data. This work is in progress and is original in several respects: (1) it is one of the first approaches to use CIDOC CRM in the context of archives, identifying problems and questions that emerged during the process and pinpointing possible solutions; (2) it addresses the balance in the model between the migration of existing records and the construction of new ones by archive professionals; and (3) it adopts an open world view on linking archival data to global information sources. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Historically, the ability to reproduce visual works in print for comparison and detailed illustration has been crucial for art historical research and its dissemination. While this has always been possible, the study of big monolithic visual heritage can be greatly streamlined by an interactive digital research environment. The goal of our research is to develop an annotation platform that leverages linked open data to facilitate a thorough and scholarly description of big monolithic visual heritage. We will deploy our platform to craft a scholarly edition of the Murten Panorama (1894), offering high-quality, well-provenanced knowledge graph to both the public and scholars, giving them a window into the historical context of the creation of the 19th c. panoramic masterpiece. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The fruition of the cultural heritage in the pandemic era has been stressed even more towards online and virtual environments. Usually the web site publishing process involves many competences, or the ability of the single cultural operator, which needs to become expert in many complex techniques. In the paper we present the VIEd’ARTE Project, an experience of implementation of a web publication framework supporting the work of cultural operators with tools for the data access to repositories and for the page design of the web applications. An example is shown using the VIEd’ARTE framework for the design of the virtual tour “On the trail of the Renaissance”. The publication framework of VIEd’ARTE manages different types of cultural objects and many types of presentations. The front-end side features include templates and predefined layouts, supporting a presentation model for a large public. The back-end side offers access capabilities to SQL databases, in particular to BeWEB archives, which contain data of different types of cultural heritage assets. The metadata layer of the BeWeb Portal allows the integration of the various data fonts. The data access model will move in the next future to allow also no-SQL databases and OAI (Open Archives Initiative) or Linked Open Data protocols to access databases. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In the World Wide Web, a very large number of online cultural heritage (CH) resources is made available through digital museums websites. They display collections images and share collection metadata, which makes opportunities for aggregating. 'China Art in the Museums Overseas' platform aggregated China digital collections from overseas institutions. This paper introduces the metadata aggregation workflow of this project, especially a unified data model used to solve the metadata standards heterogeneity. Besides, this platform is not simply a database, but also provides search, images semantic annotation, knowledge graph serves, linked open data interface and so on. Our work is an effort to resolve multi-source data aggregation and it is valuable. It improves the availability and discoverability of digital collections, and spread Chinese culture to the public more widely. © 2022 Dublin Core metadata initiative. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper presents the adoption of semantic metadata design and domain entity linking to enrich an opera photographic digital collection, proving how to leverage the Semantic Web to get authoritative information to enrich metadata. The ongoing digitisation program of the photographic archive of the Teatro Comunale di Bologna produced so far more than 8 thousand images over a century of opera seasons. During the design of the browsing application, the initial requirement was to access photos by simple and domain related criteria. Given that the cataloguing process produced some very basic metadata, an LD-aided procedure was developed to enrich metadata through the alignment with two external Knowledge Bases (KBs): WikiData and Corago LOD, the KB about the Italian opera. The result is a web application based on the Omeka S platform that enables users to browse the collection by works, events or portrayed artists. The experimentation confirms both the feasibility and benefits resulting from the adoption of Linked Data to organise and enhance archival information in a performing arts case study. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The importance of paradata and metadata in fully complying with FAIR data principles is clear, particularly within the context of 3D models that are shared online through platforms such as Sketchfab [1], where it is expected that other users will want to use/reuse the models. Paradata and metadata serve crucial roles in elucidating the decision-making process behind the design and reconstruction of 3D models depicting historical sites or objects. The process of optimizing 3D models significantly impacts the documentary value and authenticity of the final model. Understanding the dynamics is essential for transparency and reliability in representing cultural heritage. At the same time, integrating metadata into an immersive web-based platform presents challenges as it risks disrupting the narrative flow. This paper uses the case study of the UNESCO Dive into Heritage (DIH) project, which combines reused existing 3D models, newly acquired 3D data captured by UNESCO, and original 3D models by UNOSAT to create an immersive experience. This paper aims to start a discussion about best practices on the representation of paradata on websites like the DIH platform that will enrich the user experience while ensuring scholarly rigor and authenticity are maintained throughout the exploration of cultural heritage and their narratives. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - This research explores the computational empowerment of intangible cultural heritage through interactive generative platforms. Prototypes in TouchDesigner software visualize traditional Kam minority patterns by applying particle system effects to highlight symbolic meanings. Users actively transform heritage visuals through real-time interaction, fostering cultural appreciation. Technical realization involves visual programming to construct specialized generative workflows. Phases of diffusion and dissipation of culturally significant motifs are configured procedurally. Preliminary explorations will inform training generative AI models by discerning cultural logic. The goal is an adaptive living database where tradition evolves algorithmically. This pioneering approach synergizes heritage and technology to maintain intangible culture. It provides a model for participatory digital curation where communities actively shape legacies. Limitations around complexity persist. However, the research pioneers cultural resilience through computational creativity. © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - In this work, we introduce ICON, an ontology that models artistic interpretations of artworks' subject matter (i.e., iconographies) and meanings (i.e., symbols, iconological aspects). Developed by conceptualizing authoritative knowledge and notions taken from Panofsky's levels of interpretation theory, ICON ontology focuses on the granularity of interpretations. It can be used to describe an interpretation of an artwork from the pre-iconographical, icongraphical, and iconological levels. Its main classes have been aligned to ontologies that come from the domains of cultural descriptions (ArCo, CIDOC-CRM, VIR), semiotics (DOLCE), bibliometrics (CITO), and symbolism (Simulation Ontology), to grant a robust schema that can be extendable using additional classes and properties coming from these ontologies. The ontology was evaluated through competency questions that range from simple recognition on a specific level of interpretation to complex scenarios. Data written using this model was compared to state-of-the-art ontologies and schemas to both highlight the current lack of a domain-specific ontology on art interpretation and show how our work fills some of the current gaps. The ontology is openly available and compliant with FAIR principles. With our ontology, we hope to encourage digital art historians working for cultural institutions in making more detailed linked open data about the content of their artifacts, to exploit the full potential of Semantic Web in linking artworks through not only subjects and common metadata but also specific symbolic interpretations, intrinsic meanings, and the motifs through which their subjects are represented. Additionally, by basing our work on theories made by different art history scholars in the last century, we make sure that their knowledge and studies will not be lost in the transition to the digital, linked open data era. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Visual analytic for intangible cultural heritage has recently developed in China. Using advanced interactive visualization tools experts can observe data distribution trends and explore the implicit relationships among data within a short time. It can enhance human cognitive and analytical abilities and improve the scientific preservation of intangible cultural heritage. To support this research topic, we have reviewed recent visualization works on intangible cultural heritage in China. We divide these works into three types: text visualization, multi-dimensional visualization, and geographical visualization. Each type is illustrated by several representative works. New development trends in this area are also discussed. © 2023 KIPS

AB  - Libraries have been digitizing their collections for years in order to provide users with enhanced access and improve preservation of library materials. This article studies how the linked data can be used to describe objects in the digital collections. Researchers selected a digital collection of the nineteenth-century British novels from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Library, and converted the metadata for 7,829 British novels from MARCXML to BIBFRAME 2.0. Their project demonstrates that the BIBFRAME 2.0 model is a feasible way to enhance the discoverability of digital collections within and beyond library communities. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The recovery and resilience of the cultural and creative sectors after the COVID-19 pandemic is a current topic with priority for the European Commission. Cultural gems is a crowdsourced web platform managed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission aimed at creating community-led maps as well as a common repository for cultural and creative places across European cities and towns. More than 130,000 physical locations and online cultural activities in more than 300 European cities and towns are currently tracked by the application. The main objective of Cultural gems consists in raising a holistic vision of European culture, reinforcing a sense of belonging to a common European cultural space. This data article describes the ontology developed for Cultural gems, adopted to represent the domain of knowledge of the application by means of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles and following the paradigms of Linked Open Data (LOD). We provide an overview of this dataset, and describe the ontology model, along with the services used to access and consume the data. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Exploration, analysis, and preservation of the rich cultural and historical tapestry of the world are essential for our understanding of humanity’s past and shaping our future. In recent years, there has been increased interest in the creation and application of Ontologies, Knowledge Graphs, and other Semantic Web Technologies within cultural heritage (CH) and digital humanities (DH). However, to date, the distinct areas of expertise, methodologies and traditions across the fields have led to a noticeable gap between tech solutions and humanities’ needs. The aim of the International Workshop of Semantic Digital Humanities (SemDH) was to bridge this division and encourage closer collaboration and networking across diverse fields. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Cultural gems is a web application conceived by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (DG JRC), which aims at engaging people and organizations across Europe to create a unique repository of cultural and creative places. The main goal is to provide a vision of European culture in order to strengthen a sense of identity within a single European cultural realm. Cultural gems maps more than 130,000 physical places in over 300 European cities and towns, and since 2020 it also lists online cultural initiatives. The new release aims, among other, to increase the interoperability of the application. At this purpose, we provide an overview on the current development of an ontology for Cultural gems used to map cultural heritage in European cities by using Linked Open Data (LOD) standards and making the data FAIR, that is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. We provide an overview of the methodology, presenting the structure of the ontology, and the services and tools we are currently building on top. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - New generations should learn about the Cultural Heritage (CH) that surrounds them to value and preserve it. Common strategies for learning CH include lectures, textbooks, and also cultural visits to CH sites. Cultural visits allow very rich learning experiences but are quite challenging to prepare and carry out. This paper presents Cultural Heritage Educational Semantic Tool (CHEST), a web application that enables teachers to identify monuments of interest and annotate them with learning tasks. The created learning tasks will be carried out by students using an existing application, named Casual Learn, that makes use of a dataset of learning tasks created from information available as Linked Open Data. CHEST overcomes an identified limitation of Casual Learn by giving the teachers the possibility of enriching the existing semantic dataset of monuments and associated learning tasks with customized content while hiding the technical complexity of Semantic Web technologies. Additionally, CHEST promotes the reusability and adaptation of learning tasks by different teachers. An early version of CHEST was used by two secondary school teachers in real-life situations to design customized tasks for their students. These tasks were then carried out by the students via Casual Learn. These teachers gave a high usability score to CHEST and were interviewed to obtain further feedback. They were keen to publish new tasks, share them with other teachers, and reuse tasks from other teachers. © 2022 ACM.

AB  - The Qiang people is an ancient minority in western China. However, Qiang language, as the carrier of Qiang culture and spirit, is rapidly fading as less and fewer people can speak it. Despite the fact that the serious game of indigenous language has been widely discussed, there is still a dearth of research on the Qiang language and culture. This research aims to determine the efficacy of serious games based on interactive projection to encourage people’s interest in Qiang language and culture. To better understand the Qiang language and cultural heritage’s current state and challenges, we conducted a three-day field investigation in the Qiang village. Based on the field study’s findings, we created “WhiteStone”, an interactive projection device based on the heroic epic of Qiang. Our user research consists of remote verification and user testing, indicating that serious games based on projected interaction have the potential to create engrossed and interesting experiences, which can attract young people’s interest in the Qiang language and culture. This paper examines the design opportunities for serious games based on interactive projection to revitalize the Qiang language and culture. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The phenomenon of aimless web navigation, often compared to falling”down the rabbit hole,” brings to light significant aspects of the Internet’s”long tail” concept. This research examines whether longer, non-goal-oriented web sessions genuinely lead users into the long tail of digital libraries, thereby exploring the discoverability of cultural heritage. The focus of this study is on Gallica, the French national library’s online platform. This work aims to identify and characterize such sessions within Gallica, defining rabbit holes as long and diversified navigation sessions. The difÏculty lies in identifying rabbit holes within server logs, which requires a mixed-methods approach involving interviews, qualitative studies, and simple statistical analyses. Despite Gallica’s lack of hypertextual structure, we show that users do engage in rabbit hole-like behavior, navigating through keyword searches and filters. The study’s findings align with user testimonies. A crucial conclusion is that rabbit holes in Gallica do not generally lead users to less-consulted content. This limitation is attributed to the search engine, which users must somewhat”hack” to navigate effectively. Enhancing Gallica’s discoverability tools without compromising the existing user experience is essential for improving content accessibility. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The purpose of controlled vocabularies is to organize information and to provide terminology to catalogue and retrieve information in information systems. Vocabularies provide definitions and scope notes, which is especially important in the field of cultural heritage, capturing the richness of meanings and relationships between terms. Therefore, they are important tools for data integrity control and providing reliable search and retrieval, and also essential educational resources. Currently, there are only two controlled vocabularies in the Croatian language related to the field of cultural heritage, primarily museum collections and the protection of cultural monuments: 1) the Classification of museum and gallery objects, 2) the Thesaurus of monument types. They overlap to some extent, but also differ according to the levels of specificity, exhaustivity and structure. As an initial method of vocabulary reconciliation, mapping based on Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) mapping properties is used. This paper aims to examine the possibilities and challenges of vocabulary reconciliation and to provide guidelines for the future use of these valuable terminological resources, to improve the users' access to cultural heritage. Additional mapping of both terminologies to the Art & Architecture Thesaurus will ensure interoperability in the global linked open data environment and provide a multilingual context. © 2022 Croatian Society MIPRO.

AB  - More and more publishers tend to create and upload their data as digital open data, and this is also the case for the Cultural Heritage (CH) domain. For facilitating their Data Interchange, Integration, Preservation and Management, publishers tend to create their data as Linked Open Data (LOD) and connect them with existing LOD datasets that belong to the popular LOD Cloud, which contains over 1,300 datasets (including more than 150 datasets of CH domain). Due to the high amount of available LOD datasets, it is not trivial to find all the datasets having commonalities (e.g., common entities) with a given dataset at real time. However, it can be of primary importance for several tasks to connect these datasets, for being able to answer more queries and in a more complete manner (e.g., for better understanding our history), for enriching the information of a given entity (e.g., for a book, a historical person, an event), for estimating the veracity of data, etc. For this reason, we present a research prototype, called ConnectionChecker, which receives as input a LOD Dataset, computes and shows the connections to hundreds of LOD Cloud datasets through LODsyndesis knowledge graph, and offers several measurements, visualizations and metadata for the given dataset. We describe how one can exploit ConnectionChecker for their own dataset, and we provide use cases for the CH domain, by using two real linked CH datasets: a) a dataset from the National Library of Netherlands, and b) a dataset for World War I from the Universities of Aalto and Helsinki. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The RESTORE project (smaRt accESs TO digital heRitage and mEmory) started in June 2020 with a duration of 2 years. The project consortium, coordinated by the Istituto Opera del Vocabolario Italiano of the Italian CNR (National Research Council of Italy), includes national Cultural Heritage institutes, such as the State Archives and the Museum of Palazzo Pretorio in Prato and the Archival and Bibliographic Superintendency of Tuscany, and the SPACE SpA software company. The project - co-financed by the Regione Toscana - has its main purpose in the recovery, integration and accessibility of data and digital objects collected by partner, in order to build a knowledge base made of information regarding the history of the city and of its civic institutions, the development of its economic and entrepreneurial system, the role of women in the development of a welfare state and network. Starting a local history approach, it is nonetheless possible to broaden the focus from the local dimension to reconstruct a significant part of the history of European and Mediterranean cities of the 14th century, including commercial and economical aspects. This paper presents a focused overview on the mapping and modeling of archival and museum digital resources encoded with different standards, such as XML-EAD, XML-EAC, XML-TEI and ICCD-OA, and covered in the CIDOC-Conceptual Reference Model, the ontology that was chosen as "common language"for semantic data integration. The long term sustainability for the project's results will be fostered by the collaboration with key players in the EU RIs environment, such as DARIAHERIC (ESFRI Landmark for the Humanities and Social Sciences) and E-RIHS (ESFRI project for the Heritage Science), as well as other actors within the EOSC Framework.  © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Datasets of reported damaged properties are vital for resilience efforts during and after wars. They are essential for the statistical analysis of damages and the distribution of funds and resources. This paper concentrates on these datasets to enhance the resilience of Ukraine's damaged cultural heritage sites and infrastructures as a result of the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war. More specifically, we use a semiautomatic approach to enrich such datasets and a linked data approach to improve the quality of published datasets and facilitate their integration. We demonstrate our approach by using a well cited dataset published by the UNESCO for damaged cultural properties and the ScienceAtRisk project for damaged educational and research infrastructures. Our final datasets consist of 2,910 and 389 triples respectively. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our datasets with three use cases. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The OperaSampo is a Linked Open Data (LOD) service and semantic portal for searching, browsing, and analyzing information related to opera and music theatre performances performed in Finland during 1830–1960. The key data originates from the Reprises database of the Sibelius Academy, Finland. This paper presents the conversion process of transforming the data into LOD, the data model created, as well as the portal developed for using the data. The novelty of OperaSampo lays on its focus on using and studying data about the musical performances and persons involved in different roles. The system is available for final testing on the Semantic Web and will be published for open use in October 2023. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) organisations host extensive digital collections that have been made available to the public for over three decades. Advances in technology have facilitated the reuse of digital collections as rich data sources. In this context, Wikidata has emerged as a leading, innovative, and collaborative platform that enriches the digital collections provided by GLAM institutions. However, a comprehensive analysis of the current status, potential and challenges of its use in the GLAM sector is still lacking. This paper presents a systematic review of Wikidata use in GLAM institutions within the context of the work of the International GLAM Labs Community (glamlabs.io). The results summarise academic literature on Wikidata projects. The paper argues that Wikidata’s potential in the domain of reuse, an important component of the FAIR principles, can be better integrated into the practices of GLAM institutions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - With the digital protection and development of cultural heritage as a focus, an analysis of the trends in cultural heritage digitization reveals the importance of digital technology in this field, as demonstrated by the application of virtual reality (VR) to the protection and development of the Lingjiatan site. The implementation of the Lingjiatan roaming system involves sequential steps, including image acquisition, image splicing, and roaming system production. A user test was conducted to evaluate the usability and user experience of the system. The results show that the system operates normally, with smooth interactive functions that allow users to tour the Lingjiatan site virtually. Users can learn about Lingjiatan's culture from this virtual environment. This study further explores the system's potential for site preservation and development, and its role in the integration of cultural heritage and tourism. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Traditional Wooden Carving in Quanzhou, China is a National Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH), which was established in Tang Dynasty (AD 686), and has a history of more than a thousand years. It is a narrative presentation of the life, culture and other daily respects of the people in southern Fujian province. The project focuses on the Wooden Carving Window Decoration in Southern Fujian Ancient Building, by using AI technology to extract features of the landscape, figures and various types of rare, exotic creatures in wooden carvings, their digital 3D models can be generated and presented, a comprehensive database of elements of wooden window carving can also be built. Furthermore, the human–computer interaction is supported by hand gesture recognition technology, allowing participants creatively design their own contemporary digitalized wood window carving. This project expects the interactive and narrative features of the digital wooden window carving model can trigger a deeper sense of identification with the traditional southern Fujian culture among the young generation and erase the distant feeling towards traditional ICH culture spatially and temporally. Moreover, it could also provide a new way of thinking for the innovative inheritance of ICH. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - The signature of the 2019 Declaration of Cooperation on advancing the digitization of cultural heritage in Europe shows the important role that the 3D digitization process plays in the safeguard and sustainability of cultural heritage. The digitization also aims at sharing and presenting cultural heritage. However, the processing steps of data acquisition to its presentation requires an interdisciplinary collaboration, where understanding and collaborative work is difficult due to the presence of different expert knowledge involved. This study proposes an end-to-end method from the cultural data acquisition to its presentation thanks to explicit semantics representing the different fields of expert knowledge intervening in this process. This method is composed of three knowledge-based processing steps: (i) a recommendation process of acquisition technology to support cultural data acquisition; (ii) an object recognition process to structure the unstructured acquired data; and (iii) an enrichment process based on Linked Open Data to document cultural objects with further information, such as geospatial, cultural, and historical information. The proposed method was applied in two case studies concerning the watermills of Ephesos terrace house 2 and the first Sacro Monte chapel in Varallo. These application cases show the proposed method’s ability to recognize and document digitized cultural objects in different contexts thanks to the semantics. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Embodied interaction is a significant direction within the realm of interaction design. Interaction design does not only enhance efficiency in people's lives; it focuses on how humans and computer systems interact efficiently and effectively. In embodied interaction, natural interactive behaviors can be employed to enhance experiences. Interaction is now omnipresent; it serves as an intermediary to establish connections and provide reflection, and not just consolidated within products like smartphones and computers. The incorporation of interaction design into physical life, intertwining with human behaviors and spatial environments, poses our contemplation. Thus, under the backdrop of sustainable development goals (SDGs), we adopted the direction of embodied interaction and utilized metaphors to create a tangible installation. We aspire for urban explorers to establish connections with the city in terms of time and space dimensions through interactive experiences, thereby comprehending the multifaceted nature of the city. Throughout the design process, we validated and iterated our designs via prototyping and user testing.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.

AB  - Architectural archives, usually held by private bodies, are important primary sources of information for architecture and urban development historians; for architects themselves, who research archives for inspiration and to prepare for restoration; and also for common citizens, who may find it interesting to discover the designs of their own homes. Cataloguing standards for archival descriptions of architectural records have existed at least since the 1980s, however, the rise of Linked Open Data as a framework for publishing cultural heritage data has allowed archivists to enhance the descriptions with rich contextual information and links to external knowledge bases. In this paper, we present an extension of RiC-Ontology designed for describing architectural archival records and the creative process that leads to their production, and we discuss its application to the project files of Italian architect and engineer Dino Tamburini (1924-2011). The ontology is suitable for representing typical architectural records such as drawings, written reports, bid documents and photographs, but also the different stages of an architectural project and their actors. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - To highlight and foster diabolo culture, we collaborated with the diabolo community using a participatory design methodology to co-create and refine a Digital Diabolo VR game. The comprehensive process encompassed preliminary research, design workshops, in-depth design, preliminary testing, and user testing, with varying degrees of engagement from the diabolo community at each phase. This endeavor culminated in the successful development and exhibition of the Digital Diabolo VR game, showcased at the Beijing Diabolo Museum and in public spaces, significantly contributing to the dissemination of diabolo culture. Additionally, it provided valuable insights into applying participatory design principles to the preservation and digitization of intangible cultural heritage.  © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - In recent years, the abundance of available scholarly information has requested constant development and revision of standardized models and shared guidelines. Based on these frameworks, the Digital Humanities (DH) landscape features a variety of aggregators expected to enhance research data findability while promoting use and reuse. However, current semantic models fail to capture the specificity of DH research products, hindering data discovery and hampering the valorisation of Cultural Heritage. The ATLAS project addresses these key challenges by developing a unified framework for describing and aggregating scholarly outputs, particularly in the Italian Digital Cultural Heritage domain. This paper presents the initial versions of the ATLAS Ontology and Knowledge Graph, designed to model DH outcomes such as Digital Scholarly Editions, text collections, Linked Open Data, ontologies, and software. In so doing, ATLAS aims to enhance resource findability and reuse, paving the way for improved interoperability and future advancements in the field. © 2025 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - There is a deluge of Cultural Heritage Linked Open Data containing detailed information (e.g., location, architectural styles, etc.). Teachers could use this Open Data to generate meaningful learning tasks. However, most teachers are not using this information. This may be because they are not aware of these information sources or because they have technological difficulties in accessing the information (as they need to know Semantic Web related technologies). To overcome that limitation, this demonstration paper presents Cultural Heritage Educational Semantic Tool (CHEST), a distributed application aimed at supporting teachers in authoring Cultural Heritage learning tasks based on existing Cultural Heritage Linked Open Data. Teacher annotations are published as Linked Open Data, thus facilitating the reuse of such data by other teachers (using CHEST or other applications). This new application also supports students in the completion of the learning tasks created and/or reused by their teachers. CHEST can be used by both teachers and students using a web-based desktop interface or Android/iOS mobile apps. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The preservation and innovation of traditional craftsmanship under industrialization pressures constitute critical challenges for cultural sustainability. Focusing on Chengdu lacquerware—a Chinese intangible cultural heritage facing multifaceted preservation dilemmas—this study develops a digital methodology for its systematic documentation and contemporary adaptation. Through computational analysis of 307 historical artifacts spanning four craftsmanship categories (carved silver mercer, carved lacquer hidden flower, carved filling, and broach needle carving), we established a three-phase digital preservation framework: (1) image preprocessing of 280 qualified samples using adaptive binarization and Canny edge detection for ornament extraction, (2) chromatic analysis via two-stage K-means clustering to decode traditional color schemes, and (3) creation of a digital repository encompassing color profiles and ornamental elements. The resource library facilitated three practical applications: modular recombination of high-frequency motifs, cross-media design adaptations, and interactive visualization of craftsmanship processes. Technical analysis confirmed that adaptive binarization effectively mitigated image noise compared to conventional methods, while secondary clustering enhanced color scheme representativeness. These advancements demonstrate that structured digital archiving coupled with computational analysis can reconcile traditional aesthetics with modern design requirements without compromising cultural authenticity. The workflow provides a transferable model for intangible heritage preservation, emphasizing rigorous documentation alongside adaptive reuse mechanisms. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - To facilitate discovery of premodern manuscripts in U.S. memory institutions, Digital Scriptorium, a growing consortium of over 35 institutional members representing American libraries, museums, and other cultural heritage institutions, has developed a digital platform for an online national union catalog. The platform will allow low-barrier and efficient collection, aggregation, and enrichment of member metadata and sustainably publish it as Linked Open Data. This article describes the methods and principles behind the data model development and the decision to use Wikibase. The results of the prototype implementation and testing phase demonstrate the practicality and sustainability of Digital Scriptorium's approach to building an online national union catalog based on Linked Open Data technologies and practices.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The NFDI (German National Research Data Infrastructure) consortia are associations of various institutions within a specific research field, which work together to develop common data infrastructures, guidelines, best practices and tools that conform to the principles of FAIR data [1, 2]. Within the NFDI, a common question is: What is the potential of Wikidata to be used as an application for science and research [3]? In this paper, we address this question by tracing current research use-cases and applications for Wikidata, its relation to standalone Wikibase instances [4], and how the two can function as complementary services to meet a range of research needs. This paper builds on lessons learned through the development of open data projects and software services within the Open Science Lab at TIB, Hannover, in the context of NFDI4Culture - the consortium including participants across the broad spectrum of the digital libraries, archives, and museums field, and the digital humanities [5, 6]. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Historical tourism documentation includes guidebooks, pamphlets, and digital resources, which are collections of materials that promote the exploration of historical sites, events, and cultural heritage. These materials aim to offer insights into the history and importance of particular locations, people, and items. Within these documents, nominal historical terminologies possess valuable information, serving as significant entities that can contribute to our understanding of history. This study introduces a method for knowledge graph (KG) generation through Thai co-occurrence network analysis, called ThaiCoGen. This work improves KG generation by using three important methods: (1) term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) to find important terms and entities; (2) Thai co-occurrence network text analysis (ThaiCoNet) to connect semantic relationships; and (3) adding to KGs using linked open data from encyclopedias. Our contributions are the generation of KGs using extracted high-n-gram entities and the highlighting of semantic enrichment. Our contributions include (1) generating KGs by identifying the extracted height n-gram entities and (2) highlighting semantic enrichment. A case study was conducted on the Thai encyclopedia LST.org in the domain of the Suvarnabhumi Silk Road and demonstrated the efficacy of the ThaiCoGen methodology. Despite the substantial temporal gap between historical records from the Suvarnabhumi Silk Road era (100-700 BE) and contemporary tourist documentation from the modern era (2500 BE), ThaiCoGen successfully integrates these sources into enriched KGs. The discussion of this paper intends to elaborate on the historically accurate portrayal of the Suvarnabhumi Silk Road from the enriched KG, especially Thailand's tourism industry. Finally, this research provides the open KGs for Thailand's cultural heritage in order to build the robustness of semantic application development.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Cultural heritage collections available as linked open data (LOD) may contain harmful stereotypes about people and cultures, for example, in outdated textual descriptions of objects. Galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM) have suggested various approaches to tackle potentially problematic content in digital collections. However, the domain expertise and discussions about words and phrases used in LOD-collections are scattered across different resources and detached from the collections themselves. In this paper, we capture domain expertise about English and Dutch contentious heritage terminology in a knowledge graph. Contentious terms in the resulting graph are then linked to entities from other LOD-resources used in the cultural domain and beyond, including Wikidata and WordNet. We make our design decisions explicit and report on the linking process. The developed knowledge graph makes expert knowledge interoperable, so it can be reused by the cultural heritage community and other LOD-developers to contribute to a more inclusive representation of cultural heritage on the Web. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The ROSSIO Infrastructure aims at aggregating, organising and contextualising digital objects whose metadata descriptions are provided by a consortium of Portuguese academic, public and private sector institutions in the domains of social sciences, arts and humanities. ROSSIO is the Portuguese representative of DARIAH, the European research infrastructure for arts and humanities. A platform is being developed to provide search and content curation services for researchers and the general public, namely digital collections, digital exhibitions and a virtual research environment. The ROSSIO Thesaurus is being developed to support content discovery and management in the platform. The thesaurus is being modelled as a SKOS concept scheme, and it leverages on existing unstructured vocabularies, such as subject headings and thesauri, produced by the ROSSIO data providers. This paper describes the modelling process of the ROSSIO Thesaurus, its integration and role in the infrastructure, its publication as Linked Open Data, and the results of this work after 6 months of development.

AB  - In recent years, cultural heritage institutions have been exploring the benefits of applying Linked Open Data to their catalogs and digital materials. Innovative and creative methods have emerged to publish and reuse digital contents to promote computational access, such as the concepts of Labs and Collections as Data. Data quality has become a requirement for researchers and training methods based on artificial intelligence and machine learning. This article explores how the quality of Linked Open Data made available by cultural heritage institutions can be automatically assessed. The results obtained can be useful for other institutions who wish to publish and assess their collections. © 2023 The Author.

AB  - The Locarno Film Festival (LFF) archives represent a valuable collection of cinematic history, providing essential resources for research, education, and the promotion of international film culture. To ensure these resources are easily accessible, it is crucial to develop advanced methods for managing and linking the information they contain. This work focuses on creating a shared way for organizing information, transforming the LFF archives into dynamic, interconnected resources. This transformation is essential for preserving cinematic heritage, improving discoverability, promoting digital transformation, and efficiently managing archives. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we developed the OntoFest following the Linked Open Terms (LOT) Methodology. Significant outcomes of this project include the successful reuse of existing ontologies to manage heterogeneous information, which has improved our ability to understand and retrieve relevant data. This work demonstrates the potential of digital archives in the cinematic field and provides a foundation for future initiatives in digitizing cinematic heritage archives. OntoFest not only contributes to preserving the cinematic cultural heritage of the LFF but also lays the groundwork for new research and creative applications in the digital transformation of film festival archives. © 2024 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - This work provides a proficient approach to coordinate archeological exercises, information administration, digital object representation, and spatial investigation. The proposed framework furnishes the client with the intuitive investigation of the 3D model artifacts along with detailed information on specific points of interest alongside their 3D geographic information system (3D GIS). A parallel result is the utilization of fully transparent and costeffective open-source tools and free software. The work addressed the creation of a computerized system that aids classification, administration, and representation of archeological discoveries inside a 3D web-based repository; and the utilization of 3D digital models as a restoration of the artifacts to allow navigation through the data; besides enabling 3D GIS to spatially store, share, envision and examine complex archeological components; This work is one of the first of its type in Qatar to archive and record all of the archeological data from the Murwab site in Qatar. © 2022.

AB  - The main mission of cultural memory institutions is to protect their collections and to provide access to a wider audience. World Wide Web technology offers different tools to fulfill this mission. Among a range of applications, the most effective is the search engines’ search for metadata of collections. However, search engines are not always able to see all sources caused by various problems. Linked data is a publishing technique that uses standard web technologies to associate data with other data and makes them available on the Web. In available literature, it is seen that many memory institutions use Linked Open Data as a solution to the search engine problem with the main motivation of making their collections more accessible. However, these applications are still not at proficient level. In this study, Linked Open Data studies in the available literature were scanned and a process map was created based on these applications. These applications, which especially require technical knowledge and infrastructure, can be confusing for memory institutions that have not yet participated in the process. In this context, it is clear that the process map created as a result of this study will be enlightening for memory institutions. The most important point on the map is that an extensive decision-making mechanism should be formed with the stakeholders before starting the process and the implementation plan should be developed in detail over the problems of existing projects. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper presents the proposed ontology for the project “Computational Approaches for Addressing Problematic Terminology” (CAAPT). This schema seeks to represent contents and structure of language guideline documents produced by cultural heritage institutions seeking to engage with critical cataloguing or reparative description work, known as terminology guidance documents. It takes the Victoria and Albert Museum Terminology Guidance Document as a source for the initial modelling work. Ultimately, CAAPT seeks to expand the knowledge graph beyond the context of the Victoria and Albert Museum to incorporate additional terminology guidance documents and linked open data vocabularies. The ontology seeks to bring together scholarly communities in areas relevant to this project, most notably those in cultural heritage and linguistics linked open data, by leveraging existing linked data resources in these areas: as such, OntoLex, CIDOC CRM, and SKOS are used as a foundation for this work, along with a proposed schema from a related project, CULCO. As the CAAPT project is in early stages, this paper presents the preliminary results of work undertaken thus far in order to seek feedback from the linguistics linked open data community. © 2024 ELRA Language Resource Association.

AB  - is article describes a recommender system (RS) in the cultural heritage area, which takes into account the activities on social media performed by the target user and her friends. For this purpose, the system exploits linked open data (LOD) as well. More specifically, the proposed RS (i) extracts information from social networks (e.g., Facebook) by analyzing content generated by users and those included in their social networks; (ii) performs disambiguation tasks through LOD tools; (iii) profiles the user as a social graph; (iv) provides the actual user with personalized suggestions of artistic and cultural resources by integrating collaborative €ltering algorithms with semantic technologies for leveraging LOD sources such as DBpedia and Europeana. © 2017 ACM.

AB  - Reflectance transformation imaging (RTI) is a computational photography technique widely used in the cultural heritage and material science domains to characterize relieved surfaces. It basically consists of capturing multiple images from a fixed viewpoint with varying lights. Handling the potentially huge amount of information stored in an RTI acquisition that consists typically of 50–100 RGB values per pixel, allowing data exchange, interactive visualization, and material analysis, is not easy. The solution used in practical applications consists of creating “relightable images” by approximating the pixel information with a function of the light direction, encoded with a small number of parameters. This encoding allows the estimation of images relighted from novel, arbitrary lights, with a quality that, however, is not always satisfactory. In this paper, we present NeuralRTI, a framework for pixel-based encoding and relighting of RTI data. Using a simple autoencoder architecture, we show that it is possible to obtain a highly compressed representation that better preserves the original information and provides increased quality of virtual images relighted from novel directions, especially in the case of challenging glossy materials. We also address the problem of validating the relight quality on different surfaces, proposing a specific benchmark, SynthRTI, including image collections synthetically created with physical-based rendering and featuring objects with different materials and geometric complexity. On this dataset and as well on a collection of real acquisitions performed on heterogeneous surfaces, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed relightable image encoding. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The National Library of Finland (NLF) agreed on an "Open National Library" policy in 2016[1]. In the policy there are eight principles, which are divided into accessibility, openness in actions and collaboration. Accessibility in the NLF means that access to the material needs to exist both for the metadata and the content, while respecting the rights of the rights holders. Openness in operations means that our actions and decision models are transparent and clear, and that the materials are accessible to the researchers and other users. These are one way in which the NLF can implement the findable, accessible, interoperable, re-usable (FAIR) data principles [2] themes in practise. The purpose of this paper is to view the way in which the policy has impacted our work and how findability and accessibility have been implemented in particular from the aspects of open, extended, closed and hidden data themes. In addition, our aim is to specify the characteristics of existing and potential forms of data produced by the NLF from the research and development perspectives. A continuous challenge is the availability of the digital resources - gaining access to the digitised material for both researchers and the general public, since there are also constant requests for access to newer materials outside the legal deposit libraries' work stations. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

AB  - While existing Linked Datasets provide detailed representations of Cultural Heritage objects, the locations where the objects originate from is often not accurately represented. Countries, municipalities, and excavation sites are commonly represented by geospatial points, and the fact that countries and municipalities change their geometry over time is not reflected in the data. We present nlGis, a collection of existing geo-historic datasets that are now published as Linked Open Data. The datasets in nlGis contain detailed geographic information about historic regions, with an emphasis on the Netherlands. We describe the creation of this Linked Geodataset and how it can be used to enrich Cultural Heritage data. We also distill several ‘lessons learned’ that can guide future attempts at publishing detailed Linked Geodata in the Cultural Heritage domain. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The paper outlines how the modern information technologies can be used for the preservation and the popularisation of historically and culturally significant Roman sites from the lower part of the Danube Limes, a UNESCO World Heritage site candidate. This specific geographical zone was selected due to the many well preserved, but fairly unknown sites along the lower part of the Danube River and on the border area between Bulgaria and Romania. All results, which are presented in this paper, are obtained during the implementation of the ongoing project 15.2.1.038 Ancient roman cultural heritage interactive visualization environment for the cross border area between Bulgaria and Romania (ARCHIVE), co-financed by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund under the INTERREG V-A Romania-Bulgaria Programme.In the initial sections of the paper we briefly present the international consortium and the structure of the project, its aim and main objectives. The next sections of the paper are focused on the activities for the preservation and popularization of the ancient Roman sites. These activities range from the traditional ground-based photo and video shootings of the selected Roman locations to the use of the modern unmanned aerial vehicles for obtaining low and high altitude photographs, video clips, as well as for the creation of ortho-photo images and 3D models. The paper investigates also the use of 3D scanners and photo cameras for the digitalization and the creation of 3D models of some of the most significant Roman artefacts and the printing of these 3D models as scaled replicas using modern eco-friendly 3D printers. The next section of the paper investigates the possibilities for the use of the created digital materials - for the development of tourist applications for mobile devices, for the creation of electronic educational resources about the Roman history in the cross-border area between Bulgaria and Romania, for the creation of Virtual museums and so on. Last, but not least, we present some topics from the created joint strategy for popularisation of the Roman heritage, which focus on the use of the developed resources for the training and education of the local school and university students. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - An archaeological site is a palimpsest in which the evidence of the depositional episodes is destroyed through the excavation processes; all that remains are the artefacts and their documentary evidence manifested in registers, datasets, dig diaries and reports. While the reports may represent the end product of a specific excavation, the archaeological record tells a story; it is interpretative and dynamic, with later excavations adding new knowledge and narratives. Museums preserve the artefacts but unless the documentary evidence is preserved in standard formats, it cannot be easily re-used by the archaeology community to create that knowledge; nor can museums provide the narratives for the general public whose cultural heritage it is. This article presents a case study from the Ness of Brodgar excavations that examines possibilities for reconciling one part of the data of an archaeological dig, the small finds register (SFR) and its sparse amount of descriptive metadata, with the potentiality of data re-use and with the requirements of a museum that may have custody of the artefacts. It maps and enriches messy domain-specific ontologies to standard archaeological and cultural heritage ontologies and taxonomies using simple natural language processing, linked open data and the museum CIDOC conceptual reference model (CRM). This research, in examining the application of ontology mapping tools, explores common practices and processes that are useful in any discipline within the cultural heritage domain. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Although iDocs are a newer genre of non-fiction IDNs, there are few studies reporting results on their impact and the user experience. A common goal of iDocs is to engage the pubic in social, economic and environmental issues. This investigation applied the iDoc genre to cultural heritage to create a prototype for user testing titled Sentenced to Transportation: A Virtual Tour of Australia’s Convict Past. The user testing completed in this study analysed three key variables: the level of perceived agency based on the narrative structure, choices provided in the interface design, and ability to persuade further user participation. The results show that users can be persuaded through the narrative design to proceed non-linearly and to engage in further user participation post-interaction. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - There is a growing interest in the world of Open Data, with many initiatives in the Cultural Heritage field. Platforms like Europeana, archive.org, Open Heritage by Google are only few examples of on-line catalogues full of open artefacts published with various formats. It is a new and promising way to engage public, such as, students, citizens, non-profit organisations. This paper faces the question of how to help audience in reusing Open 3D models and other artefacts available on Open Cultural Heritage repositories. The idea is to provide a Social Platform named SPOD where citizens can visualise artefacts, share and comment with others in a social way to increase understanding, awareness and engagement in cultural heritage. The foundation is the Datalet-Ecosystem Provider (DEEP), an open source, extensible, scalable, and Edge-centric visualisation architecture to support reuse of visualisations of Open Data in Cultural Heritage. It consists of reusable, dynamic and interactive visualizations named datalets. It includes a variety of visualisations, charts, geographical maps and 3D visualisations. Datalets can be generated and embedded in any web-page as well. SPOD exploits the DEEP architecture to support users within the platform in generating visualisations of Open artefacts, reuse and share them within discussions. © 2018 GCH 2018 - Eurographics Workshop on Graphics and Cultural Heritage.

AB  - After decades of digitization, large cultural heritage collections have emerged on the web, which contain massive stocks of content from galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. This increase in digital cultural heritage data promises new modes of analysis and increased levels of access for academic scholars and casual users alike. Going beyond the standard representations of search-centric and grid-based interfaces, a multitude of approaches has recently started to enable visual access to cultural collections, and to explore them as complex and comprehensive information spaces by the means of interactive visualizations. In contrast to conventional web interfaces, we witness a widening spectrum of innovative visualization types specially designed for rich collections from the cultural heritage sector. This new class of information visualizations gives rise to a notable diversity of interaction and representation techniques while lending currency and urgency to a discussion about principles such as serendipity, generosity, and criticality in connection with visualization design. With this survey, we review information visualization approaches to digital cultural heritage collections and reflect on the state of the art in techniques and design choices. We contextualize our survey with humanist perspectives on the field and point out opportunities for future research. © 1995-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Obtaining 3D realistic models of urban scenes from accurate range data is nowadays an important research topic, with applications in a variety of fields ranging from Cultural Heritage and digital 3D archiving to monitoring of public works. Processing massive point clouds acquired from laser scanners involves a number of challenges, from data management to noise removal, model compression and interactive visualization and inspection. In this paper, we present a new methodology for the reconstruction of 3D scenes from massive point clouds coming from range lidar sensors. Our proposal includes a panorama-based compact reconstruction where colors and normals are estimated robustly through an error-aware algorithm that takes into account the variance of expected errors in depth measurements. Our representation supports efficient, GPU-based visualization with advanced lighting effects. We discuss the proposed algorithms in a practical application on urban and historical preservation, described by a massive point cloud of 3.5 billion points. We show that we can achieve compression rates higher than 97% with good visual quality during interactive inspections. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Knowledge management plays a crucial role in initiatives that promotes the discovery and sharing of cultural and heritage informational resources from diverse and autonomous organizations and initiatives. Information in this domain is heterogeneous, distributed, multi-lingual, comes in unstructured formats and large quantities, is strongly contextualized by time and place is created collaboratively. These challenges can be undertaken using semantic technologies. Semantic Web approach and Linked Data technologies are a catalyst for cross-domain and cross-organizational semantic data interoperability and data integration. In this regard, this work will look at the interaction between knowledge management and linked open data within the context of cultural and heritage data with a particular focus on the concept of music data. This work will discuss, among other things, how Semantic Knowledge Graphs based on linked data can contribute to enhancing knowledge management and increase productivity, in actions related with cultural data enrichment, data exploration, knowledge discovery, cultural data reuse, and data visualization. By representing information using data models and open semantic standards, data integration and reasoning can be applied to the cultural data in a well-defined way. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The ongoing EU funded INCEPTION project proposes a significant improvement in the 3D modelling for the enhancement of Cultural Heritage knowledge by the use of a BIM approach for the semantic enrichment and management of models. Indeed, when used in the CH field, semantic BIM will be able to connect different users (e.g. scholars, technicians, citizens, governments), supporting the need for interpretation of the cultural heritage model. The expectations on this are quite broad, but the architectural differences make the task quite difficult. Since every building is the final result of different influences and combinations in order to solve practical problems, as well as further additions and changes during time, the INCEPTION project is developing common parameters, setting a nomenclature or “glossary of names” as a starting point to semantic enrichment and modelling in BIM environment. One of the main issues in creating a nomenclature is that there are many different active sources that all have very valuable information that would be interesting to be reused. Furthermore, this means both valuable but potentially competing information needs to be connected. Semantic Web technology and Linked Open Data principles make it possible to define an open H-BIM ontology. This state-of-the-art technology is developed by members of the W3C organization and is at the moment, a mature technology. INCEPTION makes use of the tools available, supporting these standards. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

It includes collections of objects (or resources) of a very different nature: paintings, photos, pianos, autograph scores, manuscript leaves, books preserved in the Museum’s library, etc. In order to make the Belliniano Museum’s heritage interoperable and reusable by scholars and cultural operators, we propose to semantically organize it in a unique homogeneous container, the OntoBellini ontology, designed and developed according to the Linked Open Data and Semantic Web paradigms. The wide variety of the involved museum resources, not even fully digitalised and catalogued, led us to the idea of experimenting with the RDA (Resource Description and Access) standard for creating library and cultural heritage resource metadata. In this paper we describe the ongoing work towards the realization of the OntoBellini ontology. Copyright © 2019 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Wikidata is evolving as the hub of Linked Open Data (LOD), with its language-neutral URIs and close adherence to Wikipedia. Well defined URIs help the data to be interoperable and linkable. This paper examines the possibilities of utilizing Wikidata as the means of a vocabulary resource for promoting the use of linkable concepts. Digital curation projects are vibrant with varying demands and purposes, which makes them less suitable for adopting any common vocabularies or ontologies. Also, developing and maintaining custom vocabularies are expensive processes for smaller projects in terms of resources and skill requirements. In general, Wikidata entities are well documented with Wikipedia entries, and Wikipedia entries express the conceptual and hierarchical relations in detail with provisions to modify or create. The authors explain the concept of using Wikidata as a vocabulary source with a proof of concept module implementation for Omeka-S, a widely adapted open source digital curation platform. This paper is expected to show some practical insights on reliable an reasonable vocabulary development for social informatics as well as cultural heritage projects, with a notion to improve the quality and quantity of linkable data from digital curation projects. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Cultural heritage is the way of life. Using digital technology to manage the information of cultural heritage has become an important issue on the perseverance of cultural heritage. Several cultural heritage institutions have their own large databases with different metadata schemas. Linked Open Data is a mechanism of publishing structured data that allows metadata to be connected. This paper presents a methodology for integrating, converting Lanna cultural heritage metadata and linking data to external data sources. Our framework uses OAI-PMH (Open Archives Initiative—Protocol for Metadata Harvesting) by converting the various metadata formats to Dublin Core metadata standard. The Dublin Core/XML was used for the integrated metadata to create a central repository of data sources. The OAI harvester was developed to extract data from the various repositories and gather data into the repository. A framework for publishing the repository data as a Linked Data source in the RDF format using the OAM Framework is described. In this framework, ontology is used as a common schema for publishing the RDF data from the database sources by mapping database schema to ontology. Finally, we demonstrate Linked Data consumption by creating a cultural heritage portal application prototype from the published RDF data sources. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

AB  - This paper describes the ontology model and published datasets of a digitized biographical person register. The applied ontology model is designed to represent people via their enduring roles and perduring lifetime events. The model is designed to support 1) prosopographical Digital Humanities research, 2) linking to resources in semantic Cultural Heritage portals, and 3) semantic data validation and enrichment by using SPARQL queries. The linked data approach enables to enrich a person's biography by interlinking it with space and time related biographical events, persons relating by social contacts or family relations, historical events, and personal achievements.

AB  - Describing cultural heritage objects from the perspective of Linked Open Data (LOD) is not a trivial task. The process often requires not only choosing pertinent ontologies but also developing new models that preserve the most information and express the semantic power of cultural heritage data. Indeed, data managed in archives, libraries, and museums are complex objects themselves, which require a deep reflection on even nonconventional conceptual models. Starting from these considerations, this article describes a research project: to expose the vastness of one of the most important collections of European cultural heritage, the Zeri Photo Archive, as LOD. We describe here the steps we undertook to this end. First, we developed two ad hoc ontologies for describing all issues not completely covered by existent models (the F Entry and the OA Entry Ontology). Then we mapped into RDF the descriptive elements used in the current Zeri Photo Archive catalog, converting into CIDOC CRM and into the two new aforementioned models the source data based on the Italian content standards Scheda F (photography entry, in English) and Scheda OA (work of art entry, in English). Finally, we created an RDF dataset of the output of the mapping that could show a result capable of demonstrating the complexity of our scenario. © 2017 ACM.

AB  - The existence of numerous and rich traditional music collections, their importance for preserving cultural heritage and an increasing interest in this type of music were the key factors leading to the concept of a music research support environment for ethnomusicologists. Our experience with Polish traditional music collections and archives shows that their existence is not equivalent to their availability for search, retrieval, processing and analysis. The idea behind the environment is to provide stable infrastructure and software solutions necessary to enable musicological research and, in a wider perspective, to open traditional music resources for a larger group of users. The paper describes our motivation for building such music research support environment and a number of issues and challenges we have encountered in the process. We present the environment concept, building stages already completed and plans for its further development. The environment is founded on the dLibra digital library adapted to the requirements of traditional music content and collections and with consideration for the current needs of ethnomusicologists. It combines the advantages of a user-centric layered digital library and Linked Open Data enrichment with system-centric music processing tools. A few of such tools have already been developed, for example, to support automatic music transcription of a large number of recordings in order to make them available for research and analysis. Future development plans include content aggregation and content-based indexing and search. © 2020. ACM ISBN.

AB  - Technology could sensitize end-users to preservation of cultural heritage while stimulating more interest based on a greater involvement. Our approach to this goal is based on a novel gamification and story-telling based on scientific foundations. At the same time, this application can offer the pro-user an interactive visualization suitable to study and verify new theories about the artifacts both on their current state and on its 3D reconstruction, but, at the same time, design a workflow capable to integrate different optimization techniques to adjust data depending on different scenarios. This leads to a unified system able to adapt itself to external requirements in a semi-automatic fashion. Finally, new ways of playful interaction, based on simple mathematical operations, were investigated.

AB  - The cultural heritage artifacts that have been collected in national museums serve as important resources for learning, and contribute to the country’s development. In this work, we present TOMS (Thailand Open Museum System), a semantic-based application designed to enable collaboration and the sharing of a wide range of information among national museums. This is accomplished by using linked open data (LOD) and an ontology model based on accepted museum ontology standards from the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC CRM). The system is composed of the following three layers: (1) Data Store Layer for maintaining each museum’s database including digital 3D content and standard metadata descriptions, represented in a standard distributed data format; (2) Data Manipulation and Processing Layer for handling data processing and query execution; and (3) System Interface Layer designed for each particular site, to exchange and integrate data with other sites in the network via an LOD SPARQL endpoint. The system operations have been demonstrated through case studies and an evaluation, showing that they are highly effective and useful for both national museums and museum users. © 2019, Ohmsha, Ltd. and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This article is a preliminary report on the work of the Canadian Linked Data Initiative (CLDI), a collaboration between five of Canada’s largest research libraries, Library and Archives Canada, Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec, and Canadiana.org. Although still in its nascent stage, participating institutions are working together to advance the technical services divisions of our libraries in the area of linked data. Project working groups are making progress in five main areas: grant funding, digital collections, education and training, legacy metadata enhancement, and in the evaluation and adaptation of Bibliographic Framework Transition Initiative tools. By working across geographic and institutional boundaries, the CLDI aims to chart a path to a new age of technical services, one based on the foundation of Linked Open Data. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC © Marlene van Ballegooie, Juliya Borie and Andrew Senior.

The Levels of Conceptual Interoperability Model (LCIM) is a progressive model developed by Dr. Andreas Tolk within the field of Modeling and Simulation and systems engineering to be used in determining potential for interoperability between systems. This paper applies the LCIM through a descriptive model to a digital library ecosystem that includes digital collections, digital libraries, and meta-aggregators. This paper seeks to determine if this model is sufficient as a method of measuring the potential for interoperation between systems, metadata, and collections within a digital cultural heritage ecosystem. A maturity model for interoperability within a digital library ecosystem can aid metadata operations specialists in determining the potential for interoperability between systems and collections.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to describe insights gained from a collaboration project between RISE, an experimental research institute, and Borås Museum, a local cultural heritage institution, around the topic of how technology can be used in museums to encourage social interaction between visitors and between visitors and the museum staff. This is investigated through a case study of “Anyone Can Innovate!”, a multi-participatory game-like VR-installation, using a perspective of participatory design. The study was conducted through observations by the developers, formal user testing with externally recruited testers, and by an interview with the responsible project leader and curator from Borås Museum. The VR-installation was tested in two iterations with different levels of embedded guidance, and included different roles for the participants, as an attempt to boost collaboration and interaction. One conclusion of the study is that the use of technology in a museum doesn't per se mean that it will be participatory, and that it does not necessarily exclude the role of a human guide. In the discussion part, examples are given on how technology can be used as a tool to use participatory design. © 2021 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - In this paper, we describe our research activities for integrating the recommendation process of nearby points of artistic and cultural interest (POIs) with related multimedia content. The recommendation engine exploits the potential offered by linked open data (LOD), by following semantic links in the LOD graph to identify movies, books, and music artists/songs related to that specific POI. This content is subsequently reranked based on the activity of the user and her friends on social media (i.e., Facebook), in order to provide personalized suggestions. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Storytelling in museum environments can be ‘materialized’ using print and visual media formats. The use of graphical visualization techniques improves the interpretation in a narrative context, hence helps to convey information and deliver a better understanding of a story. This research was prompted by the rising use of interactive visualization techniques for ‘storytelling’ in museum environments.

AB  - Three-dimensional content offers a powerful medium enabling rich, interactive visualization in virtual and augmented reality systems, which are increasingly used in a variety of application domains, such as education, training, tourism and cultural heritage. The creation of interactive 3D presentations is typically a complex process covering diverse aspects of the content such as geometry, structure, space, appearance, animation and behavior. Recent trends in the development of the semantic web provide new opportunities for simplifying 3D content creation, which may be performed at different levels of abstraction and may encompass the inference of hidden knowledge, which may influence the created content. However, the available approaches to 3D content creation do not enable conceptual knowledge-based modeling of 3D content. The main contribution of this paper is an approach to semantic creation of 3D content. The proposed solution leverages the semantic web techniques to enable conceptual, knowledge-driven content creation. The proposed approach has been implemented and evaluated. It has been shown that the approach can significantly simplify modeling of advanced 3D content presentations in comparison with the available approaches. © 2014, The Author(s).

AB  - This paper propose a metadata schema to preserve the semantics of cultural heritage (CH) objects. A widely used standard of CH metadata is already provide by CIDOC-CRM which has been approved as an ISO 21127 in 2006. However, mapping CH attributes to CIDOC-CRM entities needs to be done carefully since the metadata could be published as open data. In order to enrich the spatial information of CH objects, we linked the metadata with geographic features in open geographic dataset Geonames. In the experiment results, the metadata and open linked data seems to be successfully implemented and can be used to solve more specific query about CH objects relates to their spatio-temporal relationships. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Cultural heritage institutions have recently started to explore the added value of sharing their data, opening to initiatives that are using the Linked Open Data cloud to integrate and enrich metadata of their cultural heritage collections. However, each museum and each collection shows peculiarities, which make it difficult to generalize this process and offer one-size-fits-all solutions. In this paper, we report on the integration, enrichment and interlinking activities of metadata from a small collection of verbo-visual artworks in the context of the Verbo-Visual-Virtual project. We investigate how to exploit Semantic Web technologies and languages combined with natural language processing methods to transform and boost the access to documents providing cultural information, i.e., artist descriptions, collection notices, information about technique. We also discuss the open challenges raised by working with a small collection including little-known artists and information gaps, for which additional data can be hardly retrieved from the Web. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Through a design study, we develop an approach to data exploration that utilizes elastic visualizations designed to support varying degrees of detail and abstraction. Examining the notions of scalability and elasticity in interactive visualizations, we introduce a visualization of personal reading traces such as marginalia or markings inside the reference library of German realist author Theodor Fontane. To explore such a rich and extensive collection, meaningful visual forms of abstraction and detail are as important as the transitions between those states. Following a growing research interest in the role of fluid interactivity and animations between views, we are particularly interested in the potential of carefully designed transitions and consistent representations across scales. The resulting prototype addresses humanistic research questions about the interplay of distant and close reading with visualization research on continuous navigation along several granularity levels, using scrolling as one of the main interaction mechanisms. In addition to presenting the design process and resulting prototype, we present findings from a qualitative evaluation of the tool, which suggest that bridging between distant and close views can enhance exploration, but that transitions between views need to be crafted very carefully to facilitate comprehension. © 2020 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum © 2020 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The application projects the museum object upon the archaeological site and its original location, bringing the landscape into the museum experience. We outline technical challenges encountered and solutions adopted. Since this is a work in progress, further user testing remains to evaluate our approach and the app. © Copyright 2020 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - This paper presents the vision and longstanding work in Finland on creating a national Cultural Heritage ontology infrastructure and semantic portals based on Linked Data on the Semantic Web. In particular, the “Sampo” series of semantic portals is considered, including CultureSampo (2009), TravelSampo (2011), BookSampo (2011), WarSampo (2015), BiographySampo (2018), NameSampo (2019), WarWictimSampo (2019), FindSampo (2019), MMM (2020), LawSampo (2020), AcademySampo (2020), and ParliamentSampo (2022). They all share the “Sampo model” for publishing Cultural Heritage content the Semantic Web that typically involves three components: 1) A “business model” for harmonizing, aggregating, and publishing heterogeneous, distributed contents based on a shared ontology infrastructure. 2) An approach to interface design, where the data can be re-used and accessed independently from multiple application perspectives, while the data resides in a single SPARQL endpoint. 3) A two-step model for accessing and analyzing the data where the focus of interest is first filtered o ut u sing f aceted s emantic s earch, a nd t hen v isualized o r a nalyzed by ready-to-use Digital Humanities tools of the portal. This model has been proven useful in practise: Sampo portals have attracted lots users from tens of thousands to millions depending on the Sampo. It is argued that the next step ahead could be portals for serendipitous knowledge discovery where the tools, based on AI techniques, are able to find automatically serendipitous, “interesting” phenomena and research questions in the data, and even solve problems with explanations.

AB  - Several semantic web approaches tackle the problem of integrating multidisciplinary rich content using Linked Open Data. Cultural heritage (CH) is a multidisciplinary domain that contains a massive heterogeneous content that varies distinctly by types and properties. Various semantic web approaches have been proposed in the context of CH, and at multiple integration levels (local, national, international). These approaches focus on metadata schemata integration but give no significant importance to the representation of a tangible cultural heritage object, as a whole entity, and the different parts that compose it. Targeting the goal of the preservation and restoration of CH artifacts, we aim at modeling the CH content focusing on the composition of a CH object. We thus illustrate here an approach of using a part-whole and spatial relations to model the composition of a tangible object in general, and a CH object in particular. To do this, we introduce parthood concepts and properties for representing the composition mechanism, and 7 cases of parthood/spatial relations in tangible objects, with their corresponding logical/ontological relation(s). We implement our approach using OWL2 as the ontological language for our linked open data approach. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The analysis of Cultural Heritage (CH) artefacts is an important task in the Digital Humanities. Increasingly, rich CH artefact data comprising metadata of different modalities becomes available in digital libraries and research data repositories. However, the large amounts and heterogeneity of artefacts in these repositories compromise their accessibility for common domain analysis tasks, as domain researchers lack a structural overview of the spatial, temporal, and categorical traits of the artefacts in these collections. Still, researchers need to compare artefacts along different modalities, put them into context, and deal with possible uncertainties, subjectivities, or missing data. To date, many works support domain research via interactive visualisation. The majority relies primarily on visualisation of text and metadata including spatiotemporal, image and shape data. However, fewer consider these types of data in a tightly coupled way. We present an approach for tightly integrated multimodal visual exploration of large CH data collections along space, time and shape traits. Based on requirements obtained in collaboration with domain researchers, we introduce a set of interlinked views for exploration of said modalities. An appropriately defined approach automatically computes most significant correlations across different modalities, guiding the user towards detecting interesting artefact relationships. We apply our approach to pertinent archaeological data collections, and demonstrate that characteristic explorative tasks are effectively supported and domain-relevant artefact relations can be discovered. © 2020 The Author(s) Eurographics Proceedings © 2020 The Eurographics Association.

AB  - In this article, we describe a hybrid recommender system (RS) in the artistic and cultural heritage area, which takes into account the activities on social media performed by the target user and her friends, and takes advantage of linked open data (LOD) sources. Concretely, the proposed RS (1) extracts information from Facebook by analyzing content generated by users and their friends; (2) performs disambiguation tasks through LOD tools; (3) profiles the active user as a social graph; (4) provides her with personalized suggestions of artistic and cultural resources in the surroundings of the user’s current location. The last point is performed by integrating collaborative filtering algorithms with semantic technologies in order to leverage LOD sources such as DBpedia and Europeana. Based on the recommended points of cultural interest, the proposed system is also able to suggest to the active user itineraries among them, which meet her preferences and needs and are sensitive to her physical and social contexts as well. Experimental results on real users showed the effectiveness of the different modules of the proposed recommender. © Springer Nature B.V. 2019.

AB  - Video games have a short but rich history. Therefore, they have been gaining popularity as cultural heritage and research material. Several studies have analyzed the metadata and cataloging of video games. However, the research on its implementation is limited. Hence, we investigate the practice of cataloging video games at the Center for Game Studies, Ritsumeikan University (RCGS) in this study and examine the effectiveness of data utilization from Wikidata to construct an authority of works for video games. We accomplished this by associating the distribution package with Wikipedia and Wikidata. Consequently, records of works covering approximately half of the video games were created. However, the problem of uniformity of granularity and completeness was found in these data based on Wikipedia's culture and policies. Thus, data enrichment is difficult owing to the non-uniform granularity of bibliography with Wikidata. In contrast, the cost of data creation is effective. Furthermore, the external link ID is highly effective in enhancing the value of catalog as Linked Open Data (LOD). It is also evident that using published authority data is useful for data integration but Wikidata has some problems with its features. There is a need to consider the function and purpose of the catalog as linked data instead of a separate catalog. Thus, the adaptation of Wikidata for catalogs needs to be designed accordingly as linked data. © 2019 Dublin Core metadata initiative. All rights reserved.

AB  - Visualization as a means to generate hypotheses and to communicate insights on digitized cultural heritage data sets has become more and more important in the recent years. While many digital humanities researchers transform their data in order to be processed with ready-to-use tools, others engage in interdisciplinary collaborations with visualization scholars aiming to design novel solutions and interactive visual interfaces as occurring data features are more carefully mapped to visual attributes. Many of those collaborations suffer from loss of time at the beginning of the project as scholars with diverse research backgrounds require to understand each others' mindsets, ways of thinking and research interests. This paper reports on three years of teaching visualization design for digital humanities projects. It provides an overview of theoretical course contents, practical training, collaboration setups-involving computer science, digital humanities as well as humanities students who experienced typical collaboration obstacles-and remarkable project results.

AB  - Over the last decades 3D modelling has been a fast growing field in Geographic Information Science, extensively applied in various domains including reconstruction and visualization of cultural heritage, especially monuments and traditional settlements. Technological advances in computer graphics, allow for modelling of complex 3D objects achieving high precision and accuracy. Procedural modelling is an effective tool and a relatively novel method, based on algorithmic modelling concept. It is utilized for the generation of accurate 3D models and composite facade textures from sets of rules which are called Computer Generated Architecture grammars (CGA grammars), defining the objects' detailed geometry, rather than altering or editing the model manually. In this paper, procedural modelling tools have been exploited to generate the 3D model of a traditional settlement in the region of Central Zagori in Greece. The detailed geometries of 3D models derived from the application of shape grammars on selected footprints, and the process resulted in a final 3D model, optimally describing the built environment of Central Zagori, in three levels of Detail (LoD). The final 3D scene was exported and published as 3D web-scene which can be viewed with 3D CityEngine viewer, giving a walkthrough the whole model, same as in virtual reality or game environments. This research work addresses issues regarding textures' precision, LoD for 3D objects and interactive visualization within one 3D scene, as well as the effectiveness of large scale modelling, along with the benefits and drawbacks that derive from procedural modelling techniques in the field of cultural heritage and more specifically on 3D modelling of traditional settlements.

AB  - This paper presents the in-use AcademySampo portal and Linked Open Data (LOD) service for biographical and prosopographical research, a new member in the Sampo series of cultural heritage applications for Digital Humanities. The portal is based on a dataset of short textual biographies about all 28 000 Finnish and Swedish academic people educated in 1640 1899 in Finland. Linked data extracted from the biography entries was enriched by internal and external data linking, and by reasoning, e.g., genealogical networks of the people mentioned. The data was published as a LOD service. This paper demonstrates how to use the AcademySampo data in Digital Humanities research by faceted search integrated seamlessly with data analytic tools of the AcademySampo portal, as well as by using the LOD service directly via a SPARQL editor and by Python scripting using Google Colab and Jupyter notebooks. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

AB  - Intangible cultural heritage (ICH) contains rich knowledge, and the effective organization and management of ICH knowledge is the foundation for the protection and inheritance of ICH. The development of semantic Web technology changes the way of knowledge representation and expression and provides new ideas and methods for the organizing and sharing of ICH knowledge. This paper describes a research project: to model and manage the ICH knowledge by publishing the knowledge as linked data. Firstly, a knowledge ontology was designed to reveal and standardize the concept, attribute and relationship of ICH knowledge elements. Then, we converted the knowledge to RDF data basted on the knowledge ontology and linked the entities with DBpedia and GeoNames. Finally, taking the ICH in Hubei province as an example, the methodology was used to create an RDF dataset which published as linked open data, and develop a knowledge service platform based on the linked data service. The research has promoted the standardization of knowledge management of ICH in China, which is of great significance for the protection and dissemination of ICH.

AB  - The major aim of this paper is to present a non-destructive GIS-based method for a frescoes and Icon analysis pat of the cultural heritage. The proposed methodology is based on the combination of topographic surveys, digital photogrammetry and image processing techniques by means of four control points and one photography of the target at least, that become metric rectified image at any plane defined by the user. It is possible to quantify any physical characteristic of the surface of a frescoe as well as alterations on its surface that produce deviations from flatness. The Bundle adjustment was applied to a 2D reconstruction algorithm instead to a 3D reconstruction algorithm to control frescoe, from the Ramet Monastery. There are many reasons and motives for digital modelling of real world objects, including: virtual reconstruction of historical artifacts icons and frescoes that no longer or only partially exist, digital documentation of pictures for restoration purposes in case of fire, flood, etc.; ability for virtual interaction without the risk of damage; production of e-learning data for educational resources; virtual tourism; virtual museum exhibits; and interactive visualisation of the objects. © 2018 Scibulcom Ltd.

AB  - As more and more cultural institutions publish their data using the web-of-data semantic level, there is a need for novel applications for exploring, analyzing, mining and visualizing such data. A first step for these applications is to be able to query the linked open data. In this paper we survey the different existing systems for this purpose, providing examples from our experiences in the Cultural Heritage domain, and discussing some possible mutual enrichment between some of them. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - With the advent in advanced computing methodologies and forward-thinking data storage needs over the last decade, there has been a major drive for reformatting archival collections to enable advanced computational analysis. In this paper, we present our digital compendium of music from the Arab Mashriq and Western Indian Ocean comprising two music collections drawn from Library materials and field recordings at the New York University Abu Dhabi. This is at once the product and object of our ongoing research at the intersection of cultural heritage preservation and computational analysis. Through computational-ethnomusicological research, we explore the cross-cultural similarities, interactions, and patterns from the music excerpts in order to understand their similarity space by employing audio analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques. Besides the digital artifactual value, pedagogical/educational and scholarly outcomes, we focus on attracting user-friendly and community engagement into appreciating the music from this region. This is done by providing interactive visualizations of the musical features on a dashboard application and 3-D rendering of the mappings in a VR environment. The VR experience is not only immersive but also provides a scope for appreciation, learning, and dissemination of the music from the region. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The Netwerk Digitaal Erfgoed is a Dutch partnership that focuses on improving the visibility, usability and sustainability of digital collections in the cultural heritage sector. The vision is to improve the usability of the data by surmounting the borders between the separate collections of the cultural heritage institutions. Key concepts in this vision are the alignment of the data by using shared descriptions (e.g. thesauri), and the publication of the data as Linked Open Data. This demo paper describes a Proof of Concept to test this vision. It uses a register, where only summaries of datasets are stored, instead of all the data. Based on these summaries, a portal can query the register to find what data sources might be of interest, and then query the data directly from the relevant data sources.

AB  - Digitization of cultural heritage artefacts is now common. Creation of 3D models by various techniques is widespread. However, most spatial (3D) objects are still represented by photographs in portals such as Europeana. There is a significant potential of using 3D models for education, research, scientific collaboration and popularization. We describe a web-based application that allows scalable visualizations of 3D models ranging from mobile devices to large LCD walls in classrooms and laboratories. Synchronized simultaneous access over a network enables distance learning and collaboration using such models. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.

AB  - Art historical photo archives that want to expose their data in Linked Open Data need to rely on shareable models. Merging possibly contradictory information may affect data reliability. In this paper are introduced two ontologies, i.e. F Entry Ontology and OA Entry Ontology, which provide a complete description of items related to Photography and Arts domains and address the description of questionable information provided by different institutions. A preliminary analysis of the Zeri’s photo archive was performed for guiding the creation of the ontologies and the mapping of all the partners’ metadata schemas. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - The current trends in society evolution are showing rapid changes in our habitual environments and consequently affecting human interactions with them. Among the key factors of this process we can certainly cite the growth of BigData favored by the knowledge digitalization, the dissemination of sensors in environments and the advancements of connectivity capabilities. At the same time, the progress in artificial intelligence and cognitive robotics has lead to the production of sophisticated humanoid robots, which are progressively spreading to a wide public. In this way, research efforts are needed for a proper knowledge management and knowledge acquisition by machines, in order to have more natural and friendly human-robot interactions in daily tasks, usually performed by human beings. In this paper we show an approach related to a human-robot interaction in cultural heritage context, simulating a digital ecosystem where a robot plays the role of a guide for tourists and it is able to proactively interact with its interlocutors by combining both semantic and visual information. The proposed approach, its implementation and experimental results on a real robotic platform are shown and discussed.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Point cloud is widely used in various applications like 3D geographical information system (GIS), cultural heritage preservation, urban planning, etc. Most of these applications require interactive visualization of massive point cloud, which is challenging since their sizes are usually very large. This paper presents a method to construct a hierarchical data structure for point cloud data organization and real-time rendering, with an emphasis on speeding up the construction processing. The overall pipeline consists of the following three steps: first, the spatial extent of the whole dataset is divided into nested blocks; second, data in each block is reorganized using a octree based on random subsampling in a parallel fashion; finally, octree of all blocks are merged into a consistent hierarchy. The effectiveness and efficiency of the above approach was demonstrated by applying it to a set of point clouds of varying sizes reconstructed using photogrammetry pipeline. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Digitisation has become a common practice in the preservation of museum collections. Recent development of photogrammetry techniques allows for more accessible acquisition of three-dimensional (3D) models that serve as accurate representations of their originals. One of the potential applications of this is presenting digital collections as virtual museums to engage the public. Medical museums, particularly, would benefit from digitisation of their collections as many of them are closed to the public. The aim of this project was to design and create an interactive virtual museum which would represent the Anatomy Museum at the University of Glasgow with key specimens digitised using photogrammetry techniques. Members of the general public (25 participants) were asked to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of the interactive application by completing questionnaires. A process to digitise anatomical specimens using photogrammetry and convert them into game-ready 3D models was developed. The results demonstrated successful generation of 3D models of specimens preserved using different techniques, including specimens preserved in fluid and glass jars. User tests and evaluation of the application by members of the general public were positive, with participants agreeing that they would now consider visiting the real museum after using the virtual version. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Cultural heritage (CH) resources are very diverse, heterogeneous, discontinuous and subject to possible updates and revisions in nature. The use of semantic web technologies associated with 3D graphical tools is proposed to improve the access, the exploration, the mining and the enrichment of this CH data in a standardized and more structured form. This paper presents a new ontology-based tool that allows to visualize spatial clustering over 3D distribution of CH artifacts. The data that we are processing consists of the archaeological shipwreck”Xlendi, Malta”, which was collected by photogrammtry and modeled by the Arpenteur ontology. Following semantic web best practices, the produced CH dataset was published as linked open data (LOD). © 2018 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Development and virtual representation of 3D models of Cultural Heritage (CH) objects has triggered great interest over the past decade. The main reason for this is the rapid development in the fields of photogrammetry and remote sensing, laser scanning, and computer vision. The advantages of using 3D models for restoration, preservation, and documentation of valuable historical and architectural objects have been numerously demonstrated by scientists in the field. Moreover, 3D model visualization in virtual reality has been recognized as an efficient, fast, and easy way of representing a variety of objects worldwide for present-day users, who have stringent requirements and high expectations. However, the main focus of recent research is the visual, geometric, and textural characteristics of a single concrete object, while integration of large numbers of models with additional information-such as historical overview, detailed description, and location-are missing. Such integrated information can be beneficial, not only for tourism but also for accurate documentation. For that reason, we demonstrate in this paper an integration of high-resolution spherical panoramas, a variety of maps, GNSS, sound, video, and text information for representation of numerous cultural heritage objects. These are then displayed in a web-based portal with an intuitive interface. The users have the opportunity to choose freely from the provided information, and decide for themselves what is interesting to visit. Based on the created web application, we provide suggestions and guidelines for similar studies. We selected objects, which are located in Bulgaria-a country with thousands of years of history and cultural heritage dating back to ancient civilizations. The methods used in this research are applicable for any type of spherical or cylindrical images and can be easily followed and applied in various domains. After a visual and metric assessment of the panoramas and the evaluation of the web-portal, we conclude that this novel approach is a very effective, fast, informative, and accurate way to present, disseminate, and document cultural heritage objects. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Historical documentary heritage has a high potential for supporting citizens' awareness of their culture and identity. However, to exploit this potential, access tools are needed, which integrate data from heterogeneous sources and provide an effective user interaction. Moreover, historical archives can become a useful and attractive cultural resource, if they are exploited in popular contexts, such as education and tourism: Innovative ICT-based applications can employ documents, pictures, etc. to guide students and tourists in the discovery of interesting stories, connecting the present to the past, and providing a larger audience with a live access to original cultural heritage resources. In particular, we claim that this scenario can be enabled by providing ICT tools with a rich semantic layer, based on computational ontologies, in which the notions of event and role play a major role. Such a semantic layer can be further enriched by exploiting resources available in the Linked Open Data cloud. © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many projects have already analyzed the current limitations and challenges on the integration of the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud in mobile augmented reality (MAR) applications for cultural heritage, and underline the future directions and capabilities. The majority of the above works relies on the detected geo-location of the user or his device by various sensors (GPS - global positioning system, accelerometer, camera, etc.) or geo-based linked data, while others use marker-based techniques to link various locations with labels and descriptions of specific geodata. But when it comes to indoor environments (museums, libraries) where tracking the accurate user’s position and orientation is challenging due to the lack of GPS valid sensor data, complex and costly technological systems need to be implemented for identifying user’s OoI (Object of Interest). This paper describes a concept which is based on image identification and matching between frames from the user’s camera and stored images from the Europeana platform, that can link the LOD cloud from cultural institutes around Europe and mobile augmented reality applications in cultural heritage without the need of the accurate user’s location, and discusses the challenges and future directions of this approach. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - The emergence of Semantic Web and LOD - Linked Open Data - technologies enable that digital objects representing the holdings of archives, libraries and museums collections be semantically interlinked throughout the Web. What are the different types of cultural relevant relationships that may exists between digital objects of collections in archives, libraries and museums throughout the Web? How discover, organize and formalize these relationships to be used by curators in LOD applications? A methodology to analyze the holdings of archives, libraries and museums is proposed based on onomasiologic perspective. Such methodology is applied to a hypothetical competency question that might be proposed by a digital curator. Results indicated that conceptual models such as FRBR, CIDOC CRM and EDM may provide a rich repertoire of semantic relationships that may be used in LOD applications to interlink collections in heritage institutions. © 2016 International Society for Knowledge Organization.

AB  - This paper presents a multimedia tool suite for, on the one hand, the annotation of metadata that encode the dramatic qualities of cultural heritage items, and, on the other, the visualization of such metadata for drama analysis and didactics. The tool suite relies upon an ontology of drama to devise an annotation schema for the metadata concerning the dramatic qualities. The two major modules of the tool suite are a web-based platform, that allows for the insertion of the annotation metadata, and a visualization program for the interactive exploration of such metadata, respectively. The tool suite was tested on the cross-media studies of drama analysis and teaching of drama structure through the application to classical examples. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

AB  - Nowadays, there are rapid developments in the fields of photogrammetry, laser scanning, computer vision and robotics, together aiming to provide highly accurate 3D data that is useful for various applications. In recent years, various LiDAR and image-based techniques have been investigated for 3D modelling because of their opportunities for fast and accurate model generation. For cultural heritage preservation and the representation of objects that are important for tourism and their interactive visualization, 3D models are highly effective and intuitive for present-day users who have stringent requirements and high expectations. Depending on the complexity of the objects for the specific case, various technological methods can be applied. The selected objects in this particular research are located in Bulgaria - A country with thousands of years of history and cultural heritage dating back to ancient civilizations. \this motivates the preservation, visualisation and recreation of undoubtedly valuable historical and architectural objects and places, which has always been a serious challenge for specialists in the field of cultural heritage. In the present research, comparative analyses regarding principles and technological processes needed for 3D modelling and visualization are presented. The recent problems, efforts and developments in interactive representation of precious objects and places in Bulgaria are presented. Three technologies based on real projects are described: (1) image-based modelling using a non-metric hand-held camera; (2) 3D visualization based on spherical panoramic images; (3) and 3D geometric and photorealistic modelling based on architectural CAD drawings. Their suitability for web-based visualization are demonstrated and compared. Moreover the possibilities for integration with additional information such as interactive maps, satellite imagery, sound, video and specific information for the objects are described. This comparative study discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these three approaches and their integration in multiple domains, such as web-based 3D city modelling, tourism and architectural 3D visualization. It was concluded that image-based modelling and panoramic visualisation are simple, fast and effective techniques suitable for simultaneous virtual representation of many objects. However, additional measurements or CAD information will be beneficial for obtaining higher accuracy.

AB  - Recent advances in contemporary Virtual Reality (VR) technologies are going to have a significant impact on veryday life. Through VR it is possible to virtually explore a computer-generated environment as a different reality, and to immerse oneself into the past or in a virtual museum without leaving the current real-life situation. For such the ultimate VR experience, the user should only see the virtual world. Currently, the user must wear a VR headset which fits around the head and over the eyes to visually separate themselves from the physical world. Via the headset images are fed to the eyes through two small lenses. Cultural heritage monuments are ideally suited both for thorough multi-dimensional geometric documentation and for realistic interactive visualisation in immersive VR applications. Additionally, the game industry offers tools for interactive visualisation of objects to motivate users to virtually visit objects and places. In this paper the generation of a virtual 3D model of the Selimiye mosque in the city of Edirne, Turkey and its processing for data integration into the game engine Unity is presented. The project has been carried out as a co-operation between BIMTAS, a company of the Greater Municipality of Istanbul, Turkey and the Photogrammetry & Laser Scanning Lab of the HafenCity University Hamburg, Germany to demonstrate an immersive and interactive visualisation using the new VR system HTC Vive. The workflow from data acquisition to VR visualisation, including the necessary programming for navigation, is described. Furthermore, the possible use (including simultaneous multiple users environments) of such a VR visualisation for a CH monument is discussed in this contribution.

AB  - Faceted search is a well known and broadly implemented paradigm for filtering information with various types of structured information. In this paper we introduce a multiple-view faceted interface, consisting of one main visualisation for exploring the data and multiple miniaturised visualisations showing the filters. The Recommendation Dashboard tool provides several interactive visualisations for analysing recommender results along various faceted dimensions specific to cultural heritage and scientific content. As our aim is to reduce the user load and optimise the use of screen area, we permit only one main visualisation to be visible at a time, and introduce the concept of micro-visualisations - small, simplified views conveying only the necessary information - to provide natural, easy to understand representation of the the active filter set. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - This paper focuses on issues surrounding the rich content of the Getty vocabularies, [1] particularly as they have transitioned from more traditional data releases to become optimized for release as LOD and beyond. The Getty vocabularies have been a mainstay of cataloging, indexing, and access for art, architecture, and other cultural heritage information since the 1980s. They are compiled resources that grow through contributions from the expert user community. They are multicultural and multilingual, currently being translated in several languages. With the release of the AAT (Art Architecture Thesaurus®), ULAN (Union List of Artist Names ®), and TGN (Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names®) as Linked Open Data (LOD), [2] the Getty vocabularies are entering a new world of seemingly limitless possibilities in digital scholarship. With the addition of new resources, CONA (Cultural Objects Name Authority®) and the Getty Iconography Authority (IA), the Getty vocabularies are poised to truly become linchpins in joining disparate resources from diverse disciplines, including art museums, special collections, libraries, archives, conservation, archaeology, visual resources, universities, and other researchers. The Getty vocabularies may serve as conduits through which data about art, architecture, and other cultural heritage are created and accessed for research and discovery. From their inception, the Getty vocabularies were designed to be linkable to each other and to the broader realm of cultural heritage information. For example, in the AAT, concepts are linked to each other through hierarchical and associative relationships with defined relationship types that inform the user that a rhyta (http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300198841) is a type of ancient drinking vessel having an animal shape and is distinguished from vessels in other cultures having a similar purpose or appearance, such as stirrup cups and sturzbechers. In ULAN, the record for a person such as Katsushika Hokusai (http://vocab.getty.edu/page/ulan/500060426) may include various go names and aliases, and links to records for his teachers, family, and a novelist with whom he collaborated. In TGN, a geographic place record for Siena (http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/7011179) may include ancient names, as well as links to multiple broader hierarchical contexts, for the modern nation of Italy as well as the ancient confederation of states, Etruria. In the IA, an Aztec character Ometecuhtli (http://vocab.getty.edu/page/ia/901002056) may be linked to named legends in which he is a character, as well as to other characters or places to which he is related. In CONA, titles/names and other information for works of art, including architecture, movable works (paintings, sculptures, textiles), and conceptual works (multiples) are linked to AAT, ULAN, TGN, IA and external sources, linking rich information from multiple sources to describe works whether extant, destroyed, or designed but never built. An example is the Old Trikuta temple (http://vocab.getty.edu/page/cona/700002003). © 2018 Pacific Neighborhood Consortium (PNC).

AB  - Digital 3D models and their visualizations are increasingly being used in many fields of research, engineering design and humanities. They enable people to see objects in perspectives not available in 2D images. It would be useful if a group of people in a classroom, laboratory or across distances can collaboratively discuss their observations drawn using 3D models. We describe a simple system that allows a group of people to share in real-time their views of a 3D model using their devices ranging from mobile phones to large video walls. We evaluated the system performance and usability with 3D models of digitized cultural heritage objects. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - This paper propose a method for automatically linking spatial information that embedded in cultural heritage metadata to geo linked open data. The spatial information that embedded in a cultural heritage object could be used to enrich information of the other objects. For example, by knowing the spatial relation between two or more CH objects, we could conclude the condition of civilization in the past. Since most of the spatial information might had been documented incompletely, it needs to utilize open geo datasets as a dictionary to identify any place names and its other related information that would be beneficial to enrich CH metadata. However, linking spatial information to geo linked open data could be very troublesome if it done manually. For the experimental purposes, we built a prototype to test the feasibility of our method. As the result, our method are considered could give contribution in generating CH metadata along with their enriched spatial information. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Both, historical as well as contemporary images depicting particular aspects of a certain culture, or a certain cultural practice, are widely available in a variety of formats. Typically, historical-cultural images can be found in museums, national archives and libraries both in analogue and digital formats. The Europeana image collection serves as a valuable example of a digital image collection available to the public, that is freely accessible and searchable. A significant amount of the collection, however, does not contain a rich semantic description of the cultural and social aspects represented in the images that would go beyond some metadata like author and title. To enable the enrichment of these images, we propose a project which brings together experts from digital humanities, linguistics, artificial intelligence and semantic web technology. The project aims at analysing the contents of the images with a combination of computer vision, natural language processing and manual curation to represent them with a more descriptive and representative controlled vocabulary. This combination of different types of expertise to address the problem enables us to closely collaborate and learn from each other by taking different roles and perspectives. So far, the collaboration has contributed to the understanding of the detailed requirements from the digital humanities and socio-linguistic perspectives for the representation and processing of cultural images using semantic web technologies, such as multi-disciplinary thesauri, ontologies, computer vision and AI. © 2020 CEUR-WS.

AB  - This article presents VISE, an interface that enables VIsual Search and Exploration across collections of approximately 836, 000 museum objects extracted from the websites of the National Museums Scotland and the Rijksmuseum in the Netherlands. VISE provides an interactive visual summary of information relating to the museum to address online users with no domain knowledge challenges of exploring large museum collection. User satisfaction evaluation was conducted to measure the user satisfaction level for using VISE as the interface for search and exploration of information from large museum collection when compared to non-visual search interface. The evaluation of the visual interface revealed that users are more satisfied and attracted to explore museum objects via VISE than via the system with no visual search interface. Users with little or no domain knowledge find it easier to explore collections and find objects of interest while using VISE in contrast to the system with no visual interface. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - This paper presents the linked data representation of the National Library of Latvia (NLL) authority data consisting of topical, geographic name and form/genre thesauri. It is an important step from a data silo (MARC 21 data) to linked open datasets, represented using SKOS, that can be reused both within and outside the library domain. The datasets are converted to SKOS using mc2skos and are published as linked data using the Skosmos application for publishing SKOS datasets. The paper describes the datasets, including information about their external links. The NLL topical terms dataset, in particular, contains many external links – 85% of its concepts have links to the Library of Congress subject headings dataset that is available as linked open data. The published datasets can be applied to interconnecting Latvia’s cultural heritage information by describing museum and archive items with URIs from these datasets. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Cultural heritage institutions such as archives, libraries, and museums have the mission of curating and safeguarding societal memories. The patrimonialization and curatorial processes developed by such institutions are continuous value-adding activities. Such institutions are beginning to publish their collections as digital objects on the Web. The representation and publication of cultural heritage records as digital objects using LOD—linked open data—technologies is a new step in patrimonialization and curatorial practices. Many collections are thematically superimposed, complementary, and have synergy. These collections often present culturally relevant relationships between their objects, like a book about a painting or a draft or sketch of a famous painting, etc. This research aims at characterizing such culturally relevant relationships, compiling an inventory, and organizing them in a vocabulary. The implementation of semantic links using LOD technologies can achieve interoperability between digital collections and improve the usability of digital collections, thus empowering heritage institutions. © 2018 International Society for Knowledge Organization.

AB  - This paper describes the research and design of three tangible and embodied prototypes that aim to enable users to meaningfully engage with an artifact's historical context and use. Together, these prototypes engage users in a cultural heritage experience that is sensorially embodied through a 'multimodal' ensemble of visual, aural, tactile, and olfactory interactions. A preliminary user test suggests that future work on multisensory interaction should focus on developing accessible design principles and considerations that support a sensorially embodied and tangible understanding of historical artifacts. We suggest that multisensory interactions present significant opportunities for interactive exhibits to expand our access to cultural history and its artifacts. © 2016 ACM.

AB  - Cultural heritage institutions have recently started to explore the added value of sharing their data, using Linked Open Data to integrate and enrich metadata of their collections. The catalogue of the Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes contains about 200,000 records which were transformed to RDF triples employing basically the RDA vocabulary (Resource Description and Access) to describe the entities. However, further refinements are needed for the recognition and extraction of implicit relationships expressed in natural language, such as geographic locations and dates. In order to facilitate literature researchers in carrying out sophisticated location-based searches, a web-based prototype is proposed. The usability of this web interface were evaluated in a user-based study, the results of which are also reported. The methods applied for the automation of the enrichment process, which build upon open-source software components, are described here. © 2017 ACM.

AB  - In recente years many cultural heritage institutions such as archives, libraries, and museums are publishing their collection as digital objects over the Web. Since ever such institutions have the mission of the curation and safeguarding of the memories of societies. The patrimonialization and curatorial processes developed by heritage institutions are continuous value-adding processes based on consolidated methodologies. The representation and publication of cultural heritage records as digital objects using LOD-Linked Open Data-technologies are new steps in this patrimonialization and curatorial processes. Many collections are thematically superimposed, complementary, and have synergy. Frequently these collections present culturally relevant relationships between their objects, like a book about a painting or a draft or sketch of a famous painting, etc. This research aims at characterizing such culturally relevant relationships, compiling an inventory, and organizing them in a vocabulary. The implementation of culturally relevant relationships as semantic links using LOD technologies can achieve interoperability between digital collections and improve their usability. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

AB  - There exist many digital collections of cultural and historical resources, referred to as digital archives in this paper. Domains of digital archives are expanding from traditional cultural heritage objects to new areas such as popular culture and intangible entities. Though it is known that metadata models and authority records, such as subject vocabularies, are essential in building digital archives, they are not yet well established in these new domains. Another crucial issue is semantic linking among resources within a digital archive and across digital archives. Metadata aggregation is an essential aspect for the resource linking. This paper overviews three metadata-centric on-going research projects by the authors and discusses some lessons learned from them. The subject domains of these research projects are disaster records of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, Japanese popular culture such as Manga, Anime and Games, and cultural heritage resources in South and Southeast Asia. The main goal of this paper is not to report on these projects as completed research, but to discuss issues of metadata models and aggregation which are important in organizing digital archives in the web-based information environment. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

AB  - Recent advances in contemporary Virtual Reality (VR) technologies are going to have a significant impact on everyday life. Through VR it is possible to virtually explore a computer-generated environment as a different reality, and to immerse oneself into the past or in other virtual environments without leaving the current real-life situation. Cultural heritage (CH) monuments are ideally suited both for thorough multi-dimensional geometric documentation and for realistic interactive visualisation in immersive VR applications. Furthermore, VR is increasingly in use for virtual locations to enhance a visitor’s experience by providing access to additional materials for review and deepening knowledge either before or after the real visit. Using today’s available 3D technologies a virtual place is no longer just a presentation of geometric environments on the Internet or a virtual tour of the place using panoramic photography. Additionally, the game industry offers tools for interactive visualisation of objects to motivate users to virtually visit objects and places. This paper presents the generation of virtual 3D models for different cultural heritage monuments and their processing for data integration into the two game engines Unity and Unreal. The workflow from data acquisition to VR visualisation using the VR system HTC Vive, including the necessary programming for navigation and interactions, is described. Furthermore, the use (including simultaneous use of multiple end-users) of such a VR visualisation for CH monuments is discussed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - Interactive visualization of spatio-temporal data is a very active area that has experienced remarkable advances in the last decade. This is due to the emergence of fields of research such as big data and advances in hardware that allow better analysis of information. This article describes the methodology followed and the design of an open source tool, which in addition to interactively visualizing spatio-temporal data that are represented in an ontology, allows the definition of what to visualize and how to do it. The tool allows selecting, filtering and visualizing in a graphical way the entities of the ontology with spatiotemporal data, as well as the instances related to them. The graphical elements used to display the information are specified on the same ontology, extending the VISO graphic ontology, used for mapping concepts to graphic objects with RDFS/OWL Visualization Language (RVL). This extension contemplates the data visualization on rich real-time 3D environments, allowing different modes of visualization according to the level of detail of the scene, while also emphasizing the treatment of spatio-temporal data, very often used in cultural heritage models. This visualization tool involves simple visualization scenarios and high interaction environments that allow complex comparative analysis. It combines traditional solutions, like hypercube or time-animation with innovative data selection methods. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - This article is a proof-of-concept case study to evaluate the functionality of a block metaphor–based linked data generator. In this work, we chose to produce linked data repository of recipes, which provide a medium for people to share their regional and healthy recipes with the masses. However, the same approach can also be adapted easily to other domains. Therefore, the applicability of our approach extends well beyond the food domain that we are considering in this article. As a medium for information sharing and understanding between heterogeneous systems, ontologies will play an important role in the realisation of the Internet of things (IoT) vision. Therefore, an ontology-based recipe repository would also be one of the basic blocks of a smart kitchen environment. However, building ontologies is a challenging task, especially for users who are not conversant in the ontology building languages. This article proposes an approach that can be used even by non-experts and facilitates the sharing and searching of recipe data. In our case, we exploit the features of the block paradigm to publish recipes in Linked Data format. In this way, users do not have to know the OWL (Web Ontology Language) syntax and the text input is kept minimal. As far as we know, this article is the first study that produces linked data using Blockly in the literature. We also conducted a user-based evaluation of the proposed approach using the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Cultural heritage institutions store and manage large volumes of historical information, that have great material and humanitarian value. Their means of data organization, often obsolete, hinders the dissemination and reuse of information to be made in an effective way. In this sense, an application of Linked Open Data (LOD) technology is the possibility to extend the knowledge of a collection, with the use of open data already consolidated on the web to describe artworks or any type of physical object. This paper introduces a generic architecture based on an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) methodology that connects LOD data from cultural heritage available on the web, generates descriptive content for physical objects and provides the mapping of research institutes engaged in studying them, highlighting their collaboration network. For instance, an implementation of the architecture was dedicated to the domain of Botany and can assist herbarium managers in creating exhibitions about medicinal plants. In this paper, we present a software architecture that provides an automatic method for creating dynamic pages from data stored in interconnected databases, and an application, which supports visitation systems with visualization and interaction mechanisms to encourage visitor learning. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Nowadays, the development of information technology both in terms of hardware and software has been growing rapidly. Many people used technology to search many types of information. On the other hand, there are information on Sundanese ancient manuscript as cultural heritage with many valuable information still accessed manually, such as the manuscript which located in Situs Kabuyutan Ciburuy, Garut, Jawa Barat. Many people with many purposes (i.e. Research, education, etc.) came to access directly. Its becoming a problem because due to lack of maintainability, the manuscripts became fragile. Furthermore, the information will be lost. So, the emergency solution should be proposed to preserve this valuable heritage. We proposed a retrieval system using the probability approach that can be effective for search the information in ancient Sundanese language. The two probability approaches: Bayesian Networks and Divergence form Randomness have been compared. The 50 queries for three different types of structured query have been run and evaluated by Mean Average Precision (MAP). The results give that the effective methods come from Bayesian Network. There is another finding during the building process of retrieval system. The interactive visualization can be delivered by the retrieval system according to the given query. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - The World Wide Web is one of the main ways of accessing knowledge in cultural heritage. Recently, several projects in digital humanities have emerged; however only a few are specialized in musicology. In this paper, we present MusicKG, a multilingual knowledge graph about medieval musicology and musical iconography. A specific ontology has been designed to integrate data from several iconographic and musicology databases. In addition, MusicKG is connected to the Linked Open Data cloud with a significant part of its classes, properties and instances being linked to Wikidata, Getty Vocabularies, MIMO, Iconclass and GeoNames. MusicKG is accessible and reusable by three means: a downloadable RDF dump, a Virtuoso faceted browser and a public SPARQL endpoint. Some representative SPARQL query examples are given to illustrate the scope of MusicKG and to show the potential impact on the research work in medieval musicology. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - ModRef is a project from the laboratory Labex "Les passés dans le présent", which coordinates various projects on digital humanities. ModRef focuses more precisely on the semantic web and linked open data. The goal is to move heterogeneous data into triplestores also called data warehouses or collections of RDF files in order to improve the sharing, exchange and discovery of new knowledge. For this purpose, the CIDOC-CRM norm has been chosen since it is, at present, the reference for the semantic description of museographic or cultural heritage data. In order to realise the proof of concept of ModRef, a general architecture has been defined, a semantic modelling and data mapping of selected sub-projects of ModRef have been proposed, triplestores have also been created. A web application has been implemented and deployed. This web application describes the ModRef project, as well as it enables visualising, querying and exploring created triplestores. © 2017 INFORSID. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many public services and entertainment industries utilise Mixed Reality (MR) devices to develop highly immersive and interactive applications. However, recent advancements in MR processing has prompted the tourist and events industry to invest and develop commercial applications. The museum environment provides an accessible platform for MR guidance systems by taking advantage of the ergonomic freedom of spatial holographical Head-mounted Displays (HMD). The application of MR systems in museums can enhance the typical visitor experience by amalgamating historical interactive visualisations simultaneously with related physical artefacts and displays. Current approaches in MR guidance research primarily focus on visitor engagement with specific content. This paper describes the design and development of a novel museum guidance system based on the immersion and presence theory. This approach examines the influence of interactivity, spatial mobility, and perceptual awareness of individuals within MR environments. The developmental framework of a prototype MR tour guide program named MuseumEye incorporates the sociological needs, behavioural patterns, and accessibility of the user. This study aims to create an alternative tour guidance system to enhance customer experience and reduce the number of human tour guides in museums. The data gathering procedure examines the functionality of the MuseumEye application in conjunction with pre-existing pharaonic exhibits in a museum environment. This methodology includes a qualitative questionnaire sampling 102 random visitors to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Results of this research study indicate a high rate of positive responses to the MR tour guide system, and the functionality of AR HMD in a museum environment. This outcome reinforces the suitability of the touring system to increase visitor experience in museums, galleries and cultural heritage sites. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A large number of cultural heritage archives are freely available on the web: they can be in Linked Open data format, or in any other format, such as databases, collections or archives, with some information for each object. To be really enjoyed and enjoyable by the users on the web, a set of scored keywords need to be associated with each item, manually or automatically. The overall problem here addressed is the automatic, unsupervised extraction of keywords/keyphrases from the items of cultural heritage archives, in different languages (English and Italian). The problem is very actual and in literature many papers are devoted to this topic and several approaches have been defined: we present here a work-in-progress, an experimentation done with the aim of automatically associating scored keywords/keyphrases to a painting archive. We have therefore tested five different methods present in literature, such as tf-idf, RAKE, TextRank, ..., on two datasets, in English and in Italian, and evaluated the results - using recall and precision@n as the evaluation metrics. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The documentation of the archaeological heritage through 3D models to know ancient findings, has become a common practice within the international panorama. Using minimal hardware, as well as its ease of use in almost every environmental condition, make 3D sampling solutions based on Multiple View Stereo (MVS) matching and Structure from Motion techniques ideal for on-site documentation of excavations or emergencies. Moreover, the availability of inexpensive platforms for web-based visualization represents great benefit in the field of archaeology, where generally the low budged and the limitation of more complex instruments are a must. The case study presented in these pages, experienced in Petra, Jordan, moves towards this direction. In the close proximity of the El-Khasneh façade, is situated an excavation where two entrance, well preserved, give access to the Tomb of Pharaoh. The documentation described in these pages has the twofold objective of providing the research community with a priceless dataset, acquired for one of the most important heritage of the world that is partially still unknown and to share on line these computations. This work confirms how cultural heritage documentation and dissemination of architectural rests, that are important for tourism and their interactive visualization, can strongly benefit from the creation of 3D models and their sharing on the web. This particular archaeological setting is an interesting base for investigation, given the complexity of the structure and its precarious condition.

AB  - Empirical and Traditional knowledge is part of the concept of intangible cultural heritage, which represents immaterial cultural heritage items such as facts, stories, and traditions that are part of local culture. However, this knowledge might be lost over time. Encouraging public participation to record empirical knowledge is a way to preserve the culture of a region and make it known to others. This paper presents a web system that aims to record and to preserve empirical knowledge data. To achieve this goal, the tool uses three combined approaches: (i) crowdsourcing calls oriented to content creation by visitors; (ii) collaborative curation among experts for selection, evaluation, and publication of content; and (iii) interconnection between user contributions and data already available in open repositories on the web (in LOD format). The tool was applied in the Botany domain to curate empirical and cultural data about medicinal plants, where experts from the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden evaluated it. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Cultural Heritage Information (CHI) is scattered among memory institutions, and connecting them together is an important issue for their continued discovery, access, and use. This study proposes a generalized model named Cultural Heritage in Digital Environments (CHDE), which enables the organizing of both tangible and intangible cultural heritage in heterogeneous information environments. The model collects all related digital resources into one instance, which can be later digested into a single digital archive on the networked environment, based on the One-to-One Principle of Metadata. We specially focus on organizing intangible cultural heritage through their instantiations. The proposed model is mapped to renowned cultural heritage models to identify the component entities and to clarify their strengths and the weaknesses. We use South and Southeast Asian cultural heritage information to evaluate the suitability of this model, which is a novel approach in the region. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - In this paper we present our work on the design and evaluation of a web-based digital archive. The aim of this research project was to explore ways of enabling easy access to materials about their cultural heritage for indigenous people. In this project we worked in close collaboration with the Sami people across brainstorming sessions, design workshops, prototype development, and user tests. During this process we became aware of two intertwined sensitivities, i.e. a cultural sensitivity and a design sensitivity - and we refer to this as a "double sensitivity". The data recorded from the interviews and the participants' interaction with the prototype were analyzed using thematic analysis as the methodological approach. Our results pointed at five main code clusters including: tonality of the design, usability, sociability, ethical considerations and technical errors. In this paper we discuss these findings, and we suggest that our results, and the proposed notion of "double sensitivity" contributes important research on human computer interaction (HCI) design for indigenous people. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Cultural heritage sites, apart from being the tangible link to a country’s history and culture, actively contribute to the national economy, offering a foundation upon which cultural tourism can develop. This importance at the cultural and economic level, advocates for the need for preservation of cultural heritage sites for the future generations. To this end, advanced monitoring systems harnessing the power of sensors are deployed near the sites to collect data which can fuel systems and processes aimed at protection and preservation. In this paper we present the use of acoustic sensors for safeguarding cultural sites located in rural or urban areas, based on a novel data flow framework. We developed and deployed Wireless Acoustic Sensors Networks that record audio signals, which are transferred to a modular cloud platform to be processed using an efficient deep learning algorithm (f1-score: 0.838) to identify audio sources of interest for each site, taking into account the materials the assets are made of. The extracted information is presented exploiting the designed STORM Audio Signal ontology and then fused with spatiotemporal information using semantic rules. The results of this work give valuable insight to the cultural experts and are publicly available using the Linked Open Data format. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Multi-light, single-camera imaging techniques like Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI, including PTM, HSH, and PCA-RBF) and the Portable Light Dome (PLD) have been used by cultural heritage scholars and collection curators extensively because of the extra interactive visual information that can be revealed on artefacts when compared to standard digital photography. Besides a virtual relighting of the scanned object, these techniques offer filters to accentuate different aspects of the studied surface. The main focus of RTI, developed at HP, CHI and among others elaborated by ISTI CNR, is aimed at photo-realistic virtual relighting. PLD, developed at KU Leuven, on the other hand, is aimed at extracting surface properties such as surface color (albedo), surface gradient (normals), 3D surface features (height profiles) and reflectance distribution (reflectance maps). PLD and RTI both produce interactive pixel based file formats, which are dissimilar, resulting in incompatible datasets. The pixel+ project (Art and History Museum, KU Leuven, and KBR, Belspo BRAIN-be funded) aims to merge both technologies into one web-based consultation platform, allowing existing PLD and RTI datasets to be viewed in one web environment with their respective viewing filters as well as to illuminate the virtual model. Moreover, as both methods are alike in terms of required input and processed output, pixel+ focuses on other types of integration, resulting in new viewing modes for processed data as well as a novel reprocessing pipeline for existing source images. In addition, for sustainable and flexible web consultation a new open format, based on glTF, is suggested and a first elaboration is presented. © 2020 SPIE

AB  - In the process of translating cultural heritage data into linked open data, in particular from multiple sources, heterogeneity of data is a crucial issue. In this paper, our aim is to demonstrate the interest of linked open data and more precisely the IFLA LRM model for the digital representation of Quebec literature, based on data from various perspectives: authors, publishers, and books. We propose an IFLA LRM knowledge base to represent the aggregated data from these heterogeneous sources. We also extend the IFLA LRM model to take into account important aspects including literary awards, a more detailed description of authors, and book series, as well as interoperability with schema.org. Finally, we evaluate the resulting knowledge base using competency questions obtained from our data providers and show the benefit of data integration. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - While existing Linked Datasets provide detailed representations of Cultural Heritage objects, the locations where the objects originate from is often not accurately represented. Countries, municipalities, and excavation sites are commonly represented by geospatial points, and the fact that countries and municipalities change their geometry over time is not reflected in the data. We present nlGis, a collection of existing geo-historic datasets that are now published as Linked Open Data. The datasets in nlGis contain detailed geographic information about historic regions, with an emphasis on the Netherlands. We describe the creation of this Linked Geodataset and how it can be used to enrich Cultural Heritage data. We also distill several 'lessons learned' that can guide future attempts at publishing detailed Linked Geodata in the Cultural Heritage domain. © 2018 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

AB  - CIDOC CRM is an ontology intended to facilitate the integration, mediation and interchange of heterogeneous cultural heritage information. The Semantic Web with its Linked Open Data cloud enables scholars and cultural institutions to publish their data in RDF, using CIDOC CRM as an interlingua that enables a semantically consistent re-interpretation of their data. Nowadays more and more projects have done the task of mapping legacy datasets to CIDOC CRM, and successful Extract-Transform-Load data-integration processes have been performed in this way. A next step is enabling people and applications to actually dynamically explore autonomous datasets using the semantic mediation offered by CIDOC CRM. This is the purpose of OpenArchaeo, a tool for querying archaeological datasets on the LOD cloud. We present its main features: the principles behind its user friendly query interface and its SPARQL Endpoint for programs, together with its overall architecture designed to be extendable and scalable, for handling transparent interconnections with evolving distributed sources while achieving good efficiency. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

AB  - Augmented reality has seen an increased popularity among the last decades due to technological advances and, a consequent growth of the amount of augmented reality systems, became available. However, in order to diffuse this technology successfully, understand users’ feelings when using augmented reality applications is considered a major issue. This study implemented this technology in a cultural heritage outdoor context and tested it in-situ to evaluate user’s perspective regarding to personal satisfaction – including cultural enrichment acquired –, ease of use and their intention to use it. The results obtained, through questionnaires, presented the visitors acceptance regarding the usage of this type of solutions among a cultural heritage context, since it may become future visits more pleasant and desirable. The user’s majority expressed the request to use this technology more often in cultural heritage spaces. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - This paper focuses on the semantic annotation of textual content and on annotation requirements that emerge from the needs of cultural heritage annotation projects. The requirements presented here are based on two text annotation case studies at the National Library of Latvia and were generalised to be applicable to a wider range of annotation projects. This paper describes the requirements collected and how they may be implemented in practical applications. We propose a model for representing annotation data and implementing annotation systems. In particular, the model introduces a separate entity database that maintains information about the entities referenced from annotations and can point to additional information about these entities such as Linked Open Data resources. The result of this work is the annotation model and a collection of requirements that can be applied in different configurations depending on particular use cases and can provide a basis for developing and improving annotation tools.

AB  - Based on cultural heritage plays about throwing action, we made a public interactive artwork by throwing pseudo-balls, “deBallution.” Audience members participated in interactive artwork not only for pleasure but also as part of their cultural heritage, maintaining and also disrupting social orders and structures. First of all, this research extracted the audience’s basic activities from cultural archetypes. Then, it applied audience activities to a basic model of public interactive artwork for playing on a media façade to participating in collective performance for disruptive social structures. The interactive artwork concept is to catch audience members’ throwing movements on a virtual screen and drawing various generated kaleidoscope images to predict points from the audience throwing on the screen. We made prototype “deBallution” and then exhibited it and evaluated user tests. Through evaluation results for the prototype, we revised “deBallution” artwork contents for developing artistic values and produced overall interactive artwork. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - A vocabulary of culturally relevant relationships – CRR - between cultural heritage objects in Library, Archive, and Museum (LAM) was proposed with the aim of interlinking digital collections using the Linked Open Data (LOD) technologies. The CRR vocabulary was proposed to be used by culture curators, teachers, historians, etc. to enable them to interlink such digital resources to provide a richer context and to reveal new senses of such resources. This paper aims at testing and evaluating the CRR vocabulary, as follows. Wikipedia articles about remarkable cultural heritage objects as the painting Mona Lisa and the book Dom Casmurro are used to create RDF triples where the heritage object is the subject, relationships of the CRR vocabulary are the predicates, and links found in each Wikipedia article to other LAM digital objects, or other Web resources are the objects of each triple. The RDF graphs thus generated are presented and discussed. The necessity of improvements in the proposed CRR vocabulary is outlined and suggestions of these changes are proposed. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The work presented in this paper is engaging with and contributes to the implementation and evaluation of Semantic Web applications in the cultural Linked Open Data (LOD) domain. The main goal is the semantic integration, enrichment and interlinking of data that are generated through the documentation process of artworks and cultural heritage objects. This is accomplished by using state-of-the-art technologies and current standards of the Semantic Web (RDF, OWL, SPARQL), as well as widely accepted models and vocabularies relevant to the cultural domain (Dublin Core, SKOS, Europeana Data Model). A set of specialized tools such as KARMA and OpenRefine/RDF-extension is being used and evaluated in order to achieve the semantic integration of museum data from heterogeneous sources. Interlinking is achieved using tools such as Silk and OpenRefine/RDF-extension, discovering links (at the back-end) between disparate datasets and other external data sources such as DBpedia and Wikidata that enrich the source data. Finally, a front-end Web application is developed in order to exploit the semantically integrated and enriched museum data, and further interlink (and enrich) them (at application run-time), with the data sources of DBpedia and Europeana. The paper discusses engineering choices made for the evaluation of the proposed framework/pipeline. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Cultural heritage institutions have recently begun to consider the benefits of sharing their collections using linked open data to disseminate and enrich their metadata. As datasets become very large, challenges appear, such as ingestion, management, querying and enrichment. Furthermore, each institution has particular features related to important aspects such as vocabularies and interoperability, which make it difficult to generalise this process and provide one-for-all solutions. In order to improve the user experience as regards information retrieval systems, researchers have identified that further refinements are required for the recognition and extraction of implicit relationships expressed in natural language. We introduce a framework for the enrichment and disambiguation of locations in text using open knowledge bases such as Wikidata and GeoNames. The framework has been successfully used to publish a dataset based on information from the Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes, thus illustrating how semantic enrichment can help information retrieval. The methods applied in order to automate the enrichment process, which build upon open source software components, are described herein. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Campania is one of the most important region of Italy for its Cultural Heritage, in fact UNESCO has already declared five World Heritage Sites and many others, considered "minor", that are not adequately promoted in spite of their high artistic value. Cultural Heritage is an inestimable resource that should be protected, preserved and promoted by “inserting” it in the digital ecosystem of a Smart City, where economic, tourist, recreational and logistic aspects are all considered together. In this paper, it is introduced and described a framework for the description of the archaeological evidences and artistic artefacts according to the main standards that are in literature. A case study related to the description of archaeological excavations is analysed. © 2015 Metrology for Archaeology, MetroArchaeo

AB  - A new neutron radiography / tomography / imaging instrument DINGO was built to support the area of neutron imaging research (neutron radiography/tomography) at ANSTO. The instrument is designed for an international user community and for routine quality control for defense, industrial, cultural heritage and archaeology applications. In the industrial field it provides a useful tool for studying cracking and defects in steel or other metals. The instrument construction was completed at the end of June 2013 and it is currently in the hot commissioning stage. The usable neutron flux is mainly determined by the neutron source, but it depends on the instrument position and the resolution. The instrument position for DINGO is the thermal neutron beam port HB-2 in the reactor hall. The measured flux (using gold foil) for an L/D of approximately 500 at HB-2 is 5.3∗107 [n/cm2s], which is in a similar range to other facilities. A special feature of DINGO is the in-pile collimator position in front of the main shutter at HB-2. The collimator offers two pinholes with a possible L/D of 500 and 1000. A secondary collimator separates the two beams by blocking one and positions another aperture for the other beam. The whole instrument operates in two different positions, one for high resolution and one for high speed. In the current configuration DINGO measured first radiography and tomography data sets on friendly user test samples. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper we describe the pilot project dati.culturaitalia.it, which started in 2012 to build up a Linked Open Data (LOD) Service that will progressively make available open datasets from the web-portal CulturaItalia 1, the Italian national aggregator for Europeana 2. CIDOC-CRM Ontology was used for transformation and representation of data widely pertaining to the cultural domain. RDF triples mapped into Erlangen CRM were then enriched with links to URIs identifying instances of internationally established RDF resources for geographic names, and instances of authority files for personal and corporate names, such as GeoNames and Virtual International Authority File (VIAF). CulturaItalia is the Portal of Italian Culture, promoted by the Italian Ministry of cultural heritage, activities and tourism (MiBACT), in which cultural institutions from all sectors and levels (national, regional and local) are involved. CulturaItalia also plays an important role for the development of Europeana, making available cooperative networks and agreements and coordinating technical activities leading to the establishment of Europeana environment. © 2015, CEUR-WS.

AB  - We present an interactive visualization system developed for the valorization of an extraordinary collection of protostoric Mediterranean sculptures, which depict models of buildings (cone-shaped stone towers), as well as larger-than-life human figures. The architecture is based on scalable components for efficient distribution and adaptive rendering of extremely detailed surface meshes, as well as a simple and effective interactive camera controller tailored for touch interaction. The user interface has been designed for targeting both small screens and large display systems, and in a way that casual users can easily and naturally explore the models with fast learning curves. Furthermore, a thumbnail-based point-of-interest selector enable users to explore 3D views with information presented as 2D overlays decorating the 3D scene. The system components have been integrated in different interactive applications, ranging from large-screen museal setups and low end mobile devices both with very high visual quality. The capabilities of the museal systems have been demonstrated in a variety of temporal and permanent exhibitions, where they have been extensively used by tens of thousands of visitors. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - The 200,000 records in the catalogue of the Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes have been migrated to a new relational database whose data model adheres to the FRBR and FRAD specifications. The database content has been later mapped to RDF triples which employ the RDA vocabulary to describe the entities, as well as their properties and relationships. The intermediate relational model —ensuring, for example, referential integrity—provides tighter control over the process and, therefore, enhanced validation of the output. This RDF-based semantic description of the catalogue is now accessible online and supports browsing and searching the information. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Micro-augmentations provide novel ways to interact directly with the past. This is a new concept that uses minimum stimulation to achieve maximum effects in spaces of cultural heritage. We experiment with new implicitly interactive and almost transparent museum technologies to create a holistic emotional visitor experience and solve a number of museum problems (i.e. misconceptions, intra-group communications, and visitor engagement). The paper presents the rationale for the design decisions, as well as the technical challenges faced during implementation. Audio micro-augmentations were firstly used at the UCL Grant Museum of Zoology. Initial user testing data from the system's calibration phase at that museum revealed the entertaining and learning potential of the application, together with issues for future development. © 2015 ACM.

AB  - The “K-Culture Time Machine” project develops technologies to structure diverse cultural content from associated organizations and projects, including the “Cultural Heritage hub-bank,” and construct new cultural content connected to time and space, then develop a technique that provides the structured content to industries (culture, tourism, IT) and the public. To integrate heterogeneous dataset, designing a new data model is a vital process for our project. As Europeana designed data model which aims to integrate and link several data set across cultural institutions of Europe, we also invented a new data model that encompasses a wide range of metadata for cultural institution in Korea. This approach and data model aim to provide a possibility of semantic link between heterogeneous dataset. This project also provides services with various visualization techniques (virtual reality, augmented reality, etc.) for cultural heritage by traveling through a variety of historical periods in its contents. Last, the project develops image-based time-space content configuration techniques and a software framework that enables visualization with various devices. We perform a validation and feedback process of research and development on the implemented prototype service “Journey of a Korean world cultural heritage”. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - In this paper, we present an application framework, ArsEmotica 2.0, where semantic technologies, linked data and natural language processing techniques are exploited for investigating the emotional aspects of cultural heritage artifacts, based on user generated contents collected in art social platforms. We rely on affective categorization models expressed by an ontology well grounded in psychology and encoded in W3C standard specification languages.We present the implementation and exploitation of the framework on a real dataset, the ArsMeteo online collection, aiming to adapt human access to cultural heritage collections by visualising emotions detected in artworks, and to let computer access by means of Linked Open Data. The use of semantic technologies enables both automatic reasoning on the elicited affective information, and interoperability or integration of tools developed within the Semantic Web and Linked Data Community.

AB  - Europeana is an international trusted digital initiative providing access, from a single entry point, to prized collections from a number of European cultural institutions. Advanced Internet and digital technologies present new ways to connect with users; and there is a need continued evaluation of digital libraries. This paper reports on a task oriented, usability study exploring a number of aspects including user satisfaction specific to the Europeana Digital Library. Participants were students from Library Science and Information Systems department, who had some basic experience searching digital collections for information. Participants performed 13 tasks, and focused on the Hellenistic collection. Methodologically, the test was consisted of a list of tasks that among others aimed to assess user satisfaction and interest while performing them. The method applied was measuring Effectiveness, Efficiency, Learnability and Satisfaction. Despite the fact that it was not the first time that they came in contact with a digital library, several participants had difficulties while performing selected tasks, especially when they involved a variety of search types. In general, all of the participants seemed to comprehend how Europeana is organized, although the results also indicate that participants had feelings that expectations were not met when performing more complex tasks. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - This paper describes the full procedure adopted in the context of the Clavius on the Web project, which aims to help Web users to appraise the importance of specific manuscripts by going beyond their digital reproduction. The proposed approach is based on the multilayered explication of linguistic, lexical and semantic data representing the innermost nature of the analyzed manuscripts. The final purpose of the project is to gather and display the results of the three layers of analysis through interactive visualization techniques and export them as Linked Data. All the analyses rely on the XML/TEI encoding of the text, followed by a CTS-based tokenization. As a working example for this paper, the analysis of a portion of a manuscript provided by Historical Archives of the Pontifical Gregorian University will be illustrated. The text is a letter written in Latin and sent by Botvitus Nericius to Christophorus Clavius in 1598 from Madrid. © 2014 ACM.

AB  - In this paper we outline the main lines of research for defining a framework based on Linked Open Data (LOD) for supporting knowledge creation in the Cultural Heritage (CH) field with a particular focus on History of Art research. We delineate the main challenges we need to deal with and we explore the state-of-the-art in LOD publishing systems, LOD citation and authority management. Furthermore, we introduce the idea of computer-aided serendipity in History of Art research with the purpose of contributing to the advancement of the field and to the definition of new methodologies for entity linking and retrieval.

AB  - This paper reports the outcomes of the conversation moderated by Anna Maria Tammaro, which took place in Bologna during the third AIUCD (Associazione per l'Informatica Umanistica e la Cultura Digitale) conference, between Karen Coyle and Gianmaria Silvello about convergences and divergences of Cultural Heritage (CH) and Computer Science (CS) communities about digital libraries and the Linked Open Data (LOD) paradigm. The conversation has been stimulated in the context of the community of Digital Humanities (DH) scholars, in order to actively engaging them in the linked open data and digital libraries services. The LOD paradigm is a promising technology not only for opening up digital libraries resources, but also for augmenting the discoverability, re-use, enrichment and sharing of their resources on the Web. For the digital libraries LOD can represent a quite significant shift from a "closed paradigm" where the domain expert (e.g the librarian) has the control of the resources to an "open paradigm" where the resources are free to circulate and evolve "without" explicit control of domain experts. In this paper we report some existing positive experiences of integration of the LOD paradigm in the digital library context where the LOD has been used as a publishing paradigm. We also discuss some limitations of the current approach by presenting some open problems that should be investigated to fully realize the LOD paradigm potentialities. © 2014 ACM.

AB  - In the cultural heritage domain, there is a huge interest in utilizing semantic web technology and build services enabling users to query, explore and access the vast body of cultural heritage information that has been created over decades by memory institutions. For successful conversion of existing data into semantic web data, however, there is often a need to enhance and enrich the legacy data to validate and align it with other resources and reveal its full potential. In this visionary paper, we describe a framework for semantic enrichment that relies on the creation of thematic knowledge bases, i.e., about a given topic. These knowledge bases aggregate information by exploiting structured resources (e.g., Linked Open Data cloud) and by extracting new relationships from streams (e.g., Twitter) and textual documents (e.g., web pages). Our focused application in this paper is how this approach can be utilized when transforming library records into semantic web data based on the FRBR model in the process that commonly is called FRBRization. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - The relevance of Named-Entity Recognition and Entity Linking for cultural heritage institutions is evaluated through a casestudy involving the semantic enrichment of historical periodicals. A language-independent approach is proposed in order to improve the search experience of end-users with the mapping of entities to the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud. Preliminary results show that a precision rate of almost 90% can be achieved with very little fine-tuning, while an increase in recall remains necessary. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.
