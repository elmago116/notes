AB  - Maintaining technical documentation is a challenge. Products are becoming more complex, product lifecycles are getting shorter, and the number of product variants is increasing. Manuals that guide personnel in the use and maintenance of products are critical to their efficient and safe operation. Authoring system for technical documentation therefore increasingly apply semantic models to control the cost of maintaining technical documentation. Working with formal semantic structures is challenging for technical writers who usually work with plain, written text. This paper presents an intuitive interface for a semantic knowledge graph to facilitate the adoption and use of semantic models in technical documentation. The interface allows working with unstructured text and to postpone its semantification. Users can add semantic annotations in an iterative and incremental way. The interface was developed using a user-centered design process and subjected to an evaluation with technical writers. The results indicate that technical writers could use the prototype successfully and enjoyed the underlying concepts. Further iterations will extend the system and, for example, use artificial intelligence to suggest semantic links to improve the quality of the knowledge graph.

AB  - The research focuses on the limitations of traditional systems in optimizing information flow in the healthcare domain. It focuses on integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) and utilizing AI-powered applications, specifically conversational agents (CAs), particularly during peak operational hours in emergency departments (EDs). Leveraging the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework, the authors tailored a customized methodology, CRISP-knowledge graph (CRISP-KG), designed to harness KGs for constructing an intelligent knowledge base (KB) for CAs. This KG augmentation empowers CAs with advanced reasoning, knowledge management, and context awareness abilities. We utilized a hybrid method integrating a participatory design collaborative methodology (CM) and Methontology to construct a domain-centric robust formal ontological model depicting and mapping information flow during peak hours in EDs. The ultimate objective is to empower CAs with intelligent KBs, enabling seamless interaction with end users and enhancing the quality of care within EDs. The authors leveraged semantic web rule language (SWRL) to enhance inferencing capabilities within the KG framework further, facilitating efficient information management for assisting healthcare practitioners and patients. This innovative assistive solution helps efficiently manage information flow and information provision during peak hours. It also leads to better care outcomes and streamlined workflows within EDs.

AB  - Linking and visualizing multiple types of entities in a DH knowledge graph generates the need to deal with multiple types of data and media modalities both on the designer and the user side. The InTaVia project develops synoptic visual representations for a multimodal historical knowledge graph which draws together transnational data about cultural objects and historical actors. In this paper we reflect on the question how to integrate and mediate the informational and visual affordances of both kinds of cultural data with hybrid designs and show how a user-centered design process can help to ground the required selections and design choices in an empirical procedure.

AB  - Dietary supplements (DS) are widely used. However, consumers know little about the safety and efficacy of DS. There is a growing interest in accessing health information online; however, online health information, especially information on DSs, is scattered with varying levels of quality. We prototyped a web application, ALOHA, with interactive graph-based visualizations to facilitate users' browsing of the integrated DIetary Supplement Knowledge base (iDISK) curated from scientific resources, following an iterative user-centered design (UCD) process.

AB  - Dietary supplements (DS) are widely consumed. However, most people have limited knowledge about the safety and efficacy of DS. Even though there exists the well-curated integrated DIetary Supplement Knowledge base (iDISK) with a formal knowledge representation, it lacks a user-friendly interface for general consumers to query and retrieve DS information relevant to their needs. Following user-centered design principles, we prototyped a web application, ALOHA (i.e., dietAry suppLement knOwledge grapH visuAlization), with interactive graph-based visualization to facilitate consumers' browsing of iDISK. We conducted a usability inspection and design session with a focus group and evaluated the usability of the prototype with a modified System Usability Scale (SUS). The SUS result was marginal (63.75 +/- 7.2 with 1 outlier removed). Nevertheless, all participants agreed that such an application is urgently needed to address the gaps in how DS information (and health information in general) are currently organized and consumed online. These feedbacks are valuable to inform the next iteration of ALOHA.

AB  - Personas are commonly used in User-centered Design (UCD) activities to help designers better understand users' needs. However, there is still a reliance on traditional approaches such as interviews and ethnography for building personas in UCD activities. To this end, we developed an auto-generating persona system to enhance practices in UCD course activities. Our persona system is developed based on the GPT-4 model, the DALL-E 2 model, and knowledge graphs. Hence, our persona system includes three main features of our persona system: automated processing of survey data, automatic generation of 2D avatars, and providing options for automatic or customized entity generation. We recruited a total of 22 participants to evaluate our persona system. Our findings confirmed that there was a significant difference in terms of efficiency, satisfaction, accuracy, and diversity. Meanwhile, participants provided both positive and negative feedback regarding our persona system. As on-going work, we discuss the current limitations of our persona system and explore future research directions to further improve its capabilities and effectiveness.

AB  - The rapid development of information and communication technologies has enabled a value co-creation paradigm for developing industrial products and services, where massive heterogeneous data and multidisciplinary knowledge are generated and leveraged. In this context, Knowledge Graph (KG) emerges as a promising tool to elicit, fuse, process, and utilize numerous entities and relationships embedded in products and services, as well as their stakeholders. Nevertheless, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there is scarcely any comprehensive and thorough discussion about making full use of KG's potentials to solve pain points of product development and service innovation in the industry. Aiming to fill this gap, this paper conducted a systematic survey of KG exploitations in industrial products and services and the customizations towards higher adaptability to practices. The authors selected 119 representative papers (up to 10/03/2021) together with other 29 supplementary works to summarize the technical and practical efforts and discuss the current challenges of exploiting KG in industrial products and services. Meantime, this work also highlights enhancing KG's availability and boosting its productivity in industrial products and services development as the core future perspectives to explore. It is hoped that this work can provide a basis for the explorations and implementations of KG-supported industrial product and services development, and attract more open discussions to the exploitation of KG-enabled industrial information systems.

AB  - With the rapid development of information technology (IT), especially after the wide application of 5G and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, community management has begun to actively explore the integration of IT. In this study, we analyzed 717 English articles on the topic of "smart community" in the Web of Science database by combining bibliometrics and traditional review methods. Using Citespace software, we explored the literature in terms of co-citation, keyword co-occurrence, literature clustering, and author-institution cooperation to identify eight key areas of smart community research, and established a comprehensive research framework accordingly. Based on this framework, this paper further provides a comprehensive analysis of key research themes and hot issues. The study shows that the current research focus on smart communities is mainly on how to effectively integrate smart technologies into community governance. With the further development of IoT and AI technologies, smart communities will focus more on civic engagement, social innovation, healthy communities and digital health, as well as smart economy and entrepreneurial ecology. These areas are expected to be potential points for future research.

AB  - Introduction We present a prototype solution for improving transparency and quality assurance of the data linkage process through data provenance tracking designed to assist Data Analysts, researchers and information governance teams in authenticating and auditing data workflows within a Trusted Research Environment (TRE). Methods Using a participatory design process with Data Analysts, researchers and information governance teams, we undertook a contextual inquiry, user requirements interviews, co-design workshops, low-fidelity prototype evaluations. Public Engagement and Involvement activities underpinned the methods to ensure the project and approaches met the public's trust for semi-automating data processing. These helped inform methods for technical implementation, applying the PROV-O ontology to create a derived ontology following the four-step Linked Open Terms methodology and development of automated scripts to collect provenance information for the data processing workflow. Results The resulting Provenance Explorer for Trusted Research Environments (PE-TRE) interactive tool displays the data linkage information extracted from a knowledge graph described using the derived SHP ontology and results of rule-based validation checks. User evaluations confirmed PE-TRE would contribute to better quality data linkage and reduce data processing errors. Conclusion This project demonstrates the next stage in advancing transparency and quality assurance within TREs by semi-automating and systematising data tracking in a single tool throughout the data processing lifecycle, improving transparency, openness and quality assurance.

KW  - Dewey decimal classification
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study is to develop a conceptual model, ProvKOS, for tracking the provenance of change activities in a knowledge organization system (KOS). By extending current provenance practices, this model represents dynamic changes in a KOS more effectively.Design/methodology/approachWe take a five-step approach to develop the conceptual model, including content analysis of KOS editorial data, environmental scan of existing provenance models, development of persona-specific provenance questions and a participatory design with stakeholders to ensure the model's utility.FindingsWe introduce (1) a taxonomy of editorial activities for a KOS; (2) a conceptual model ProvKOS, which extends existing models PROV and Simple Knowledge Organization Systems (SKOS). We also provide detailed data dictionaries for the entities, activities and warrants classes proposed in the model. A use case on "gender dysphoria" in Dewey Decimal Classifications (DDCs) is provided to illustrate the implementation of ProvKOS. This shows ProvKOS's ability to capture KOS changes effectively and to link external resources relating to the changes.Research limitations/implicationsFurther validation may be needed to implement the ProvKOS model across various types of KOSs.Practical implicationsProvKOS can help improve machine readability, querying and analysis of a KOS. Especially within the linked data environment, the enhanced provenance documentation through ProvKOS can enable a network of KOSs, which will then inform better linked data or knowledge graph designs.Social implicationsBy facilitating better tracking of changes within a KOS and across KOSs, ProvKOS can enhance the accessibility and usability of knowledge bases across different cultural and social contexts, thus better supporting inclusive information practices.Originality/valueThe proposed model is novel in two ways: one, its ability to represent dynamic change activities in a KOS, which has not been discussed anywhere else; two, it supports the interconnectivity across KOSs by providing a "warrant" class to substantiate the context of changes.

AB  - The increasing digitalization and automatization in the manufacturing industry as well as the need to learn on the job has reinforced the need for much more granular learning, which has not yet impacted the design of learning materials. In this regard, granular learning concepts require situated learning materials to support self-directed learning in the workplace in a targeted manner. Co-creation approaches offer promising opportunities to support employees in the independent design of such situated learning materials. Using an action-design research (ADR) approach, we derived requirements from co-creation concepts and practice by conducting focus group workshops in manufacturing and vocational training schools to develop design principles for a co-creation system that supports employees through the creation process of work-process-related learning material. Consequently, we formulate four design principles for the design of a collaborative learning and qualification system for manufacturing. Using an innovative mixed methods approach, we validate these design principles and design features to demonstrate the success of the developed artifact. The results provide insights regarding the design of a co-creation system to support learners in the co-creation of learning material with the consideration of cognitive load (CL). Our study contributes to research and practice by proposing novel design principles for supporting employees in peer creation processes. Furthermore, our study reveals how co-creation systems can support the collaborative development of learning materials in the work process.

AB  - Under the umbrella of the SEE/B/0016/4.3/X Project SAGITTARIUS a new cultural heritage infrastructure has been introduced in South East Europe. The main aim is to facilitate cognitive-emotional experiences in cultural heritage environments by effectively communicating cultural values to non-captives audiences. A 3-component Roving Museum (RM) is operated in seven countries (GR, BG, HR, HU, IT, RO). The RM adapts to visitor needs in a constantly changing knowledge ecosystem implementing new ways of recreational learning and visitor satisfaction. It includes a QRC-driven portable exhibition with 110 cultural heritage narratives, accessible via QRCs in the territory, an app for iOS and Android, and a social media driven participatory space, to support contextual co-creation and participatory learning. A cognitive driven communication pattern has been developed and adapted to the conditions regulating the recreational learning environment. The pattern employs interrelated content segments in order to free the working memory (WM) from irrelevant cognitive loads, enabling new cognitive content to relate to prior knowledge. The design presupposes a limited WM capacity to deal with visual, auditory and verbal material, and an almost unlimited long-term memory (LTM), able to hold mental representations that vary in their degree of automation. It considers WM constraints, element interactivity and 3 types of cognitive loads (CL). Cognitive accessibility is ensured through provision of novelty and variety, surprise and exploration, strictly avoiding engagement in complex cognitive procedures. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: Patient decision aids (PtDAs) can support shared decision-making (SDM) by providing information about options, pros and cons and eliciting personal preferences. The aim of this study was to develop and test the acceptability and usability of a PtDA for patients with metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the most common type of metastatic kidney cancer. Methods: User-centered mixed methods design. Co-creation process with stakeholders guided by the International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) criteria, consisting of three main elements: (a) a needs assessment; (b) acceptability and usability testing; and (c) compatibility assessment with IPDAS criteria. Results: Thirteen RCC patients and 29 healthcare professionals (HCP) participated in this study. Co-creation sessions were held with nine HCPs and a patient representative. Needs assessment (a) showed that patients lacked real treatment choices and wanted information on all treatment options, including life expectancy, side effects, psychological, and lifestyle advice. HCPs expect a PtDA to improve information delivery and patient engagement. A three-component PtDA was developed and tested (b), with positive feedback from both patients and professionals. The tool meets all 12 IPDAS criteria (c). Conclusions: The web-based PtDA was developed and adapted to address unmet needs and found to be acceptable and usable by patients and HCPs. Practice implications: The use of this tool could contribute to high quality, patient-centered and appropriate care for metastatic clear cell RCC patients in the Netherlands.

AB  - As cities embrace smart technologies for urban development, the demand for new urban mobility solutions grows. However, capturing and prioritising diverse citizen needs poses challenges. In response, we introduce a serious tabletop game tailored for urban mobility requirements engineering. Our research aims to design and evaluate the effectiveness of this game in facilitating user engagement and optimising the elicitation, prioritisation and analysis of requirements in the context of urban mobility solutions. Our approach builds on previous serious gaming studies while focusing on citizen engagement and customisation for urban contexts. The game comprises collaborative activities using a co-design canvas. Through iterative playtesting and usability testing, the game's design is refined.

AB  - The factory floor is experiencing growing automation, which requires thorough training for workers to adapt to these advancements. This paper presents a part of a research project focused on developing a training interface (TI) utilizing Augmented Reality (AR) for workers in the furniture manufacturing industry. The research adopts a human-centered approach, incorporating co-creation sessions with stakeholders and usability testing. The objective is to design an AR interface that aligns with user needs and preferences, thereby enhancing efficiency, user experience, and satisfaction. Preliminary usability tests involved twelve participants using a low-fidelity prototype and six participants using a mid-fidelity prototype. The findings suggest that a well-designed AR training interface, developed in collaborationwith users, can enhance the training experience on the factory floor, making it more satisfactory and leading to better acceptance. Future work will focus on further refining the interface based on continuous user feedback and expanding the application to other industrial tasks.

AB  - People increasingly view mobility as a service and want more choices for traveling between points A and B. Designing user experiences of future robo-taxi needs to be seen from a broad perspective and consider an extended user journey. Our work explores the application of quick and dirty prototyping and usability testing to design UX of future robo-taxi services from the ground up. We made low-fidelity prototypes early in the design process and quickly tested with users iteratively to answer initial questions arisen on critical touchpoints in the user journey. Two critical touchpoints are rider-driverless car match and in-car environment configuration. Five optional eHMI (external HMI) were tested, and our results suggest combining options depending on the distance between the vehicle and the passenger. We also tested two environment templates and found that preference depends on travel time regardless of the purpose of the journey. Finally, we suggest a service scenario composed of 14 scenes.

AB  - Within the realm of teacher education, effective tools as support can enhance pre-service teachers' comprehension of STEM concepts and their ability to tackle with complex problems. This research aims to empirically investigate the impact of ChatGPT-supported collaborative learning on pre-service teachers' STEM teaching literacy, learning performance, and cognitive load. A total of 36 sophomore undergraduate pre-service teachers participated in an 8-week quasi-experimental study (with classes lasting 3 hours each week). These pre-service teachers were tasked with creating teaching aids and simulating instructional sessions. The experimental group engaged in small-group collaborative learning assisted by ChatGPT (N=21), while the control group (N=15) conducted conventional collaborative learning. The results indicate that pre-service teachers using ChatGPT demonstrated superior performance in terms of learning performance and cognitive load, though the improvement in STEM teaching literacy was not evident. However, ChatGPT contributed to students' acquisition and comprehension of STEM teaching knowledge. In essence, within a collaborative learning context, ChatGPT exhibits significant potential in addressing complex issues and offering personalized support but also we should mitigate potential risks. Collaborative learning with human-machine co-creation is poised to be a trend in the future of education, offering innovative avenues for the cultivation of STEM pre-service teachers.

AB  - The utilization of decision support systems, in the point of care, to alert drug-drug interactions has been shown to improve quality of care. Still, the use of these systems has not been as expected, it is believed, because of the difficulties in their knowledge databases; errors in the generation of the alerts and the lack of a suitable design. This study expands on the development of alerts using participatory design techniques based on user centered design process. This work was undertaken in three stages (inquiry, participatory design and usability testing) it showed that the use of these techniques improves satisfaction, effectiveness and efficiency in an alert system for drug-drug interactions, a fact that was evident in specific situations such as the decrease of errors to meet the specified task, the time, the workload optimization and users overall satisfaction in the system.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to transition our user-centered research and design activities in the emergency medical domain of trauma resuscitation from in-person settings to online environments. This transition required that we replicate the in-person interactions remotely while maintaining the critical social connection and the exchange of ideas with medical providers. In this paper, we describe how we designed and conducted four user-centered design activities from our homes: participatory design workshops, near-live simulation sessions, usability evaluation sessions, and interviews and design walkthroughs. We discuss the differences we observed in our interactions with participants in remote sessions, as well as the differences in the interactions among the research team members. From this experience, we draw several lessons and outline the best practices for remotely conducting user-centered design activities that have been traditionally held in person.

AB  - Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a program similar to cryptocurrency that runs on blockchain. Due to its recent popularity, the user count increases every day. NFT, a relatively new technology compared to cryptocurrency brings many new terms and complicated user flows. The study was conducted to explore the motives of new NFT users, to identify the usability issues in those platforms that tend to be a barrier and to suggest relevant design approaches that help new users freely use the platform. A survey was conducted to identify the understanding of NFTs among various user groups. Further, usability testing and heuristic evaluation were carried out for the top 2 popular NFT marketplaces. The results show that the NFT platforms need more usability improvements, especially for first-time users. Based on the findings, relevant user-centered design approaches are suggested and are expected to improve the usability of the NFT platforms.

AB  - This paper describes the design and evaluation process of two mobile programming assistance tools that allow children in the early childhood to develop programs and execute them using robots. The tools are called TITIBOTS and TITIBOTS Colab which incorporates collaboration. The tools have icon-based interfaces and integrate visual programming, robotics, and mobile devices as one tool. The main issues and lessons learned during the design process are described. The methodology used in this project was User-Centered Design (UCD) process. The tools were developed and evaluated applying participatory-design, experience prototyping, and usability testing. The final product are two simple, intuitive, and easy to use tools, for children between 4 and 6 years old. The results were promising: children liked the applications and were willing to continue using it to program robots for solving specific tasks.

AB  - This paper presents usability tests results with real users during the prototype development phase of two applications for seniors care, AALFred and SmartCompanion. To this aim, usability testing was performed considering a Living Lab approach. Seniors were invited to use the applications in an environment that simulates the one they would use the tested technology during their everyday life. Observation methods, thinking aloud and questionnaires were used to collect data related to the systems' effectiveness and users' satisfaction, namely their expectations, frustrations and difficulties. Evaluations were performed during the initial phases of product development and results were used to improve the applications, considering the development cycle of User-Centered Design methodology.

AB  - Objectives: Readmission following colorectal surgery, typically due to surgery-related complications, is common. Patient-centered discharge warnings may guide recognition of early complication signs after colorectal surgery.
   Materials and Methods: User-centered design of a discharge warnings tool consisted of iterative health literacy review and a heuristic evaluation with human factors and clinical experts as well as patient end users to establish content validity and usability.
   Results: Literacy evaluation of the prototype suggested>12th-grade reading level. Subsequent revisions reduced reading level to 8th grade or below. Contents were formatted during heuristic evaluation into 3 action-oriented zones (green, yellow, and red) with relevant warning lexicons. Usability testing demonstrated comprehension of this 3-level lexicon and recognition of appropriate patient actions to take for each level.
   Discussion: We developed a discharge warnings tool for colorectal surgery using staged user-centered design. The lexicon of surgical discharge warnings could structure communication among patients, caregivers, and clinicians to improve post-discharge care.

AB  - Learning to use geographic information system (GIS) software effectively may be intimidating due to the extensive range of features it offers. The GRASS GIS software, in particular, presents additional challenges for first-time users in terms of its complex startup procedure and unique terminology associated with its data structure. On the other hand, a substantial part of the GRASS user community including us as developers recognized and embraced the advantages of the current approach. Given the controversial nature of the whole issue, we decided to actively involve regular users by conducting several formal surveys and by performing usability testing. Throughout this process, we discovered that resolving specific software issues through pure user-centered design is not always feasible, particularly in the context of open-source scientific software where the boundary between users and developers is very fuzzy. To address this challenge, we adopted the user-centered methodology tailored to the requirements of open-source scientific software development, which we refer to as community-driven design. This paper describes the community-driven redesigning process on the GRASS GIS case study and sets a foundation for applying community-driven design in other open-source scientific projects by providing insights into effective software development practices driven by the needs and input of the project's community.

KW  - SAFETY
AB  - Despite basic federal requirements promoting a user-centered design approach to electronic health record (EHR) development and usability testing there have been usability and safety risks with EHR technology. Four EHR vendors were asked to provide written descriptions of their usability practices, and we reviewed these descriptions to identify areas where there has been advancement and areas for improvement. All 4 vendors described user-centered design processes and usability testing methods that demonstrate advancement from previous studies of vendor practices. Importantly, vendors are also beginning to address aspects of EHR implementation that play a critical role in shaping EHR usability. There are important areas for improvement in vendor practices including a greater focus on safety and on measurement and benchmarking. Vendors sharing their current usability practices demonstrates a step toward greater transparency which has typically been lacking.

AB  - People with hearing loss have limitation in communication. According to this study in SLB-B Cicendo Bandung, Indonesia, most of the deaf students are enthusiastic to learn English. Meanwhile, they consider learning English is very hard because of the differences in pronunciation and spelling. In Indonesia, the education media to learn English is not developed much. The aim is to deliver proper interaction and user interface design for education media to help deaf youths learning English. This study uses user-centered design approach because deaf youths are unique. The proposed design for this study is a conceptual model using gamification, repetition, and leveling concept. This conceptual model uses picture, lip-reading video, text, and sign language to help users understand the contents. For usability testing, the design was implemented into high-fidelity prototype of hybrid mobile application. The result showed that the design of the prototype was already suited to most of the proposed usability goals and user experiences.

AB  - The Chinese government has developed a unique "Smart Eldercare" model that utilizes digital technologies to address the growing needs of its rapidly aging population. To implement this model, the government has initiated policies to accelerate talent cultivation, highlighting the importance of Smart Eldercare education at different levels in universities and vocational schools. This paper presents the design and development of an aging scenario Wiki and conducts a usability evaluation of this Wiki as a collaborative learning tool for nascent Smart Eldercare education. First, during the development phase, we conducted lab-based usability testing using 18 tasks of 3 types with 12 student participants who followed the think-aloud protocol. Our analysis identified seven usability issues, and we subsequently addressed them in the optimization phase. Second, we evaluated the usability of the aging scenario Wiki as a learning tool in actual work teaching activities involving 54 students who collaborated on creating aging scenarios. The evaluation yields a System Usability Scale score of 67.45 and a C usability rating, indicating the areas for further improvement. Overall, the aging scenario Wiki demonstrated the potential to be a practical and effective learning tool for nascent Smart Eldercare education. Our study highlights the importance of user-centered design and usability testing in developing educational resources for emerging fields such as Smart Eldercare.

AB  - Background: Rural local health departments (LHDs) lack adequate capacity and funding to effectively make data driven decisions to support their communities that face greater health disparities compared to urban counterparts. The need, therefore, exists for informatics solutions to support rural LHDs.Purpose: We describe the user-centered design (UCD) of SHARE-NW: Solutions in Health Analytics for Rural Equity across the Northwest, a website (sharenw.nwcphp.org) with data visualization dashboards for rural LHD practitioners in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington to help them identify health disparities in their jurisdictions.Methods: In this UCD study guided by Munzner's Nested Model for Visualization Design and Validation, we (1) completed a needs assessment, (2) created and evaluated mockups, and (3) conducted usability testing of a functional alpha testing website. Potential end-users (rural LHD practitioners) and Equity Advisory Committee members (public health experts from state, rural local, and tribal public health agencies) across our four-state catchment area were engaged throughout the website development and testing. We adapted traditional in person UCD methods to be remote to reach participants across a large geographic area and in rural/frontier areas of Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.Results: We recruited participants from all four states to engage in each stage of the project. Needs assessment findings informed the mockup development, and findings from the mockup evaluations informed the development of the functional website. Usability testing of the website overall was positive, with priority usability issues identified.Conclusions: By applying Munzner's Nested Model and UCD, we could purposefully and intentionally design evidence-based solutions, specifically for rural LHD practitioners. Adaptations of traditional UCD methods were successful and allowed us to reach end-users across a large geographic area. Future work on SHARE-NW will involve the evaluation of the website. We provide insights on our lessons learned to support future public health informatics solution development.

AB  - In this paper, we present a crossover experiment with a remote usability testing to validate a User Centered Design process applied to a point-of-sale user interfaces redesign, in which the original software product interfaces had a low grade of usability. It was developed as a structured usability remote test plan applied with two samples of users through a crossover experiment. Each sample was composed by 6 participants that had close knowledge about information systems features and other personality attributes obtained by the cashier profile designed through the personas technique. Cashiers are a fundamental role, since they use this software many hours per day, and are very rotative employees, that tend to be young people between 18 and 25 years old. We obtained favorable results, as each sample decreased their execution time in completing the 10 given tasks in more than one minute, which is a valuable time in sales, and it reduced their dependency to ask for help or making operational mistakes in the sale's process. They emphasized some improved points such as "more understandable labels", "more striking and pleasant colors", "better visualization of the components", and "much easier process to use".

AB  - A lot of smartphone users are still novice and have difficulty in operating tasks using their smartphone, including running applications, for example running an online Arisan application. Arisan is a traditional social gathering that is common in Indonesia. Members of arisan contribute to and take turns at winning, and most of the arisan users are novice users. In this paper, we present the results of our observations to determine problems faced by the novice users when using an online arisan application. The user-centered design approach is employed to analyze the problems and to design the new online arisan application prototype. The prototype is designed based on the usability goal and the user experience defined for the novice users. We conduct a usability testing to evaluate the prototype. The testing results show that the prototype fulfills the usability goal and the user experience.

AB  - Objective: Currently, there are few resources for electronic health record (EHR) purchasers and end users to understand the usability processes employed by EHR vendors during product design and development. We developed a framework, based on human factors literature and industry standards, to systematically evaluate the user-centered design processes and usability testing methods used by EHR vendors.
   Materials and Methods: We reviewed current usability certification requirements and the human factors literature to develop a 15-point framework for evaluating EHR products. The framework is based on 3 dimensions: user-centered design process, summative testing methodology, and summative testing results. Two vendor usability reports were retrieved from the Office of the National Coordinator's Certified Health IT Product List and were evaluated using the framework.
   Results: One vendor scored low on the framework (5 pts) while the other vendor scored high on the framework (15 pts). The 2 scored vendor reports demonstrate the framework's ability to discriminate between the variabilities in vendor processes and to determine which vendors are meeting best practices.
   Discussion: The framework provides a method to more easily comprehend EHR vendors' usability processes and serves to highlight where EHR vendors may be falling short in terms of best practices. The framework provides a greater level of transparency for both purchasers and end users of EHRs. Conclusion: The framework highlights the need for clearer certification requirements and suggests that the authorized certification bodies that examine vendor usability reports may need to be provided with clearer guidance.

AB  - Emerging technologies have played an important role in driving major changes in human society. However, the advent of most technologies is typically initially accompanied by confusion; this is often because technology developers overlook the user perspective. This study was conducted to systematically determine the fundamental causes of problems that users encounter when they interact with blockchain technology, one of the promising emerging technologies today, and to suggest relevant design strategies. To this end, usability evaluation was conducted for the KDEX decentralized exchange application. To ensure the effective identification of the significant usability problems, heuristic evaluation with four experts and usability testing with 23 experimental participants were carried out. The results obtained show that more user-centered design is necessary to enable the widespread use of decentralized applications. Based on the experimental findings, actionable design strategies that facilitate the effective utilization of emerging technologies are suggested. The proposed strategies are expected to enable users to easily understand and navigate applications based on these technologies.

AB  - Rumah Belajar is a free web-based application which can be used as a supplementary learning platform for students in Indonesia. Since its release, there has not been any research on its usability. To increase the satisfaction and comfort of the users, research about usability, evaluation is needed. This research is conducted to better understand the user needs and analyze the flaws of the application. Evaluation was done using a questionnaire and a system usability scale as the quantitative method along with usability testing and a contextual interview as the qualitative method. Through the user-centered design, research involved the users to make sure that the application is aligned with the users' expectations. The results of the research suggest that the usability of the Rumah Belajar application needs to be improved. The design is made in the form of a prototype that will solve the raised issues. The designed prototype was tested on the users through usability testing. After being tested, the new suggested design could solve the majority of the usability issues.

CP  - 2nd International Conference on Computing and Applied Informatics
AB  - The development of mobile technology is now increasing rapidly, demanding all activities including learning should be done on mobile devices. It shows that the implementation of mobile application as a learning medium needs to be done. This study describes the process of developing and evaluating the Moodle-based mobile Learning Management System (LMS) application called Student Centered e-Learning Environment (SCeLE). This study discusses the process of defining features, implementing features into the application, and evaluating the application. We define the features using user research and literature study, then we implement the application with user-centered design basis, at the last phase we evaluated the application using usability testing and system usability score (SUS). The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which this application can help the users doing their tasks and provide recommendation for the next research and development.

AB  - Online programs risk higher student dropout rates. Supporting learning tools such as learning analytics dashboards (LADs) can promote self-regulated learning and positively impact student outcomes. In this paper, a three-level design study is presented that demonstrates the reduction of cognitive load at multiple levels when students are involved in the LAD design process. Through a user-centered design process (including requirements analysis and expert interviews), a wire-frame was developed using participatory methods and evaluated by 24 university students using the laws of Gestalt psychology, resulting in a clickable, low-fidelity prototype (LFD). This was then evaluated by 24 university students using the interaction principles of EN ISO 9241-110:2020. The refined LFD was further evaluated with university students in an eye-tracking study using the thinking-aloud technique (n = 10). The feedback emphasized the importance of participatory design and provided critical insights into the most effective use of the LAD and its elements, taking into account cognitive aspects. The results showed significant optimization in the small details and the big picture in the use of content elements, e.g., it is a crucial part to create a navigation structure adapted to the needs of an LAD and it is beneficial to present a reduced level of information during the initial access, with the option to add or access additional elements as needed.

AB  - Chatbot-based conversational commerce which allows buyers to do online shopping by conversing with chatbot through messaging application has been growing in the e-commerce industry. However, based on studies conducted in this paper, findings show that interaction design of the existing conversational commerce are still lacking in various areas. Therefore, an interaction and interface design for chatbot-based conversational commerce are developed in this study using user-centered design. The outcome of this study is a prototype that fulfills the usability goal and the user experience goal defined for chatbot-based conversational commerce on mobile platform especially for Indonesian users. We conduct usability testing to evaluate the prototype. The results show that the prototype fulfills the defined usability goals and user experience goals as 100% users agree that the prototype is effective to use, efficient to use, easy to learn, enjoyable and helpful, although only 83.3% users agree that the prototype is safe to use.

AB  - Pre-medical students face the challenge of managing rigorous academic and extracurricular demands, which can lead to burnout. Effective tracking and visualization of their activities are crucial in keeping records of student progress. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a user-friendly dashboard tailored for pre-medical student data management. Semi-structured interviews with nine medical sciences baccalaureate program (MSBP) faculty members identified major issues in current data management practices, including standardization and tracking. Using affinity diagramming and Miroboard, five key themes emerged, guiding the creation of an initial dashboard prototype. After iterative critiques and revisions, the final design received positive feedback from the MSBP committee. Limitations include a small sample size and a lack of formal usability testing. Future work will focus on addressing implementation challenges and refining the design based on user feedback.

AB  - Breastfeeding has numerous health benefits; however, many mothers do not continue breastfeeding to the recommended 6 months of age. Breastfeeding support after discharge from the hospital is often lacking in the communities with the greatest need. Therefore, the Mother's Milk Connection mHealth application was designed to improve breastfeeding duration and access to support. This article describes a user-centered design process to engage mothers in the development of the Mother's Milk Connection application. Two phases of stakeholder and user studies were conducted. Phase 1 involved concept generation, prototype development, and usability testing. Phase 2 focused on prototype redesign and usability testing. We used a descriptive mixed-method approach with data collected using a demographic questionnaire, System Usability Scale, exit survey, and focus groups. Final features of the Mother's Milk Connection application included resources and education, peer support, automated activity tracking, and professional support via video conference. Stakeholder and user engagement indicated the integration of four distinct features is acceptable for use as a comprehensive mHealth intervention to improve access to breastfeeding support. mHealth has the potential to be a useful strategy for providing breastfeeding support, and a clinical trial regarding the efficacy of the Mother's Milk Connection application is needed.

AB  - Diabetes management applications effectively help patients monitor blood glucose levels and adjust diet and exercise plans. However, most diabetes management apps, including the SugarShift application developed in 2023, use generalized designs that often fail to consider the unique cognitive and physiological characteristics of elderly users, thereby impacting their acceptance and usage. This paper proposes an enhancement for the SugarShift application by introducing a mode specifically designed for elderly users. This proposed enhancement aims to directly involve elderly patients so as to meet their needs better through a participatory design approach. A heuristic evaluation conducted with six experts identified 126 usability issues and 179 heuristic violations in the current version, which has led to the recommendation to develop optimization strategies tailored for elderly users. Subsequent usability testing with 28 elderly patients and six experts emphasized the importance of interface simplicity, logical operation, and interaction quality in enhancing user experience. These factors improve usability, facilitate information processing, and reduce cognitive load. Despite the overall usability of SUS scores, significant challenges still need to be addressed in information display, system feedback, and user interaction. Recommendations for future enhancements include simplifying data entry and presentation, improving readability, and providing timely feedback to enhance usability and user satisfaction, ultimately increasing user retention.

AB  - Guidance and counseling services have an important role in moral assistance and directing students' talents and interests. The Covid-19 pandemic has hampered Counseling Guidance services because learning activities are carried out online. This study aims to conduct a UI and UX assessment of the counseling application based on the Cased Based Reasoning algorithm called B-Talk This application was developed with a mobile platform design. Infernalities than the approach used is the User-Centered Design (UCD). The UCD approach is an approach that uses factors human, knowledge of usability techniques, and an interactive approach to developing design and systems. The UI(User Interface) and UX(User Experience) designs that have been produced will be tested with an expert assessment of Counseling Guidance which includes two aspects, namely usability testing and User Experience Question (UEQ). The media validation assessment was obtained from an average value of 89.2% of the standard feasibility without revision. In this case, it can be concluded that the B-Talk application design can be used as its function for Counseling Guidance media for adolescents.

AB  - Laws are formed by having a purpose, one of which is to obtain legal certainty in which legal awareness of the public become necessary. Several attempt to increase legal literacy is carried out through socialization, one of them in the form of an electronic consultation application on criminal law in Indonesia. Although there are several applications that present the legal case and information, there has not been much impact towards the primary intention and goal due to its offered features are still lacking related to how users utilize the application or called UX (User Experience). In this study, the design of an application is using the UX approach with the UCD (User Centered Design) method, then testing is conducted by usability evaluation. Among 3 (three) kind of designs using usability testing through scenario analysis resulted to the last design as the best alternative because it has the lowest severity of the problem.

AB  - Innovative, patient-centered mHealth interventions have the potential to help with the burden of chronic conditions. This review aims to describe the development of consumer mHealth interventions for chronic condition self-management. A scoping review methodology was used to search medical databases for eligible reports, published between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2017, that provided information on consumer mHealth interventions for respiratory disease, cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Twenty-one reports were included, representing the development of 14 mHealth interventions. Most were developed collaboratively, using user-centered and participatory design processes. Predesign work involved a thorough needs assessment, and redesign processes were described as iterative, engaging with usability testing and design improvements. Tensions from competing priorities between patients and healthcare professionals were uncovered, with the intention to develop a useful product for the patient while ensuring clinical relevance. This review provides clear evidence that consumer mHealth interventions are developed inconsistently even when engaging with participatory or user-centered design principles, sometimes without direct involvement of patients themselves. Further, the incomplete description of the development processes presents challenges to furthering the knowledge base as healthcare professionals need timely access to quality information on mHealth products in order to recommend safe, effective consumer mHealth interventions.

AB  - Children aged 10-12 years old are considered able to know and do first-aid. At those ages, children have been exposed to various learning medias. One of learning medias is game applications. Based on preliminary observations, by testing usability of existing game apps, User Interface is considered not good. Therefore, the users cannot use the application properly. This is caused by several factors. They are effectiveness, productivity, accessibility and universality. Applications that have low usability can be caused by the imperfection or insufficient of the application suitability with the needs of the user. In order to fit the user interface to the needs of the user, it is necessary to model the user interface of the first-aid application game using User Centered Design (UCD) method. Using UCD is used to generate a User Interface model that fits to the needs of the user. The modeling of the game application is formed in a prototype. After that, a test is conducted to the user to measure the usability of the game by using Quality in Use Integrated Measurement (QUIM). The results of usability testing is 81.05%.

AB  - Research shows that drivers rarely consult the vehicle owner's manual to learn to operate advanced safety features, like Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). Students from a United States university participated in a national competition, called EcoCAR Mobility Challenge (sponsored by the Department of Energy), to develop an engaging solution that is efficient and effective in educating drivers about the operation of ACC while adhering to user-centered design methodology. Students used an iterative design process and collected quantitative and qualitative data to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of a mobile application. Iterations of the prototype included an interactive guide, video components, remote connection to the vehicle, and ultimately a solution that could reside on the vehicle's infotainment system. This paper details the process and evaluation outcomes and serves as a model for user-centered design of tutorials for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).

AB  - People with vision impairments (VIP) are among the most vulnerable road users in traffic. Autonomous vehicles are believed to reduce accidents but still demand some form of external communication signaling relevant information to pedestrians. Recent research on the design of vehicle-pedestrian communication (VPC) focuses strongly on concepts for a non-disabled population. Our work presents an inclusive user-centered design for VPC, beneficial for both vision impaired and seeing pedestrians. We conducted a workshop with VIP (N=6), discussing current issues in road traffic and comparing communication concepts proposed by literature. A thematic analysis unveiled two important themes: number of communicating vehicles and content (affecting duration). Subsequently, we investigated these in a second user study in virtual reality (N=33, 8 VIP) comparing the VPC between groups of abilities. We found that trust and understanding is enhanced and cognitive load reduced when all relevant vehicles communicate; high content messages also reduce cognitive load.

AB  - Many applications are developed to assist in practicing zero waste, but the number of users for such applications is few. In this research, interaction for a new zero-waste application that uses gamification was designed to increase the number of users. The usage of gamification focused on cooperative elements because the practice of zero waste involves collaboration to achieve a mutual goal of decreasing waste. The design process used a user-centered design (UCD) approach, with the final product in a prototype application for a mobile device. The interface design aims for effectiveness and utility as usability goals, while its user experience goals are helpful and motivating. Based on usability testing conducted on the prototype, it is concluded that cooperative gamification elements usable in zero-waste applications include user groups, user roles, group-based goals, and cumulative points. The achievement of usability and user experience goals is measured using several metrics. They are success rate, single ease questions (SEQ), System Usability Scale (SUS), Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) subscale Value/Usefulness, and IMI subscale Interest/Enjoyment for measuring motivation.

AB  - digital eye strain is a combination of eye or vision problems associated with the use of digital screens. In addition, DES can reduce productivity and quality of life. Basically, DES is caused by the high intensity use of digital screens. Since the spread of COVID-19 increased in Indonesia, the duration of using digital screens has increased dramatically, which increases the risk of DES. Currently, there are many eye health apps in the community. However, existing apps still cannot meet their goals and needs, especially helping to maintain their motivation for eye health. Therefore, BetterEyes is designed with a user-centered design approach with gamification to keep them motivated. Survey research and user interviews were conducted to understand their behavior and problems. Usability testing are conducted in each iteration to evaluate the usability goals (effective to use and easy to learn) and user experience goals (motivating). The results in the last iteration showed the prototype designed was effective (100% completion rate), easy to learn (SEQ score 6.7 out of 7), and motivating (IMI score 6.09 out of 7). In addition, the overall usability aspect of the prototype is also categorized in the acceptable with an A score (SUS score 97.5 out of 100). Based on these results, it can be concluded that the designs are able to meet the goals and needs of the users in protecting their eyes from DES.

AB  - Introduction: Children are at increased risk of medication-associated adverse events, often due to weight-based dosing errors. We aimed to reduce the proportion of medications that were administered where the dosing weight was >= 10% different from the recorded weight. Methods: We adopted in-situ usability testing to iteratively improve design of clinical decision support that would enable accurate dosing weight documentation by prompting clinicians to update weight if recorded weight was > 10% different and it had been at least 7 days since the last dosing weight update. Results: The proportion of medication administrations with difference >10% between their recorded weight and dosing weight decreased from 13.1% (56,256/ 429,006) in the baseline period to 9.5% (35,560 / 372,443) in the intervention period (P < 0.001). Discussion and Conclusion: User-centered design of an interruptive alert improved the accuracy of dosing weights during medication administrations without substantial alert burden. In-situ usability testing is an effective approach to rapidly obtain feedback from frontline users and iterate on the design to effect desired behavior changes

AB  - Background: Medication discrepancies, which are a threat to patient safety, can be reduced by medication reconciliation (MedRec). MedRec is a complex process that can be supported by the use of information technology and patient engagement. Therefore, the SEAMPAT project aims to develop a MedRec IT platform based on two applications. The application for the professionals is called: the "MedRec app".
   Objective: In the present study, we aimed to describe the development and usability testing of the MedRec app, reporting results of a three iterations user-centered usability evaluation.
   Methods: We used a three phase iterative user-centered study spread over 16 months. At each phase, the usability evaluation included several methods (observations, questionnaires, and follow-up discussions with participants) to collect quantitative and qualitative data in order to improve the current prototype and evolve to the next prototype.
   Results: In total, 48 healthcare professionals (25 general practitioners and 23 hospital clinicians) participated to the MedRec app evaluation. There were 14, 32 and 5 participants for phases 1, 2 and 3 respectively. At each phase, many design modifications were done to strengthen usability. Concerning usability, participants considered the prototypes as an acceptable interface with a median System Usability Score of 73 at phase 2 and 75 at phase 3. Participants emphasized the need for improvements concerning workflow integration, usefulness and interoperability.
   Conclusion: The MedRec app was perceived as being useful, usable and satisfying. However, further improvements are required in several usability aspects. Our study demonstrates the importance of conducting usability assessments before investing time and resources in a large study evaluating the effect of an eMedRec approach on clinical outcomes. Our findings may also increase the chances of acceptability and sustained use over time by clinicians.

AB  - Background: One in five U.S. adults lives with some kind of mental health condition and 4.6% of all U.S. adults have a serious mental illness. The Internet has become the first place for these people to seek online mental health information for help. However, online mental health information is not well-organized and often of low quality. There have been efforts in building evidence-based mental health knowledgebases curated with information manually extracted from the high-quality scientific literature. Manual extraction is inefficient. Crowdsourcing can potentially be a low-cost mechanism to collect labeled data from non-expert laypeople. However, there is not an existing annotation tool integrated with popular crowdsourcing platforms to perform the information extraction tasks. In our previous work, we prototyped a Semantic Text Annotation Tool (STAT) to address this gap.
   Objective: We aimed to refine the STAT prototype (1) to improve its usability and (2) to enhance the crowdsourcing workflow efficiency to facilitate the construction of evidence-based mental health knowledgebase, following a user-centered design (UCD) approach.
   Methods: Following UCD principles, we conducted four design iterations to improve the initial STAT prototype. In the first two iterations, usability testing focus groups were conducted internally with 8 participants recruited from a convenient sample, and the usability was evaluated with a modified System Usability Scale (SUS). In the following two iterations, usability testing was conducted externally using the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform. In each iteration, we summarized the usability testing results through thematic analysis, identified usability issues, and conducted a heuristic evaluation to map identified usability issues to Jakob Nielsen's usability heuristics. We collected suggested improvements in the usability testing sessions and enhanced STAT accordingly in the next UCD iteration. After four UCD iterations, we conducted a case study of the system on MTurk using mental health related scientific literature. We compared the performance of crowdsourcing workers with two expert annotators from two aspects: efficiency and quality.
   Results: The SUS score increased from 70.3 +/- 12.5 to 81.1 +/- 9.8 after the two internal UCD iterations as we improved STAT' s functionality based on the suggested improvements. We then evaluated STAT externally through MTurk in the following two iterations. The SUS score decreased to 55.7 +/- 20.1 in the third iteration, probably because of the complexity of the tasks. After further simplification of STAT and the annotation tasks with an improved annotation guideline, the SUS score increased to 73.8 +/- 13.8 in the fourth iteration of UCD. In the evaluation case study, on average, the workers spent 125.5 +/- 69.2 s on the onboarding tutorial and the crowdsourcing workers spent significantly less time on the annotation tasks compared to the two experts. In terms of annotation quality, the workers' annotation results achieved average Fl-scores ranged from 0.62 to 0.84 for the different sentences.
   Conclusions: We successfully developed a web-based semantic text annotation tool, STAT, to facilitate the curation of semantic web knowledgebases through four UCD iterations. The lessons learned from the UCD process could serve as a guide to further enhance STAT and the development and design of other crowdsourcing-based semantic text annotation tasks. Our study also showed that a well-organized, informative annotation guideline is as important as the annotation tool itself. Further, we learned that a crowdsourcing task should consist of multiple simple microtasks rather than a complicated task.

AB  - Many individuals who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing (DHH) in the U.S. have lower English language literacy levels than their hearing peers, which creates a barrier to access web content for these users. In the present study we determine a usable interface experience for authoring sentences (or multi-sentence messages) in ASL (American Sign Language) using the EMBR (Embodied Agents Behavior Realizer) animation platform. Three rounds of iterative designs were produced through participatory design techniques and usability testing, to refine the design, based on feedback from 8 participants familiar with creating ASL animations. Later, a usability testing session was conducted with four participants on the final iteration of the designs. We found that participants expressed a preference for a "timeline" layout for arranging words to create a sentence, with a dual view of the word-level and the sub-word "pose" level. This paper presents the details of the design stages of the new GUI, the results, and directions for future work.

AB  - Dekoruma is an Indonesia-based home and living e-Commerce with an urgency to improve the quality of service and shopping experience for its customers. This study is conducted to evaluate usability aspects of Dekoruma's current e-Commerce site and propose an alternative design to improve the usability. The methods used for data collection and analysis in this study are the mixed method approach, and the alternative design development is conducted using the User-Centered Design (UCD) approach. The quantitative data are collected through online questionnaires addressing users' demographic data and behavior in using Dekoruma website and System Usability Scale. Usability testing is conducted to collect qualitative data directly from end-users. Identified usability problems are mapped to relate interface design principles. Proposed solutions are built into a high fidelity prototype as the end result. The usability testing of the alternative design shows that most of the proposed solutions are able to solve usability problems encountered beforehand. Further improvement is still needed on product filter and product detail features.

AB  - Among the unique challenges faced by nursing homes is poor communication and notification. An analysis of the work system showed that a mobile device-based system that rely less on auditory display is promising. We proposed a smartwatch interface as part of communication and notification system for nursing homes. A user-centered design approach was adopted in the design and evaluation of the interface. The application integrates call light system, chair and bed alarms, wander guard, and calling for help functions and uses multi-modal interfaces to provide informative alarms for nursing home staff. Through a process of iterative testing and refinement with prospective users (through cognitive walkthrough, heuristic evaluation and usability testing of low-fidelity prototypes), a final design was well received by nursing experts in geriatric care and at local nursing homes. The effects of the system will be tested in the future using a high-fidelity prototype through simulation experiment.

AB  - In this project, an online escape game for older adults was developed collaboratively with five novice developers and 12 older adults who tested the prototype game at several stages of the development process. We followed a User-Centered Design (UCD) process to develop the game. During the design process, older adults tested the game and it was refined based on their feedback and the research team's observation of their play. We found that incorporating older adults into the design process significantly improved the design, as they provided insights that would not have been available otherwise. We also concluded that the older adults' involvement in the design process could make the game better tailored to their needs. The game is currently being field-tested.

KW  - PERFORMANCE
AB  - This study aimed to apply gesture-based cognition learning technology to develop an educational training support system (G-NETS) for physical assessment practicum. The processes of G-NETS system development can be divided into two stages: user-centered design (UCD) development and system verification. Eventually, the quantitative and qualitative analysis is conducted to evaluate nursing students learning performance, attitude, cognitive load, and technology acceptance. Results reveal that G-NETS can help the clinical nursing instructors to access the learners' information easily, to monitor the student's learning behavior in clinical courses, and to give them timely support and feed-backs accordingly. That in turn can reduce the percentage of mistakes and increase the quality of clinical practicum learning process. In the future, this study can be applied to clinical education, the training of new clinical nursing staff, other subjects of clinical practicum training, which expand the beneficial results of practical training and clinical teaching.

AB  - The study examines the cumulative impact of factors that affect usability testing for user-centered web design, namely the so-called 'contextual fidelity model' factors that include product properties, task features, user traits, and environment/context factors. Today, the design, user experience and usability (DUXU) research experiences a lack of studies that would assess combinatorial, rather than individual, effects of these factors upon user performance. We address this gap by seeing both independent factors and the resulting user states as complex and dynamic, and testing the combined impact of aesthetic quality of websites, user traits, and individual/group experiment settings upon formation of two dysfunctional user states that critically affect user performance, namely monotony and anxiety. We develop a research design that allows for assessing the combinatorial effects in formation of user dysfunctionality. For that, we conduct a study with 80 assessors of Russian/European and Chinese origin in individual/group setting, employing two types of tasks and websites of high/low aesthetic quality. As the results of our experiment show, group task solving enhances the synchronous impact of website aesthetics and task features upon user states. Interaction of high-quality design, group environment, and monotonous tasks provides for an antagonistic effect when aesthetic layout in a group environment significantly reduces the fatigue rate. Low aesthetic quality in a group environment leads to cumulative enhancing of dysfunctionality for both monotony and anxiety. We conclude by setting questions and prospects for further research.

AB  - Existing virtual reality (VR) street view and 360-degree road view applications often rely on complex controllers or touch interfaces, which can hinder user immersion and accessibility. These challenges are particularly pronounced for under-represented populations, such as older adults and individuals with limited familiarity with digital devices. Such groups frequently face physical or environmental constraints that restrict their ability to engage in outdoor activities, highlighting the need for alternative methods of experiencing the world through virtual environments. To address this issue, we propose a VR street view application featuring an intuitive, gesture-based interface designed to simplify user interaction and enhance accessibility for socially disadvantaged individuals. Our approach seeks to optimize digital accessibility by reducing barriers to entry, increasing user immersion, and facilitating a more inclusive virtual exploration experience. Through usability testing and iterative design, this study evaluates the effectiveness of gesture-based interactions in improving accessibility and engagement. The findings emphasize the importance of user-centered design in fostering an inclusive VR environment that accommodates diverse needs and abilities.

AB  - Technological innovation has increasingly become important in addressing the most pressing problems in society. To create better and sustainable solutions, project teams often strive to bring the people they are designed for to the innovation process. While the human-centered design approach has become popular in guiding design in the private sector, its place in addressing larger challenges beyond human needs is still not well defined. Using our experiences in designing the WasteWATER app, an open-source decision making tool intended to help design sustainable water reclamation systems, we illustrate the synergy between analytical research and human-centered design, through the convergence of design and anthropology in creating applied outcomes in universities. Analytical research can help understand complex problems such as the sustainability of water reclamation. At the same time, embedding design thinking in applied research projects can help researchers in academic institutions refine their solutions through collaborative and iterative design with stakeholders.

AB  - There are a lot of growing e-Commerce companies in Indonesia with their own application that has been used by millions of users. One of the important informational channels in e-Commerce application is push notifications, of which its sole purpose is to push and deliver information to its users. The problem is that only a limited number of customers open push notifications immediately upon receiving. This research was conducted to find the key factors that determine user's desires to open push notification and to improve user's experiences when receiving push notifications. User-Centered Design and a mixed-method approach were used on this research, utilizing surveys and contextual interviews for data collection. Tokopedia is one of e-Commerce companies in Indonesia. Tokopedia iOS application is used in this research as a case study as Tokopedia is one of the most used e-Commerce application in Indonesia. The research findings show that the key determining factors are contents of the push notifications and time and frequency of receipt. Based on the results, a prototype has been designed in a high-fidelity form and was subsequently evaluated using the Usability Testing method. The evaluation show that the task success rate of said prototype is 88.3 percent, and accordingly it could be the solution to this problems.

AB  - One of the more demanding aspects of formal evaluations in user-centered system design is the underlying requirement for an experimental platform that accurately reflects the functionality being tested and captures relevant user performance data. While we are unaware of any truly turn-key solutions for avoiding many of the inherent costs associated with the iterative cycle of user-centered system development and formal testing, in our mediated multitasking research, we have found that a multi-application host environment, instrumented for user tracking and a playback function for reviewing what individuals attended to, experienced, and did during the task-performance segments of interaction studies, could be implemented as a reusable infrastructure of services and control functions. In this short paper, we introduce the Testbed Framework System, a flexible and extensible software platform for use in the development and conduct of formal usability testing, and outline a number of its core functions and capabilities.

AB  - Objective: Medication reconciliation (MedRec) can improve patient safety by resolving medication discrepancies. Because information technology (IT) and patient engagement are promising approaches to optimizing MedRec, the SEAMPAT project aims to develop a MedRec IT platform based on two applications: the "patient app" and the "MedRec app." This study evaluates three dimensions of the usability (efficiency, satisfaction, and effectiveness) and usefulness of the patient app.
   Methods: We performed a four-month user-centered observational study. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Participants completed the system usability scale (SUS) questionnaire and a second questionnaire on usefulness. Effectiveness was assessed by measuring the completeness of the medication list generated by the patient application and its correctness (ie medication discrepancies between the patient list and the best possible medication history). Qualitative data were collected from semi-structured interviews, observations and comments, and questions raised by patients.
   Results: Forty-two patients completed the study. Sixty-nine percent of patients considered the patient app to be acceptable (SUS Score >= 70) and usefulness was high. The medication list was complete for a quarter of the patients (7/28) and there was a discrepancy for 21.7% of medications (21/97). The qualitative data enabled the identification of several barriers (related to functional and non-functional aspects) to the optimization of usability and usefulness.
   Conclusions: Our findings highlight the importance and value of user-centered usability testing of a patient application implemented in "real-world" conditions. To achieve adoption and sustained use by patients, the app should meet patients' needs while also efficiently improving the quality of MedRec.

AB  - Incorporating emotional design, user-centered design, music education insights, and cognitive load management, this study investigates the integration of AI into cello learning. Through competitive analysis and qualitative user research, including detailed observations and interviews, we introduce interaction design solutions of "Goal-Oriented Three Practice Modes", "Interactive Learning", and "Personalized Practice Plans". This research aims to make classical music education more efficient, accessible and personalized, addressing economic and geographical limitations. By integrating technological innovations, we seek to enrich the classical music tradition, enhance the cello learning experience, and expand the community for cello learners and enthusiasts.

AB  - We implemented a user-centered approach to the design of an artificial intelligence (AI) system that provides users with access to information about the workings of the United States federal court system regardless of their technical background. Presently, most of the records associated with the federal judiciary are provided through a federal system that does not support exploration aimed at discovering systematic patterns about court activities. In addition, many users lack the data analytical skills necessary to conduct their own analyses and convert data into information. We conducted interviews, observations, and surveys to uncover the needs of our users and discuss the development of an intuitive platform informed from these needs that makes it possible for legal scholars, lawyers, and journalists to discover answers to more advanced questions about the federal court system. We report on results from usability testing and discuss design implications for AI and law practitioners and researchers.

AB  - Many elderly people are living apart from their children. We want to develop a system that can reinforce the connection and emotional feelings between aged parents and their children by combing new digital technologies with soft and warm leather material. Through an iterative design process that includes user interview and observation, design exploration, low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes, and usability testing, we present a small digital screen attached to an existing leather wallet of the aged parent to receive and display pictures or videos sent from their adult children. By attaching LINK, the old leather wallet serves as an invisible channel, sharing and connecting beautiful family memories without interrupting the private life of either side.

AB  - Preventable medical errors in hospitals are the third leading cause of death in the United States. Many of these are caused by poor situational awareness, especially in acute care resuscitation scenarios. While a number of checklists and technological interventions have been developed to reduce cognitive load and improve situational awareness, these tools often do not fit the clinical workflow. To better understand the challenges faced by clinicians in acute care codes, we conducted a qualitative study with interprofessional clinicians at three regional hospitals. Our key findings are: Current documentation processes are inadequate (with information recorded on paper towels); reference guides can serve as fixation points, reducing rather than enhancing situational awareness; the physical environment imposes significant constraints on workflow; homegrown solutions may be used often to solve unstandardized processes; simulation scenarios do not match real-world practice. We present a number of considerations for collaborative healthcare technology design and discuss the implications of our findings on current work for the development of more effective interventions for acute care resuscitation scenarios.

AB  - There is a rapid increase in the use of Extended Reality (XR) based simulators for surgical training. Researchers have developed XR-based simulators for various surgical fields such as laparoscopic surgery, brain surgery, and eye surgery, among others. However, there is a lack of effort in developing a holistic framework to support the creation of such XR-based simulators. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the need for a framework by integration of various elements such as Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), participatory design, information modeling, and computational approaches to support the creation of XR-based simulators. A detailed survey of the current state of the art for the development of XR-based simulators is presented in this paper followed by the gap in the current research. The need for a framework based on the current gap is also showcased in the paper. Finally, the proposed Human eXtended Reality Interaction (HXRI) framework for the creation of XR-based training environments for surgical contexts is discussed.

AB  - This study introduces the Eye-tracking Translation Software (ETS), a system that leverages eye-tracking data and real-time translation to enhance reading flow for non-native language users in complex, technical texts. By measuring the fixation duration, we can detect moments of cognitive load, ETS selectively provides translations, maintaining reading flow and engagement without undermining language learning. The key technological components include a desktop eye-tracker integrated with a custom Python-based application. Through a user-centered design, ETS dynamically adapts to individual reading needs, reducing cognitive strain by offering word-level translations when needed. A study involving 53 participants assessed ETS's impact on reading speed, fixation duration, and user experience, with findings indicating improved comprehension and reading efficiency. Results demonstrated that gaze-based adaptations significantly improved their reading experience and reduced cognitive load. Participants positively rated ETS's usability and were noted through preferences for customization, such as pop-up placement and sentence-level translations. Future work will integrate AI-driven adaptations, allowing the system to adjust based on user proficiency and reading behavior. The study contributes to the growing evidence of eye-tracking's potential in educational and professional applications, offering a flexible, personalized approach to reading assistance that balances language exposure with real-time support.

AB  - This paper emphasizes the significance of employing methodological approaches rooted in participatory design to facilitate intergenerational collaboration in an age range less studied (generations X to Y) in developing a web-based newsroom for young people. The research stems from the YouNDigital project, funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, which seeks to explore young people's interaction with news in a digitized society. A key output of the project is the development of the YouNDigital Newsroom, aweb-based platform enabling youth from diverse backgrounds to share their views of the world on issues that matter to them. Drawing upon intergenerational collaboration and knowledge transfer, this paper explores the challenges and strategies in creating a platform that reflects researchers' and users' diverse perspectives and needs.
   Through co-design sessions, iterative prototyping, and usability testing, the task navigated complexities within a limited timeframe and resources to foster user engagement and ownership.
   The main objective was to engage users with a web-based Newsroom to generate meaningful content that reflects their perspectives on matters of interest. The design thinking sessions and continuous collaborative work were instrumental in defining potential user profiles (personas) and delineating usage contexts for each persona. The findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse perspectives and collaborative design methodologies in addressing multifaceted challenges and creating inclusive solutions across generations. Leveraging design methodologies facilitated collaboration between researchers and users in developing the YouNDigital newsroom. By incorporating user perspectives from the outset, the project aimed to create a platform that resonates with young people and researchers from different generations' interests and fosters meaningful engagement with news content in a digital era.

AB  - This paper presents the design and implementation of BL.MIXEDR, a maintenance assistance system that leverages the capabilities of augmented reality (AR) to support technicians during maintenance processes. BL.MIXEDR reimagines the work order to fully exploit the contextualization of numerical data and maintenance management information using the hands-free and spatial capabilities of augmented reality headsets. The prototype supports technicians with relevant information, at the right moment and at the right location allowing them to focus solely on the maintenance work, thus, reducing extraneous cognitive load and improving their performances. Moreover, the architecture of the BL.MIXEDR system allows a simplified integration with existing maintenance systems, which, in our view, is one of the barriers to industrial adoption of AR maintenance systems. BL.MIXEDR is the result of several iterations of user-centered design and multiple evaluations by maintenance experts in real conditions on the field.

AB  - In this paper, we present a data-driven approach to enable the creation of evidence-based usability test scenarios. By utilising product usage data to create usability test scenarios, we aim to improve the reliability of the test results and to provide better insights into product usability. The approach consists of four elements: the collection of product usage data, the transformation of these data into logs of user activities, the creation of models of user behaviour, and the guided creation of usability test scenarios based on the models. We discuss the challenges that can be encountered when applying this approach based on our experiences with two case studies in product development. We have created a prototype scenario planning tool and performed a preliminary evaluation of the tool with usability engineers working at Philips Healthcare. The evaluation shows that tool-supported evidence-based usability test creation would be valuable in their daily work.

AB  - Immigrant populations with limited English proficiency (LEP) confront more challenges than those with English proficiency in using healthcare technology in the U.S. Our case study, conducted in collaboration with the Immigrant Health and Cancer Disparities (IHCD) Center at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), explores howLEP patients interact with patient portals translated in their preferred language. Through semi-structured interviews and usability testing, we found that individuals with LEP 1) encounter usability barriers during patient portal enrollment, 2) perceive increased self-efficacy and trust in using translated patient portals, and 3) greatly depend on caregivers for patient-provider communication and use of patient portals without translations. Based on these results, we offer recommendations for enhancing patient portal adoption among patients with LEP, share insights gained from applying User-Centered Design ( UCD) methodologies with this user group, and discuss opportunities for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research to empower this user group and mitigate health disparities.

AB  - Online courses in continuing education often entail a self-paced format, resulting in high levels of autonomy for adult learners. This autonomy, however, requires learners to self-regulate their learning process. Research has shown that self-regulated learning (SRL) in online courses can be challenging, and support might therefore be needed. While there is evidence that adaptive support systems can improve students' SRL in formal school and higher education settings, little is known about adaptive SRL support in continuing education online courses. The present paper addresses this research gap applying a design-based research approach. First, we re-analyzed an existing dataset that comprises survey data of 60 adult learners from four course iterations and matched survey measures on learning processes with learners' perceptions of their SRL strategy use. The analyses revealed that adult learners especially struggled with structuring their learning environment and managing learning time. Based on these findings, adaptive support features were iteratively designed to address the identified challenges. We developed a course overview, an adaptive learning-time display, and adaptive highlighting of recommended content. Second, we investigated learners' perceptions of the design and functionality of these features by means of interactive co-design sessions. Finally, initial usability testing with students was conducted.

AB  - With the development of technology, there are advances that help civilizations on their day-to-day activities, one of which is the implementation of e-Learning on the Final Exams. A standardized national computer- based final examination in Indonesia is called Ujian Nasional Berbasis Komputer ( UNBK). Despite the fact that UNBK has been held nationwide since 2016, its interface and system have only gone through minor improvement throughout the years. To improve the usability and interface of UNBK, it is necessary to first evaluate the current interface from the users. The user evaluation was conducted using a mixed-method approach to compare and/or relate qualitative data and quantitative data. The user evaluation using an online questionnaire with the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) shows that UNBK's quality only exceeds in System Quality with a score of 75.71 out of 100. The online questionnaire data is supported with the qualitative data of contextual interviews, resulting in an affinity diagram to observe users' needs, pain points, and missing opportunities. The improved interface design according to the users' feedbacks was also tested using Usability Testing. The result of the UT shows that it has the binary task succession rate of 86.50%.

AB  - Indonesia is the second largest food waste producer country in the world after Saudi Arabia. This condition is very worrying because food waste could impact on many aspects of people's life including food security, economy and environment. One of the approaches to solve this problem is to make mobile application to change human consumption behavior. It was also found that majority of interaction designs for sustainable food consumption practices are not yet fully using behavior change theory (BCT) as a basis design decision making so that it cannot be ascertained the resulting design intervention can influence user behavior. Fogg Behavior Model (FBM) Theory provides an explanation regarding what factors can be used to change human behavior. This project aims to apply FBM theory to the development of application interaction design for reducing household food waste with user-centered design (UCD) approach that has been adapted. Low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototyping are also used in solution design stage of UCD. Output from this project is high-fidelity prototype of Spoonful with usability goals effective to use, easy to learn, and user experience goals helpful. Each of goals are measured with usability testing using task completion rate, Single Ease Question (SEQ) and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) value/usefulness subscale. System Usability Scale (SUS) and self-evaluation of the theory of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) are also used for testing on overall usability and behavior change. The results show that the prototype is effective to use with success rate 94.3%, easy to learn with SEQ score 6.12 out of 7, helpful with IMI score for the value/usefulness subscale score of 6.59 out of 7, grade C acceptable with SUS score 74.58 out of 100 and help people to move to action stage from preparation stage with self-evaluation of TTM theory score 71.83 out of 80. FBM theory is very helpful and proven to provide better design justification for behavior change.

AB  - Electroencephalography is well-known for its importance in the diagnosis and treatment of mental and neurological disorders and abnormalities, being especially noted in critically ill patients who suffer a variety of cerebral injuries and altered states of consciousness. However, there is an important lack of adapted equipment and applications designed to suit the clinical and research needs. Hence, patients, physicians and researchers suffer, in most cases, from a restricted mobility due to non-portable devices and wires which keep them attached to the bed, leading to an uncomfortable patient experience or difficulties during the recording. In addition, nowadays, both physicians and researchers need to access the recordings and patient information from different places such as different units or hospitals. To solve this problem, this paper presents the design and evaluation of the high-fidelity prototype of a wireless EEG smartphone application based on a user-centred design, including expert panel guidance, paper and high-fidelity prototyping and usability testing, which confirm the accuracy of the defined context of use and the validity of the prototyped application to suit the clinical and research needs. In fact, since the EEG is the most efficient and specific way to define the epileptogenic cortex, we will focus on the possible use of the presented App in epilepsy diagnosis, which is one of the main targets in the field.

AB  - This study aims to describe the prototype development and testing of a serious game designed for Brazilian children with diabetes. Following an approach of user-centered design, the researchers assessed game's preferences and diabetes learning needs to develop a Paper Prototype. The gameplay strategies included diabetes pathophysiology, self-care tasks, glycemic management, and food group learning. Diabetes and technology experts (n = 12) tested the prototype during audio-recorded sessions. Next, they answered a survey to evaluate the content, organization, presentation, and educational game aspects. The prototype showed a high content validity ratio (0.80), with three items not achieving the critical values (0.66). Experts recommended improving the game content and food illustrations. This evaluation contributed to the medium-fidelity prototype version, which after testing with diabetes experts (n = 12) achieved high content validity values (0.88). One item did not meet the critical values. Experts suggested increasing the options of outdoor activities and meals. Researchers also observed and video-recorded children with diabetes (n = 5) playing the game with satisfactory interaction. They considered the game enjoyable. The interdisciplinary team plays an important role guiding the designers in the use of theories and real needs of children. Prototypes are a low-cost usability and a successful method for evaluating games.

AB  - Authoring and editing access control policy can be a complex and cognitive demanding task, especially when dealing with a large number of rules and attributes. Visualisation techniques are known to be helpful to users analysing intricate data, and can, in some contexts, help decreasing the cognitive load. In this paper, we propose a new tool, VisABAC, which enables the visualisation of attribute based access control policies using the Circle Packing method. We used a participatory design, following a survey of existing visualisation methods in access control. VisABAC is designed as a web-page component, developed in Javascript using the D3.js library, and as such is easily usable without requiring any particular setup. In addition to presenting VisABAC, we demonstrate its usability by conducting a controlled experiment with 32 participants, asking them to change some attribute values in order to obtain a given decision for a policy, and measuring the time taken by participants to conduct these tasks (the faster, the better). We show a small to medium effect size (d = 0.44), thus indicating that VisABAC is a promising tool for authoring and editing access control policies.

AB  - Diabetes prevalence has steadily been increasing over the last decades and is expected to continue in this trajectory. Diary keeping is considered the central part of any successful therapy. Since paper-based diary keeping is often poor and electronic diaries often challenging for elderly users, we developed Diabetto. Using focus groups and interviews we analyzed the requirements for Diabetto. It uses a LiveScribe Echo pen as a replacement for a regular pen in traditional paper-based diary keeping, while at the same time adds interactive therapy support and access to a nutrition database through pen-input and text-to-speech. By enhancing an already familiar process we managed to achieve a high acceptance of the device. In an experimental evaluation using an extended TAM model we analyzed the influence of user-diversity factors on the acceptance. Interestingly typical predictors of acceptance, such as efficiency during use, did not influence ease of use, indicating that the digital pen might not be perceived as computerized technology.

AB  - Collaboration is a complex process that involves human and non-human factors. Although technology has improved and facilitated collaborative projects, interpretation, as the process of discovering and creating meaning, is often perceived as an individual act. This research aims to facilitate collaboration by better understanding how groups of people can make and maintain multiple interpretations. After a series of more than two dozen prototypes and 40 workshops for co-design and usability testing, the video records of the workshops have been categorized using protocol analysis and the foundations of discourse analysis. We hypothesize that the physical 3D aspect of these prototypes helps users not only in sharing their interpretations but also in co-creating them. Moreover, this is an essential finding for the next steps of this research, which will try to replicate the results of the physical models by attaching them as an interface to an online environment.

AB  - Children with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) are required to manage their illness to alleviate further long-term complications. Although children are expected to engage in appropriate self-management activities once they become older, many of the children remain passive actors in managing their condition. Due to the lack of knowledge and skills, as well as changes in parent-child relationships, children demonstrate low self-care adherence. Consequently, parents also face difficulties in defining their role in long-term care. This study, part of a larger study, comprised of three phases: mobile app development, prototype feasibility testing, and usability testing with child-parent dyads users. As part of the third phase, this study used qualitative interviews with 24 child-parent dyads to understand the existing facilitators and barriers in using the app. Our findings suggest that users found that the app reminded them to track their blood glucose (BG) values and facilitated child-parent communication in a user-friendly manner. By capturing the emerging themes in adopting the app from the children's perspective, we will iteratively refine the app to better suit the users' requirements.

AB  - Software development methods have been evolved to enable producing usable systems rapidly while considering all requirements. Several studies have focused on the need to balance between rapid development and capturing requirements related to user experience and business workflow. This balance has become more urging during COVID19 because many businesses want to quickly transfer to usable electronic systems that are accurate, efficient, easy to learn, satisfy users and support remote work. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework by integrating Rapid Application Development (RAD) method with Participatory Design (PD) method for enabling rapid production of usable systems. Both RAD and PD consist of design stages that can overlap and generate new phases where users participate in the design process and accelerate the production. Five usability tests are also added to the framework to validate the usability of the design at all stages. The Action Research method is used to assess the framework empirically in a context of an urgent need to an electronic system, and qualitative data analyses were conducted. The results show that the framework can be adopted by software companies because it satisfies the requirements of adopting software development methods. Also, the system developed using the framework is usable. The paper concludes that COVID19 affects software development by emphasizing rapid development while maintaining workflow. Also, using video conference for remote design assists in meeting users more frequently and in creating concise requirement documentation.

AB  - Objective: To design and evaluate an interactive data quality (DQ) characterization tool focused on fitness-for-use completeness measures to support researchers' assessment of a dataset.
   Materials and Methods: Design requirements were identified through a conceptual framework on DQ, literature review, and interviews. The prototype of the tool was developed based on the requirements gathered and was further refined by domain experts. The Fitness-for-Use Tool was evaluated through a within-subjects controlled experiment comparing it with a baseline tool that provides information on missing data based on intrinsic DQ measures. The tools were evaluated on task performance and perceived usability.
   Results: The Fitness-for-Use Tool allows users to define data completeness by customizing the measures and its thresholds to fit their research task and provides a data summary based on the customized definition. Using the Fitness-for-Use Tool, study participants were able to accurately complete fitness-for-use assessment in less time than when using the Intrinsic DQ Tool. The study participants perceived that the Fitness-for-Use Tool was more useful in determining the fitness-for-use of a dataset than the Intrinsic DQ Tool.
   Discussion: Incorporating fitness-for-use measures in a DQ characterization tool could provide data summary that meets researchers needs. The design features identified in this study has potential to be applied to other biomedical data types.
   Conclusion: A tool that summarizes a dataset in terms of fitness-for-use dimensions and measures specific to a research question supports dataset assessment better than a tool that only presents information on intrinsic DQ measures.

AB  - Online learning ' s popularity has surged. However, teachers face the challenge of the lack of non-verbal communication with students, making it difficult to perceive their learning-centered affective states (LCAS), leading to missed intervention opportunities. Addressing this challenge requires a system that detects students ' LCAS from their non-verbal cues and informs teachers in an actionable way. To design such a system, it is essential to explore field experts' needs and requirements. Therefore, we conducted design-based research focus groups with teachers to determine which LCAS they find important to know during online lectures and their preferred communication methods. The results indicated that confusion, engagement, boredom, frustration, and curiosity are the most important LCAS and that the proposed system should take into account teachers' cognitive load and give them autonomy in the choice of content and frequency of the information. Considering the obtained feedback, a prototype of two versions was developed. The prototype was evaluated by teachers utilizing the System Usability Scale (SUS). Results indicated an average SUS score of 80.5 and 74.5 for each version, suggesting acceptable usability. These findings can guide the design and development of a system that can help teachers recognize students ' LCAS, thus improving synchronous online learning.

AB  - Objective Most electronic health records display historical medication information only in a data table or clinician notes. We designed a medication timeline visualization intended to improve ease of use, speed, and accuracy in the ambulatory care of chronic disease.
   Materials and Methods We identified information needs for understanding a patient medication history, then applied human factors and interaction design principles to support that process. After research and analysis of existing medication lists and timelines to guide initial requirements, we hosted design workshops with multidisciplinary stakeholders to expand on our initial concepts. Subsequent core team meetings used an iterative user-centered design approach to refine our prototype. Finally, a small pilot evaluation of the design was conducted with practicing physicians.
   Results We propose an open-source online prototype that incorporates user feedback from initial design workshops, and broad multidisciplinary audience feedback. We describe the applicable design principles associated with each of the prototype's key features. A pilot evaluation of the design showed improved physician performance in 5 common medication-related tasks, compared to tabular presentation of the same information.
   Discussion There is industry interest in developing medication timelines based on the example prototype concepts. An open, standards-based technology platform could enable developers to create a medication timeline that could be deployable across any compatible health IT application.
   Conclusion The design goal was to improve physician understanding of a patient's complex medication history, using a medication timeline visualization. Such a design could reduce temporal and cognitive load on physicians for improved and safer care.

AB  - Massively Multiplayer Online Role-playing Games (MMORPGs) feature a large number of players socially interacting with one another in an immersive gaming environment. A successful MMORPG should engage players and meet their needs to achieve different cate-gories of gratifications. Research on the evolution of player social interaction network and the dynamics of inter-player intimacy could provide insights into players' gratification-oriented behaviors in MMORPGs. Such understanding could in turn guide game designs for better engaging existing players and marketing strategies for attracting newcomers. Conventional dynamic network analysis may help investigate game-based social interactions at the macroscopic level. However, current dynamic network visualization techniques mainly focus on illustrating topological changes of the entire network, which are unsuitable for analyzing player-specific social interactions in the virtual world from an egocentric perspective. In general, game designers and operators find it difficult to analyze the way players with different gratification needs may interact with one another and the consequences on their relationships with direct ties, using a decentralized social graph with complicated time-varying structures. In this paper, we present MMOSeer, a visual analytics system for exploring the evolution of egocentric player intimacy network. MMOSeer focuses on the relationship between a player (ego) and his/her directly-linked friends (alters). We follow a user-centered design process to develop the system with game analysts and apply novel visualization techniques in conjunction with well-established algorithms to depict the evolution of intimacy egocentric network. We also derive a centrality change metric to infer how the impact of changes in an ego's interactive behaviors may propagate through the intimacy network, reshaping the structure of the alters' social circles at both micro and macro levels. Finally, we validate the usability of MMOSeer by discovering different user interaction patterns and the corresponding ego-network structural changes in a real-world gameplay dataset from a commercial MMORPG.

AB  - Objective Lung transplant (LTx) saves lives in cystic fibrosis (CF). However, many potential candidates express uncertainty about LTx and die before receiving this treatment. CF guidelines recommend LTx education and clinical discussions well before the need for LTx arises, but limited patient resources exist. Materials and Methods We engaged people with CF and CF physicians in human-centered design of "Take On Transplant" (TOT), a web-based education tool to prepare patients for LTx discussions. Across 3 phases, needs assessment, design groups, and iterative user testing of TOT, we refined TOT from wireframe prototypes, to an interactive website, to a fully functional intervention ready for clinical trials. Results Fifty-five people with CF and 105 physicians identified information needs to prepare for LTx discussions. Design groups (n = 14 participants) then established core requirements: didactic education ("Resource Library"), patient narratives ("CF Stories"), frequently asked questions ("FAQ"), and self-assessment to tailor content ("My CF Stage"). Iterative usability testing (n = 39) optimized the design of CF Stories and prototype layout. We then developed the TOT website and demonstrated feasibility and preliminary efficacy of use through 2-week field testing (n = 9). Discussion Our human-centered design process provided guidance for educational tools to serve the evolving needs of potential LTx candidates. Our findings support the process of patient deliberation as a foundation for shared decision-making in CF, and inform educational tools that could potentially translate beyond LTx. Conclusion TOT fills a critical gap in preparing people with CF for shared decision-making about LTx and may serve as a model for educational tools for other preference-sensitive decisions.

AB  - Government websites serve as sources of information and services related to public affairs, playing an essential role in connecting citizens with government institutions. The responsibility of government websites extends beyond just providing information; they must ensure that the information is easily accessible and understandable. This paper analyzes and redesigns the United States Department of Labor's website. The research began by examining user-generated content on social media and online forums, shedding light on user grievances and challenges. The analysis revealed a significant issue with the website's information architecture, causing users to need help finding the information they needed. A heuristic evaluation was conducted, and issues related to problems with usability heuristics, including "Help and documentation," "Visibility of system status," and "Aesthetic and minimalist design," were also identified. To initiate the redesign, a virtual card sorting activity engaged potential users to reorganize content and categories. User interface (UI) components were developed, presenting a fresh color palette aligned with the Department of Labor's branding. Remote Usability Testing (RUT) with seven diverse users, leading to further refinements for responsiveness and consistency. Usability tests on the prototypes demonstrated the value of a user-centric approach. If implemented on the United States government website, this redesign could alleviate user pain points, particularly information accessibility. In conclusion, optimizing government website information architecture is vital for improving user experience. This research and redesign process serves as a valuable case study for enhancing the usability of government online platforms, ultimately benefiting citizens and their interactions with government services.

AB  - Multi-step retrosynthetic route planning (MRRP) is the core task in synthetic chemistry, in which chemists recursively deconstruct a target molecule to find a set of reactants that make up the target. MRRP is challenging in that the search space is vast, and chemists are often lost in the process. Existing AI models can achieve automatic MRRP fast, but they only work on relatively simple targets, which leaves complex molecules under chemists' expertise. To facilitate MRRP of complex molecules, we proposed a human-AI collaborative system, RetroLens, through a participatory design process. AI can contribute by two approaches: joint action and algorithm-in-the-loop. Deconstruction steps are allocated to chemists or AI based on their capabilities and AI recommends candidate revision steps to fix problems along the way. A within-subjects study (N=18) showed that chemists who used RetroLens reported faster MRRP, broader design space exploration, higher confidence in their planning, and lower cognitive load.

AB  - Kinaesthetic creativity refers to the body's ability to generate alternate futures in activities such as role-playing in participatory design workshops. This has relevance not only to the design of methods for inspiring creativity but also to the design of systems that promote engaging experiences via bodily interaction. This paper probes this creative process by studying how dancers interact with technology to generate ideas. We developed a series of parameterized interactive visuals and asked dance practitioners to use them in generating movement materials. From our study, we define a taxonomy that comprises different relationships and movement responses dancers form with the visuals. Against this taxonomy, we describe six types of interaction patterns and demonstrate how dance creativity is driven by the ability to shift between these patterns. We then propose a set of interaction design qualities to support kinaesthetic creativity.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to provide a qualitative analysis of the end result of the design and implementation process of a vehicle pooling platform. It analyzes Creativity vs Knowledge interaction patterns in the innovation process under the four different perspectives proposed in the theoretical framework of the CKI model (Palmieri and Giglio, 2013; Palmieri and Giglio, 2014). It aims to identify determining factors and impacts of the technology platform at urban, regional or national level. This application of the CKI model is geared to prove how its comprehensive slant supports the design, monitoring and assessment of innovation plans.
   Design/methodology/approach - This work is based on a case study approach and on a qualitative research involving literature review activities. Its design is compliant with the theoretical framework of the CKI model in order to identify the aforementioned four perspectives and capture the outcomes of the innovation process for all possible stakeholders. It utilizes a mixed methodology consisting of a panel of experts, geared to perform a qualitative assessment of the magnitude of impacts of the entrepreneurial initiative, and the participation observation methodology, for a complementary analysis of interaction patterns throughout the process.
   Originality/value - The study proposes a very recent theoretical framework to analyze entrepreneurial initiatives with a broader perspective than the prevailing one in literature. Applying the CKI model to the case study at hand proves how deep can be the impacts of a start-up initiative and helps deepening the impacts of Creativity vs Knowledge interaction patterns at the initial stage of the innovation process. Moreover, it provides a hitherto unexplored methodological approach consisting of a complementary analysis of interaction patterns in innovation processes by mixing the participation observation and the panel of experts methodologies.
   Practical implications - The end result of this study shows the real-world impacts of such a research project focusing on the value creation for different stakeholders and the community as a whole. It deepens also how Creativity vs Knowledge dynamics play as determinants and affect the end result of the innovation process. This work includes also a methodology tool for scholars since it is endowed with two complementary approaches - i.e. participation observation and panel of experts. Finally, this paper provides scholars with the first guide about the application of the CKI in order to conduct similar studies in other contexts.

AB  - Green IT products collect personal small data by wearable computing and Quantified Self, Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Everything (IoE) link the small data with the big data, and transform the user experience from User-Centered Design (UCD) into User Participated (Involved or engagement) Design (UPD). To collect the seamless and sustainable UPD small data, we use the wearable computing sensors and applications for small data mining, filter, information visualization and interaction design. By information sorting the wearable computing into five types (in me, on me, with me, around me, beyond me), we intend to design the user experience in a sustainable way by Quantified Self. With the context awareness, conscious awareness and emotion awareness, we use LBS (location-based service) to construct context awareness, set up big five personalities and Enneagram to deal with the data of conscious awareness. For the Green IT Products, we set up the eco system information architecture and agile interaction model for the user experience design, we also use pre-conscious, subconscious and conscious awareness big data to analyze and predict the long-term impaction factors for the user experience and users' intuitive interaction. From the strategy level, structure level, framework level and visual level, we point out the Meaning-Centered Design methodology to dig out the user experience design for the Green IT Products, green and live information architecture for the life cycle evaluation for the Green IT products, figure out the stakeholder and interaction logic moving line by mapping the mental model for the diversified users' agile transformation needs, emotions and interaction feedback, provide the mass customization and crowds innovation contents to support the Green IT products and Product Service System (PSS), modify the quality of the real physical products and enrich the virtual reality digital information contents to prolong the life cycle of the Green IT Products. By decreasing the carbon footprint and increasing the three flows (information flow, logistics, financial flow) chain touchpoints, we find the painpoints and design the good user experience for the real people. We construct the user engagement innovation platform and transform the users' function with duality role player with user and designer. For the evaluation of the user experience, we change the scenario role player design into 'real design for real people', and with the agile interaction and intuitive interaction, we modify the user experience with the real time high-fidelity prototype and iterative usability testing. In the pilot study, we design the smart clothes and interactive stage, props to collect the dancer's small data about the heart-beat, EMG, EEG, motion, body gesture, emotion and the audience feedback such as the sound of clapping, the environment light change, the audience moving line and the air smog haze index. We use the module and separate design for the clothes and sensors, memory metal, fiber-optical to balance the clothes light change, clothes form transformation and small data visualization. On the one hand, the clothes can collect the dancer's action data in an active way, at the same time, the clothes also interact with the dancer, the audience and the stage environment to support the digital contents of the dance. One clothes can express the five scenes of the dance in a sustainable way.
   And because of the separate design, the clothes and the sensors play the role in a parallel way to leave the dancer plenty of free uncertainty expression space. That win-win design support the real and virtual parts life cycle for the Green IT Products. We use the expert review, heuristic evaluation, big data visual analytics and usability testing for the user experience design evaluation and design the third version for the smart clothes and interactive stage.

AB  - Background: General practitioners play a unique key role in diagnosing patients with unclear diseases. Decision support systems in primary care can assist with diagnosis provided that they are efficient and user-friendly. Objectives: The objective of this study is to develop a high-fidelity prototype of the user interface of a clinical decision support system for primary care, particularly for diagnosis support in unclear diseases, using expert inspections at an early stage of development to ensure a high level of usability. Methods: The user interface prototype was iteratively developed based on previous research, design principles, and usability guidelines. During the development phase, three usability inspections were carried out by all experts at four-week intervals as heuristic walkthrough. Each inspection consisted of two parts: 1) Task-based inspection 2) Free exploration and evaluation based on usability heuristics. Five domain experts assessed the current status of development. The tasks in the inspections were based on the task model derived in the requirements analysis: perform data entry, review and discuss results, schedule further diagnostics, refer to specialists and close case. Results: As a result of this iterative development, a high-fidelity, clickable user interface prototype was created that is able to fulfil all six tasks of our task model. The usability inspections identified a total of 196 usability issues (for all 3 inspections; Part 1: 90 issues, Part 2: 106 issues), ranging in severity from minor to severe. These served the continuous adjustment and improvement of the prototype. All main tasks were completed successfully despite these problems. Conclusion: Usability inspections through heuristic walkthroughs can support and optimise the development of a user-centred decision support system in order to ensure its suitability for performing relevant tasks.

AB  - The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) marks a significant milestone in innovations, particularly with the advent of Virtual Beings (VBs) and Mixed Reality. VBs have transitioned from rudimentary programmed characters to elaborate, interactive entities capable of sophisticated human engagement. Enhanced with emotional intelligence, adaptive learning, and context-sensitivity, VBs offer nuanced interactions within both digital and real-world settings. A key breakthrough in this field is the development of affective VBs, which possess the ability to comprehend and react to human emotions, challenging the traditional view of AI as emotionless and strictly logical. This evolution prompts a reexamination of AI's societal role and the dynamics of Human-Computer Interaction. This study focuses on the complexities of VBs, particularly through the implementation of a virtual being named PLEA, manifested in both worlds: the virtual and the physical one through a robotic head. It discusses the utility of such agents in various applications and employs ethnographic communication methodologies for data collection and analysis to unearth interaction patterns. Additionally, it examines human reactions to PLEA through a user-centered design approach, highlighting interactions based solely on facial expressions between PLEA and human participants. This investigation aims to lay the groundwork for developing multidisciplinary methods to collect, analyze, and abstract data from real-time interactions and feedback sessions, advancing the discourse on AI's integration into human social environments.

AB  - Polariscope is an R&D project resulting from a consortium between the academia and a municipal historical archive. The project is focused on developing a participatory digital experience of cultural archives and events from multiple perspectives using collaborative storytelling to share, visualize and co-create collective memories. Designed as an online community that gathers contributions from citizens and institutions, the platform intends to promote rich digital experiences through interactive and narrative visualizations around meaningful cultural events and heritage data, presenting multimedia visualizations built from archives and testimonies shared by people. The methodological approach of the project adopts a User-Centered Design (UCD) iterative process comprising four phases: 1) Literature review and related work; 2) User research and functional requirements specification; 3) Laboratory evaluation of a medium-fidelity prototype with users; 4) Pilot case studies in field trials related to cultural events. This paper is focused on presenting phases 1 and 2, which are dedicated to the definition and ideation of the digital experience proposed by the platform, validated by an empirical study using focus groups with experts. In overall, the results allowed the validation of the functional requirements, and the identification of the expected features and interaction patterns related to the processes of content contribution, validation, discovery, and curation to include in the next iteration of the prototype to be tested with users.

AB  - As artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly mediate high-stakes decisions in domains such as healthcare, finance, and education, ensuring transparency and ethical accountability in AI interfaces is critical. However, existing interfaces often obscure algorithmic processes, leading to overtrust, disengagement, or mis-interpretation of AI-generated outputs. My research explores how interface design-including presentation modes, interactive explainability tools, and speculative design interventions-can shape user perceptions, foster critical reflection, and enhance AI literacy. By integrating controlled experiments, participatory design, and qualitative analysis, my work aims to develop AI interfaces that not only communicate algorithmic decisions effectively but also encourage users to critically assess the ethical implications of AI technologies. I examine the trade-offs between transparency, usability, and engagement, investigating how interfaces can balance cognitive load while making ethical considerations more salient. Through this doctoral consortium, I seek mentorship and feedback on designing adaptive transparency mechanisms and mitigating overtrust in engaging AI interfaces.

AB  - Introduction: Self-management of chronic diseases using mobile health (mHealth) systems and applications is becoming common. Current evaluation methods such as formal usability testing can be very costly and timeconsuming; others may be more efficient but lack a user focus. We propose an enhanced cognitive walkthrough (CW) method, the user-centered CW (UC-CW), to address identified deficiencies in the original technique and perform a beginning validation with think aloud protocol (TA) to assess its effectiveness, efficiency and user acceptance in a case study with diabetes patient users on a mHealth self-management application.
   Materials and methods: A total of 12 diabetes patients at University of Utah Health, USA, were divided into UC-CW and think aloud (TA) groups. The UC-CW method included: making the user the main evaluator for detecting usability problems, having a dual domain facilitator, and using three other improved processes: validated task development, higher level tasks and a streamlined evaluation process. Users interacted with the same mHealth application for both methods. Post-evaluation assessments included the NASA RTLX instrument and a set of brief interview questions.
   Results: Participants had similar demographic characteristics. A total of 26 usability problems were identified with the UC-CW and 20 with TA. Both methods produced similar ratings: severity across all views (UC-CW = 2.7 and TA = 2.6), numbers of problems in the same views (Main View [UC-CW = 11, TA = 10], Carbohydrate Entry View [UC-CW = 4, TA = 3] and List View [UC-CW = 3, TA = 3]) with similar heuristic violations (Match Between the System and Real World [UC-CW = 19, TA = 16], Consistency and Standards [UC-CW = 17, TA = 15], and Recognition Rather than Recall [UC-CW = 13, TA = 10]). Both methods converged on eight usability problems, but the UC-CW group detected five critical issues while the TA group identified two. The UC-CW group identified needed personalized features for patients' disease needs not identified with TA. UC-CW was more efficient on average time per identified usability problem and on the total evaluation process with patients. NASA RTLX scores indicated that participants experienced the UC-CW half as cognitively demanding. Common themes from interviews indicated the UC-CW as enjoyable and easy to perform while TA was considered somewhat awkward and more cognitively challenging.
   Conclusions: UC-CW was effective for finding severe, recurring usability problems and it highlighted the need for personalized user features. The method was also efficient and had high user acceptance. These results indicate UC-CW's utility and user acceptance in evaluating a mHealth self-management application. It provides an additional usability evaluation technique for researchers.

AB  - Background: Most mHealth app users rely on an app's rankings, star ratings, or reviews, which may not reflect users' individual healthcare needs. To help healthcare providers, researchers, and users select an optimal mHealth app, the Method of App Selection based on User Needs (MASUN) 1.0(1) was developed and tested in prior research. Initial testing found the need for improvement.
   Objective: This multiple-phase study aimed to simplify and improve MASUN 1.0, resulting in MASUN 2.0, and verify the feasibility and usability of MASUN 2.0.
   Methods: This study was conducted in three phases: (1) modification of MASUN 1.0 to improve its importance, applicability, relevance, and clarity, in consultation with 21 experts in medical or nursing informatics; (2) validation of the draft MASUN 2.0, with 13 experts; and (3) feasibility testing of MASUN 2.0 and usability evaluation of the best app found through MASUN 2.0. Menstrual apps were used to test the framework.
   Results: From Phases 1 and 2, MASUN 2.0, the framework for mHealth App selection, was derived with improved simplicity, usability, and applicability through a reduced number of tasks and time required. In Phase 3, after screening and scoring 2377 menstrual apps, five candidate apps were selected and evaluated by five clinical experts, five app experts, and five potential users. Finally, 194 users evaluated the usability of the app selected as the best. The best app helped users understand their health-related syndromes and patterns. Additionally, userprovided scores for impact, usefulness, and ease of use for the app were higher than for others.
   Conclusions: This study successfully modified MASUN 1.0 into MASUN 2.0 and verified MASUN 2.0 through content validity, feasibility, and usability testing. The selected apps through MASUN 2.0 helped health consumers more easily address health discomfort. Future research should extend this work to an automated system and different medical conditions with multiple stakeholders for digital health equity.

AB  - Background: Guidelines recommend reluctant psychotropic drug (PD) prescribing in nursing home residents with dementia and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), as efficacy of PDs is limited, and side effects are common. Nevertheless, PDs are commonly prescribed to reduce NPS. A smartphone application that evaluates appropriateness of PD prescriptions and provides recommendations from the revised Dutch guideline on problem behaviour in dementia may promote guideline adherence and increase appropriate prescribing.Objective: This study aimed to assess user experiences, barriers and facilitators of the Dutch 'Psychotropic Drug Tool' smartphone application (PDT) in the context of appropriate prescribing of PDs to nursing home residents with dementia and NPS.Methods/design: The PDT was developed according to the recommendations of the Dutch guideline for treatment of NPS in people with dementia. Feedback provided during usability testing with two end-users was applied to improve the PDT before implementation in day-to-day practice. Sixty-three prescribers were asked to use the PDT at their own convenience for four months. User expectations and experiences were assessed at baseline and after four months with the System Usability Scale and the Assessment of Barriers and Facilitators for Implementation.Results: Expected usability (M = 72.59; SD = 11.84) was similar to experienced usability after four months (M = 69.13; SD = 16.48). Appreciation of the PDTs user-friendliness (on average 6.7 out of 10) and design (7.3) were moderately positive, in contrast to the global rating of the PDT (5.7). Perceived barriers for PDT use were time consumption and lack of integration with existing electronic systems. Perceived facilitators were ease of use and attractive lay out. For broader implementation, physicians suggested a change in direction of the PDT: start assessment of appropriateness based on the list of NPS instead of PD as primary input.Conclusions: In this pragmatic prospective cohort study we found that the PDT was used by elderly care physicians, with mediocre user satisfaction. The PDT will be optimized based on user feedback regarding experienced usability, barriers and facilitators, after which broader implementation can be initialized. The Medical Ethics Review Board of the University Medical Center Groningen declared this is a non-WMO study (UMCG RR Number: 201800284).

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an overwhelming strain on our Nations ability to treat patients; the number of patients who need to be tested continues to rise. With nurses also becoming infected, the number of trained professionals who can perform tasks such as testing of patients along with providing care involving hooking up patients to ventilators continues to decrease as well. There is a need to explore the adoption of virtual computer-based training mediums which will enable new nurses and others to be trained in safe and efficient procedures involving patients during this pandemic period. In this paper, the design of a VR-based simulator based on Human-Centered Computing (HCC) principles are discussed. The role of HCC factors such as affordance and cognitive load on the comprehension and scene understanding of nurses during training and the acquisition of knowledge of safety procedures and detailed steps (pertaining to nasal sample collection and use of ventilators on patients) has been studied with the involvement of nurse and nurse trainee participants. Adoption of a participatory design approach involving experts (nurses, doctors involved in covid-19 testing and treatment) has provided a foundational basis for the design of the training environments and assessment activities. Formal information-centric process models of the nasal swabbing procedures and ventilator hookup tasks were created using the engineering Enterprise Modeling Language (eEML). The preliminary results from the assessment activities indicate the positive impact of such HCC based 3D simulators in such training of first responders.
