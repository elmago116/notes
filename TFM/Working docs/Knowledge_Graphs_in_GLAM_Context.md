**Keywords:** Scientific Writing, Knowledge Graphs, Fair Data, Gpt, Revolution

**Abstract:** Scientific papers have evolved since the establishment of the Royal Society in the mid-17(th) century. Today, despite the interconnectedness of Internet discourse, scientific papers are released as relatively static, inflexible artifacts, to wit, as Portable Document Format ( PDF) files. This fact is an egregious slight to the base principle of science: that it is to be mutable and evolutionary. Thus, the present paper proposes a means of writing scientific papers that allows for change and expl...

ID analysts protect their networks by searching for evidence of attacks in ID system output, Trewall and system logs, and other complex, textual data sources. Monitoring and analyzing these sources incurs a heavy cognitive load for analysts. The use of inf...

**Authors:** Ruthford, M.A.

**Year:** 2002

**Source:** IPCC 2002, REFLECTIONS ON COMMUNICATION, PROCEEDINGS

**Type:** CPAPER

**DOI:** 10.1109/ipcc.2002.1049116

**Keywords:** Usability Methods, Conceptual Model, User Interface Design, User Interaction Design

**Abstract:** Over the past two years the Usability Engineers at Attachmate Corporation have taken on new roles and responsibilities and have become involved earlier in the software development process. The opportunity to participate in the up-front design work, in addition to the more traditional usability evaluations, has been the driving force to mix and match pieces from existing usability methods. Many usability methods have been developed, and each method includes many techniques that can be used indepe...

## PD-657. Evaluation of user interface designs for information retrieval systems: a computer-based experiment

**Authors:** Hu, P.J.H., Ma, P.C., Chau, P.Y.K.

**Year:** 1999

**Source:** DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS

**Type:** JOUR

**DOI:** 10.1016/S0167-9236(99)00040-8

**Keywords:** User Interface Design and Evaluation, Human-computer Interaction, Information Retrieval, System-user Concept Communication, Graphics, Color, Performance, Constraints

**Abstract:** In this study, we conducted a computer-based experiment to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of six different interface designs, graphical or list-based, in supporting communication of an object's "relevance" from an information retrieval (IR) system to its users. We adopted the Model Human Processor to provide a necessary framework to incorporate relevant cognitive psychology theories and user-centered design principles in the development of different interfaces. The study had a well-resea...
