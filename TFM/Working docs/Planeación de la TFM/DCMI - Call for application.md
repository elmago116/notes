description: "DCMI 2025, the twenty-third International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications, invites researchers, practitioners, and experts from diverse domains to explore the dynamic landscape of metadata in the theme of (Meta)data at the Core: Bridging Human Knowledge and AI Innovation. The fast-paced advances in artificial intelligence (AI) create new research opportunities for metadata. While AI has the potential to enhance metadata quality through systematic tasks like error detection and data standardisation, metadata researchers and practitioners highlight the crucial role of human oversight of AI-generated metadata to ensure accuracy, contextual understanding, and ethical considerations."
