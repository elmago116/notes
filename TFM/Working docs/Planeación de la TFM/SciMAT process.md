> > Science mapping or bibliometric mapping is a spatial representation of how disciplines, fields, specialities, and individual papers or authors are related to one another (Small, 1999). It is focused on monitoring a scientific field and delimiting research areas to determine its cognitive structure and its evolution (Noyons, Moed, & van Raan, 1999).

> > The simple centers algorithm is a simple and well-known algorithm in the context of co-word analysis, that has been used in many co-word studies (Bailón-Moreno et al., 2005, 2006; Coulter et al., 1998; Courtial, 1990; Courtial & Michelet, 1994; López-Herrera et al., 2009, 2010; He, 1999). Furthermore, the simple centers algorithm automatically returns labelled clusters, so a post-process to label the clusters is not needed.

> >  the simple centers algorithm uses two passes through the data to produce the desired networks. The first pass (Pass-1) constructs the networks depicting the strongest associations, and links added in this pass are called internal links. The second pass (Pass-2) adds to these networks links of weaker strengths that form associations between networks. The links added during the second pass are called external links.
