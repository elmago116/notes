# Extract Conversation into memories/ using Basic Memory MCP

## Goal
Extract important information from a referenced conversation into the following folders using the available tools:

### Folders
- `plans` - action plans, roadmaps, to-do lists
- `knowledge` - stable reference facts, policies, domain docs
- `decisions` - architecture / product choices & rationale
- `lessons_learned` - retrospectives, what-went-well, mistakes to avoid

### Tasks
1.  **Scan the `conversation_log`** for the following:
    -   `#Plans` - any clearly stated tasks, next steps, or roadmaps
    -   `#Knowledge` - stable facts, policies, formulas, specs
    -   `#Decisions` - explicit choices made and their justification
    -   `#Lessons Learned` - mistakes, insights, or heuristics expressed

2.  **For each extracted item:**
    -   Choose a clear, concise `title`.
    -   Run `write_note` with the `folder` set to the target directory.

3.  **Link and relate:**
    -   Use wiki links (`[[Other Note]]`) to connect to existing notes when relevant.

4.  **Verify and report:**
    -   After all writes/edits, call `sync_status()` to confirm memory health.
    -   Provide a summary list of the notes you created or updated.
