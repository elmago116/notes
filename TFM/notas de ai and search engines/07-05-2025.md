- ## which is the best bibliometric research methodology to describe the conceptual structure of a field and its methodologies based on autor keywords and indexed keywords
	To describe the conceptual structure of a research field and its methodologies using author keywords and indexed keywords, bibliometric methods that combine keyword co-occurrence analysis, network analysis, and advanced semantic or machine learning techniques are most effective. **Keyword co-occurrence network analysis, especially when enhanced with semantic or machine learning approaches, provides the most comprehensive and nuanced mapping of a field’s conceptual and methodological landscape.**
	## Keyword Co-occurrence and Network Analysis
	- **Keyword co-occurrence analysis** is widely used to map the intellectual and conceptual structure of a field by identifying clusters of related topics and themes based on how often keywords appear together in publications.
	- Network analysis of these co-occurrences reveals the relationships between concepts, the evolution of research themes, and the emergence of new topics. Topological coefficients and clustering can further characterize the structure and development of the field.
	## Integration of Author and Indexed Keywords
	- Both **Author Keywords** and **Keywords Plus** (indexed keywords) are valuable for bibliometric mapping. Author Keywords tend to be more specific to the article’s content, while Keywords Plus are broader and can capture wider conceptual connections. Using both provides a more complete picture of the field’s structure.
	- Comparative studies show that Keywords Plus is as effective as Author Keywords for field-level analysis, though less comprehensive at the article level. Combining both enhances the robustness of conceptual mapping.
	## Advanced and Hybrid Approaches
	- **Semantic analysis and machine learning** (e.g., Word2Vec, Latent Dirichlet Allocation) can be integrated with traditional keyword analysis to capture deeper conceptual relationships and latent themes, moving beyond simple frequency counts to semantic similarity and topic modeling.
	- Nested or hierarchical approaches, where broad co-occurrence networks are refined into sub-networks, allow for detailed exploration of main themes and sub-themes within a field.
	## Conclusion
	For mapping the conceptual structure and methodologies of a research field using keywords, the best approach combines keyword co-occurrence network analysis with both author and indexed keywords, and is further enhanced by semantic or machine learning techniques. This integrated methodology offers the most detailed and accurate representation of a field’s intellectual landscape.

	Keyword co-occurrence analysis is a widely used bibliometric method for revealing the **conceptual structure** of research fields. By examining how keywords appear together across publications, this approach helps identify major themes, research hotspots, and emerging trends within a discipline.
	## Effectiveness in Revealing Conceptual Structures
	- **Mapping Research Hotspots and Trends:** Keyword co-occurrence analysis effectively highlights central topics and evolving research directions. For example, in studies of non-coding RNAs in prostate cancer, co-occurrence clusters identified key research areas and emerging frontiers, such as “circRNA” and “exosome”.
	- **Identifying Thematic Clusters:** This method groups related keywords into clusters, which represent the main conceptual areas and subfields. In meningioma research, keyword analysis revealed both longstanding and newly emerging topics, such as diagnostic methods and machine learning applications.
	- **Tracking Thematic Evolution:** By analyzing changes in keyword co-occurrence over time, bibliometric studies can track how research themes develop and shift, providing insights into the field’s conceptual evolution.
	## Visualization and Interpretation
	- **Network Visualization:** Tools like VOSviewer and CiteSpace are commonly used to visualize keyword co-occurrence networks, making it easier to interpret the relationships between concepts and to spot central or peripheral themes.
	- **Guiding Future Research:** The identification of research hotspots and conceptual clusters provides valuable guidance for scholars seeking to understand the structure of a field or to identify gaps and opportunities for future work.
	## Conclusion
	Keyword co-occurrence analysis is an effective and established method for uncovering the conceptual structure of research fields in bibliometrics. It enables the identification of major themes, tracks the evolution of research topics, and supports strategic decision-making for researchers and institutions.

	## Effectiveness of Keyword Co-occurrence in Revealing Conceptual Structures in Humanities and Social Sciences
	### Revealing Conceptual and Intellectual Structures
	Keyword co-occurrence analysis is effective in mapping the conceptual and intellectual structure of research fields within the humanities and social sciences. Studies have shown that this method can identify major research clusters, thematic areas, and the evolution of topics over time. For example, in the field of library and information science, keyword co-occurrence and social network analysis revealed research hotspots and core themes such as “service,” “technology,” and “digital library”. Similarly, in educational research on critical race theory, keyword co-occurrence analysis identified four distinct clusters that characterize the intellectual structure of the field.
	### Mapping Research Trends and Thematic Evolution
	Keyword co-occurrence networks help trace the development and changing trajectory of research areas. In metadiscourse studies, keyword-based co-occurrence networks were used to sketch major research areas and detect their evolution, providing valuable orientation for new researchers and highlighting emerging issues. In studies of complexity science across multiple disciplines, co-occurrence analysis revealed a shift from foundational to more applied and specific research themes, demonstrating the method’s ability to capture thematic evolution.
	### Supporting Systematic Reviews and Knowledge Mapping
	Keyword co-occurrence networks (KCNs) are increasingly used to guide and accelerate systematic reviews in the social sciences and humanities. KCNs can quickly map the knowledge structure of a domain, uncover meaningful knowledge components, and identify research trends, often matching the insights gained from traditional systematic reviews but with greater efficiency. This approach is considered universal and applicable across various fields, including those in the humanities and social sciences.
	### Enhancing Conceptual Analysis with Advanced Methods
	Recent methodological advances, such as integrating semantic similarity measures and network analysis, have improved the quality and interpretability of keyword co-occurrence results. These enhancements lead to more meaningful content and clearer exposition of emergent themes, further supporting the method’s effectiveness in conceptual mapping.
	## Conclusion
	Keyword co-occurrence analysis is a robust and effective method for revealing the conceptual structure, thematic clusters, and research trends in the humanities and social sciences. It provides valuable insights for both mapping existing knowledge and guiding future research directions.
