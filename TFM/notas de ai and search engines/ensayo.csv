"Cultural Heritage Information Retrieval: Past, Present, and Future Trends","Semantic Web technologies have revolutionized cultural heritage information retrieval, leading to intelligent applications and services.","Babak Ranjgar, A. Sadeghi-Niaraki, Maryam Shakeri, Fatema Rahimi, Soo-Mi Choi",2024,2,"The importance of knowledge organization and information retrieval techniques has been evident throughout human history, becoming even more crucial in the digital age. While computer systems and the web have facilitated information retrieval, challenges arose with the increasing volume of data. The introduction of Semantic Web technologies aimed to enhance precision and accuracy by converting the web into a structured data format. The Cultural Heritage (CH) community has been at the forefront of adopting Semantic Web practices to promote interoperability and shared understanding. In this study, we present a comprehensive conceptual framework that spans cultural heritage, information modeling, and information retrieval. Our model addresses early solutions in knowledge organization systems, highlighting the evolution from classification systems and controlled vocabularies to the significance of metadata schemas. We delve into the limitations of traditional knowledge organization systems and the necessity of formal ontologies, particularly in the cultural heritage domain. The comparative analysis of CRM vs. EDM, ontology-based metadata interoperability, and ontology technologies elucidate our contributions to the field. This paper outlines the process from the initial steps of adopting Semantic Web technologies in the CH domain to the latest developments in CH information retrieval. In this paper, we also reviewed intelligent applications and services developed in the CH domain after establishing semantic data models and Knowledge Organization Systems. Finally, challenges and possible future research directions are discussed. The findings revealed that GLAMs (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) are excellent and comprehensive sources of CH information. The CH community has put in a lot of time and effort to develop data models and knowledge organization tools; now it’s time to use this valuable resource to construct smart applications that are still in their early phases. This could benefit the CH industry even more.","","IEEE Access","1","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3374769","https://consensus.app/papers/cultural-heritage-information-retrieval-past-present-and-ranjgar-sadeghi-niaraki/2043ce71f60358ff8563da7ca3abb53f/"
"Knowledge Graphs for Cultural Heritage and Digital Humanities","Knowledge graphs can enhance cultural heritage and digital humanities research by connecting diverse data and perspectives, but face challenges in modeling, enriching, linking, and making them usable for various user tasks.","Victor de Boer",2023,1,"Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (so-called GLAMs) as well as digital humanities researchers are more and more publishing and sharing digital data, information and knowledge online. This opens new opportunities for cross-institute, cross-researcher and cross-project collaborations and analyses of such (multi-modal) data. Semantic Web principles and technologies and more specifically Knowledge Graphs are excellent models for representing and integrating heterogeneous data while allowing for standardized access and querying. However, several challenges remain in the modelling, enriching and linking such cultural knowledge graphs, as well as making them usable for a variety of real-world user tasks. In this talk, I discuss the promises and challenges of designing, constructing and enriching knowledge graphs for cultural heritage and digital humanities. I will talk about semantic interoperability and how connecting previously unconnected data and knowledge presents new opportunities for historians, media scholars and other researchers. User-centric challenges include how such integrated and multimodal data can be browsed, queried or analysed using for state of the art machine learning. I will also address the issue of polyvocality, where multiple perspectives on (historical) information is to be represented. Especially in contexts such as that of (post-)colonial heritage, representing multiple voices is crucial. I will show ongoing research on how knowledge graphs can provide excellent vehicles for this.","","Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on analySis, Understanding and proMotion of heritAge Contents","","10.1145/3607542.3617354","https://consensus.app/papers/knowledge-graphs-for-cultural-heritage-and-digital-boer/0a710aa7ed7a553c9077f1d07e326d59/"
"Towards a semantic approach in GLAM Labs: the case of the Data Foundry at the National Library of Scotland","This paper presents a framework for transforming datasets made available by GLAM organizations under open licenses into Linked Data, which can be applied to other domains like digital humanities and data science.","Gustavo Candela",2023,7,"GLAM organisations have been exploring the benefits of publishing their digital collections in a wide variety of forms since the 2000s. Many institutions, and in particular libraries, have applied the Semantic Web and Linked Data to their main catalogues. Recent advances in technology and innovative approaches concerning the reuse of the digital collections by means of computational access have paved the way for the creation of laboratories within GLAM organisations. In this work, we present a framework that works in several steps to transform into linked open data (LOD), assess and enrich with external repositories the data sets made available by GLAM organisations under open licences. The framework has been applied to three metadata data sets made available by the Data Foundry at the National Library of Scotland obtaining as a result a collection of LOD repositories, a data quality assessment and examples of exploration. The results of this work are publicly available and can be applied to other domains such as digital humanities and data science.","","ArXiv","1","10.1177/01655515231174386","https://consensus.app/papers/towards-a-semantic-approach-in-glam-labs-the-case-of-the-data-candela/c652556198f5509aa0b670d777b82649/"

"A Blockchain-Based Semantic Exchange Framework for Web 3.0 Toward Participatory Economy","This blockchain-based semantic exchange framework enables fair and efficient interactions in Web 3.0 by tokenizing semantic information, using a Stackelberg game, and leveraging Zero-Knowledge Proof for privacy-preserving trading.","Yi-Lan Lin, Zhipeng Gao, Yaofeng Tu, Hongyang Du, D. Niyato, Jiawen Kang, Hui Yang",2022,18,"Web 3.0 is the next-generation Internet that enables participants to read, write, and own contents in a decentralized manner. It is mainly driven by blockchain, semantic communication, edge computing, and artificial intelligence, which can construct value networks to achieve participatory economics based on participatory decision making. Web 3.0 can capture the characteristics of blockchain, semantic extraction, and communication to achieve decentralized semantic sharing and transfer information precisely. However, current Web 3.0 solutions focus on the blockchain while overlooking other new technologies' roles in Web 3.0. To further unleash the advantages of semantic extraction and communication in Web 3.0, in this article, we propose a blockchain-based semantic exchange framework to realize fair and efficient interactions. In this framework, we first attempt to tokenize semantic information into Non-Fungible Token (NFT) for semantic exchange. Then we utilize a Stackelberg game to maximize buying and pricing strategies for semantic trading. We also leverage Zero-Knowledge Proof to share authentic semantic information without publishing it before receiving payments, which can achieve a fair and privacy-preserving trading compared with current NFT marketplaces. A case study about urban planning is given to show clearly the proposed mechanisms. Finally, several challenges and opportunities are identified.","","IEEE Communications Magazine","1","10.1109/MCOM.003.2200817","https://consensus.app/papers/a-blockchainbased-semantic-exchange-framework-for-web-30-lin-gao/87ade7d161e0530597ce397057d0a22f/"
"Digital humanities on the Semantic Web: Sampo model and portal series","The Sampo model successfully creates shared data services and semantic portals for digital humanities research, enabling global access to cultural heritage content for analysis and application development.","E. Hyvönen",2022,62,"Cultural heritage (CH) contents are typically strongly interlinked, but published in heterogeneous, distributed local data silos, making it difficult to utilize the data on a global level. Furthermore, the content is usually available only for humans to read, and not as data for Digital Humanities (DH) analyses and application development. This application report addresses these problems by presenting a collaborative publication model for CH Linked Data and six design principles for creating shared data services and semantic portals for DH research and applications. This Sampo model has evolved gradually in 2002–2021 through lessons learned when developing the Sampo series of linked data services and semantic portals in use, including MuseumFinland (2004), CultureSampo (2009), BookSampo (2011), WarSampo (2015), Norssit Alumni (2017), U.S. Congress Prosopographer (2018), NameSampo (2019), BiographySampo (2019), WarVictimSampo 1914–1922 (2019), MMM (2020), AcademySampo (2021), FindSampo (2021), WarMemoirSampo (2021), and LetterSampo (2022). These Semantic Web applications surveyed in this paper cover a wide range of application domains in CH and have attracted up to millions of users on the Semantic Web, suggesting feasibility of the proposed Sampo model. This work shows a shift of focus in research on CH semantic portals from data aggregation and exploration systems (1. generation systems) to systems supporting DH research (2. generation systems) with data analytic tools, and finally to automatic knowledge discovery and Artificial Intelligence (3. generation systems).","","Semantic Web","2","10.3233/sw-223034","https://consensus.app/papers/digital-humanities-on-the-semantic-web-sampo-model-and-hyv%C3%B6nen/80ef5f8fc0e353d597347887115636a9/"

"Developing digital audience frameworks for Oxford’s GLAM","The new digital audience framework developed by GLAM in Oxford has informed strategic planning and evaluation, focusing on motivations rather than demographics, and has significantly influenced the Bodleian Libraries' website redevelopment.","E. McCarthy",2019,0,"
Purpose
In order to develop a common framework for strategic planning and evaluation, the Gardens, Libraries and Museums (GLAM) of Oxford undertook a process for defining digital audiences, undertaking user research to inform a new audience framework, which, in turn, is feeding a new approach and the application of the research across the Libraries’ web redevelopment. The paper aims to discuss this issue.


Design/methodology/approach
GLAM used qualitative and quantitative techniques to understand how visitors engaged with GLAM digitally: visitor shadowing, exit interviews, diary studies, remote interviews, social media and data evaluation. From these, GLAM focussed on motivational archetypes that apply to visitors across the institutions as well as pen portraits to support those archetypes, and a template for creating new portraits.


Findings
The framework helped GLAM develop digital priorities and outline how digital output met the needs of all audiences from a bottom-up user perspective, rather than only through top-down institutional decision making. Most relevant here, learning from the user research hugely informed the Bodleian Libraries’ website redevelopment. The Bodleian Libraries’ work within that framework shows that such a body of research is not solely high level; it can be applied on an institutional and project level to great effect.


Originality/value
Focussing on motivations rather than demographics is a less common way to approach digital audiences. Developing such a cohesive framework for digital audiences before undertaking strategic planning and specific development projects proved a valuable piece of work from which other institutions can learn.

"Crafting Digital Experiences: Embedding Human-Centred and Participatory Design into Archaeological Practice","Embedding Human-Centred and Participatory Design into archaeological practice can create more critically engaged digital encounters with the past, benefiting both the archaeological and heritage sectors.","Francesca Dolcetti",2024,0,"As digital archaeology has grown as a field of practice, so has the number of digital resources developed for specialists and non-specialists alike. However, the creation of such outputs has not always been accompanied and informed by design theory and practices. Design – used in its broadest definition as a process of conceptual making - is an integral, if often implicit, part of archaeological practices and it is through design that we develop and share our work – from data collection and analysis to interpretation and dissemination – and engage with our stakeholders. Engaging with core design practices offers meaningful opportunities for generating new forms of archaeological knowledge production and sharing, as well as creating digitally mediated experiences that are not guided by our own assumptions about our stakeholders’ needs and can really affect people’s engagement with the past. In this paper, I investigate the benefits of embedding Human-Centred and Participatory Design into the archaeology and heritage sectors to create more critically engaged digital encounters with the past.","","Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage","1","10.1145/3700880","https://consensus.app/papers/crafting-digital-experiences-embedding-humancentred-and-dolcetti/65620847b3895d89ba7692662ce71680/"
