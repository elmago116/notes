Quick search gives you fast, reliable answers. Pro Search gives you *more*.

## Pro Search: The best way to get a fast answer while taking into account dozens of sources

Pro Search is an advanced feature that goes beyond our free Auto search option. It conducts thorough research to provide in-depth, accurate responses to your questions.

Auto mode gives you fast, reliable answers. Pro Search gives you more.

## Smarter interactions

Pro Search uses advanced AI models including Sonar, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Claude 3.7, and Gemini Flash 2.0 to engage in meaningful dialogue. Going much further than traditional search engines, it actively shows you, step-by-step, how it breaks down your question and performs deep research. It links to every source it references, giving you answers you can trust.

Expect precise, relevant responses every time.

## Benefits of Pro Search

**It solves complex problems**

Pro Search asks clarifying questions to hone in on what you're really looking for, eliminating irrelevant information.

**It summarizes from many sources**

Its responses compile the best insights from a wide range of sources and links directly to them, so you don't have to sift through endless pages to find the information you need.

**It interprets code**

Pro Search includes a code interpreter that allows users to execute code and obtain fast results. This feature is particularly useful for data analysis, debugging, and content generation, making it the perfect tool for developers and data scientists.
