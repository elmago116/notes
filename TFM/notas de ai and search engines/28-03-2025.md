# i want to know if there is an academic paper (on google scholar, archivescholar, Scopus, web of science and such) about the use of knowledge graphs and semantic frames on historical corpus role: academic researcher

While I couldn't find a specific academic paper directly linking "knowledge graphs" and "semantic frames" on historical corpora through the provided search results, there are related concepts and studies that might be relevant:

1. **Knowledge Graphs in Historical Contexts**: Knowledge graphs are widely used in various domains, including historical research, to represent and analyze complex relationships between entities. For instance, they can be applied to historical texts to extract entities and their relationships, which might indirectly involve semantic frames by analyzing the context and meaning of historical events or texts[^5][^4].
2. **Semantic Frames**: #Tech/KG/semantic_frames  Semantic frames are a concept from linguistics that involve identifying and categorizing the roles played by entities in a sentence or text. While not directly linked to knowledge graphs in historical corpora, semantic frames can be used to enhance the semantic analysis of historical texts, potentially integrating with knowledge graphs to provide deeper insights into historical contexts[^3].
3. **Historical Corpus Analysis**: There are studies on analyzing historical corpora using various semantic and computational methods. For example, scholarly knowledge graphs have been used to structure and analyze scholarly communication, which could be adapted to historical texts[^4].

To find specific papers on this topic, you might need to search academic databases like Google Scholar, Scopus, or Web of Science using keywords like "knowledge graphs," "semantic frames," and "historical corpus analysis." You could also explore related fields such as digital humanities or historical information retrieval.

Here's a suggested search query for academic databases:

```
("knowledge graphs" OR "semantic networks") AND ("semantic frames" OR "frame semantics") AND ("historical corpus" OR "historical texts")
```

This query might help you find relevant studies or papers that explore the intersection of these concepts in historical contexts.
