# Optimal Keywords for Human-Centered Metadata and Interaction in GLAM: A Scoping Review Framework

This report provides a comprehensive collection of strategic keywords for conducting a scoping review on Human-Centered Metadata and Interaction in the GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) sector, with a focus on user experience and adaptive metadata systems. The keywords are organized into conceptual categories to facilitate a structured and thorough literature search.

## Core Conceptual Keywords

The foundation of your scoping review should include terminology that directly addresses the intersection of human-centered approaches and metadata systems within the GLAM context.

### Human-Centered Metadata Terminology

Human-centered metadata approaches emphasize placing users at the center of metadata design and implementation. Key terms in this domain include:

#bibliometrics/KW
* Human-centered metadata
* Person-centered metadata
* User-centered metadata design
* Participatory metadata creation
* Collaborative metadata systems
* Implicit human-centered tagging
* Human-AI collaboration for metadata

The concept of person-centered metadata has been applied in practical contexts such as The Behaviours in Dementia Toolkit, where personhood was prioritized in metadata schema development[^1_9]. Implicit human-centered tagging represents an "effortless process by which content is tagged based on users' spontaneous reactions," showing how user behavior can inform metadata creation[^1_10].

### GLAM-Specific Metadata Concepts

Within the GLAM sector, several specialized metadata concepts have emerged:



GLAM 

* GLAM metadata interoperability
* Cultural heritage metadata 
* GLAM metadata standards
* Metadata crosswalks for GLAM
* Digital collections metadata
* Semantic approach in GLAM #bibliometrics/KW
* GLAM metadata quality assessment #bibliometrics/KW

GLAM metadata interoperability presents ongoing challenges that require understanding and overcoming disciplinary differences[^1_12]. Research has shown varying emphases on metadata functions across different types of GLAM institutions, with inconsistent application practices highlighting the need for human-centered approaches[^1_16].

## UX and Interactive Metadata Systems

User experience considerations are increasingly central to metadata system design, particularly as these systems become more interactive.

### User Experience in Metadata

#bibliometrics/KW
* Metadata usability
* Metadata discovery interfaces
* User-centered metadata schema
* Metadata interaction patterns
* Cognitive aspects of metadata use
* Accessible metadata systems
* User testing for metadata systems

Scholastic, for example, demonstrates how "human-centered algorithm design and visualizations employing familiar metaphors can support inductive and interpretive research methodologies through interactive topic modeling and document clustering"[^1_13]. This exemplifies how UX principles can enhance metadata-driven research.

### Adaptive and Intelligent Metadata Systems

* Adaptive metadata models
* Self-refining metadata systems
* Learning metadata frameworks
* Intelligent metadata generation
* Context-aware metadata
* Dynamic metadata adaptation
* User-responsive metadata systems #bibliometrics/KW 

Current research shows the potential of systems that "automatically produce increasingly refined metadata by learning from the structural metadata contributed by scholars"[^1_6]. This demonstrates how adaptive systems can evolve based on user input and behavior.

## Technical and Methodological Approaches

To ensure comprehensive coverage, your scoping review should include technical implementation and research methodology terms.

### Technical Implementation Keywords

* Linked Open Data (LOD) in GLAM #bibliometrics/KW
* FAIR data principles for metadata
* RDF Mapping Language (RML) #bibliometrics/KW
* Knowledge graphs for metadata #bibliometrics/KW
* Generative AI for metadata enhancement
* Natural Language Processing in metadata
* Metadata annotation tools

Recent advances include frameworks transforming GLAM data into linked open data (LOD), assessing quality, and enriching with external repositories[^1_14]. The EUFCC-340K dataset provides a novel resource for metadata annotation in GLAM collections, organized across multiple facets in a hierarchical structure[^1_8].

### Research Methodology Keywords

* Scoping review methodologies
* User-centered design for metadata #bibliometrics/KW
* Participatory metadata design #bibliometrics/KW
	* participatory RDF design #bibliometrics/KW
* Card sorting for metadata organization
* Think-aloud protocols for metadata interaction
* Co-design of metadata systems #bibliometrics/KW
* Metadata workflow analysis

Methodologies like card sorting activities, usability studies, and interdisciplinary collaboration have been employed in developing person-centered metadata approaches[^1_9]. These human-centered research methods ensure metadata systems effectively serve user needs.

## Emerging and Specialized Areas

Your scoping review should incorporate cutting-edge concepts that represent the future direction of human-centered metadata in GLAM.

### Emerging Technologies and Approaches

* Artificial Intelligence in metadata creation
* Large Language Models for metadata
* MetaQA (Metadata Question Answering)
* Human-AI collaborative metadata
* Generative Pre-trained Transformer for metadata
* Federated learning for metadata sharing
* Multimodal metadata approaches

MetaQA, for instance, integrates "end-to-end AI models with a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) to enhance geosearch services," demonstrating how advanced AI can improve metadata accessibility[^1_3]. The integration of DICOM guidelines for image metadata standardization shows how domain-specific approaches can enhance metadata usability[^1_1].

### Specialized Application Domains

* Audio metadata repositories
* Image metadata in cultural collections
* Scholar metadata systems
* Domain-specific metadata approaches
* Faceted hierarchical metadata
* Structural metadata for knowledge generation
* Metadata for digital twins

HomeBank represents a specialized application as "a public, permanent, extensible, online database of daylong audio recorded in naturalistic environments" with associated metadata files including "participant demographics and clinical diagnostics, automated annotations, and human-generated transcriptions"[^1_17]. This exemplifies how human-centered metadata can serve specialized research communities.

## Conclusion

An effective scoping review on Human-Centered Metadata and Interaction in the GLAM sector requires a strategic keyword approach that spans conceptual, technical, and methodological domains. The keywords presented in this report provide a comprehensive framework for literature searching that captures both established practices and emerging innovations.

By utilizing these keywords in various combinations, your scoping review can effectively map the current landscape of human-centered metadata approaches in GLAM, identify research gaps, and highlight promising directions for enhancing user experience in metadata systems. The integration of user-centered design principles with metadata practices represents a significant opportunity to improve discoverability, accessibility, and usability of cultural heritage resources.
