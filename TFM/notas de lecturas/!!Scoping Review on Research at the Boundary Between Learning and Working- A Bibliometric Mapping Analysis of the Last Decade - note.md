> Using tools for bibliometric analysis, we mapped the research field at the boundary between learning and working in a scoping review study. The #research_method/ScopingReview  scoping review provides the methodological framework, ranging from database selection, article collection, analysis (here: using bibliometric analysis), interpretation, and conclusion. Another name for this type of research, which is a combination of scoping review and #bibliometrics bibliometric analysis, is #research_method  science mapping: The aim of science mapping is to build #bibliometrics/indicator  bibliometric network and/or cluster maps which help to describe how a particular field of research is intellectually and conceptually structured (Cobo et al., 2011a.) #op/buscar_rm  #op/done

> How is the research field intellectually structured? To determine the intellectual structure, we analyse latent networks of countries, journals, and authors. Our second research question is: How is the research field conceptually structured? To determine the conceptual structure, we analyse the density and centrality of clustered references and keywords

### Bibliographic coupling - Co-citation analysis - Co-occurrence Relations

#### Coupling: 
> [[!!Scoping Review on Research at the Boundary Between Learning and Working- A Bibliometric Mapping Analysis of the Last Decade.pdf#page=8&annotation=912R|p.177]] >  "about the overlap in the reference lists of publications. The larger the number of references two publications have in common, the stronger the bibliographic coupling relation between the publications" (van Eck & Waltman, 2014, p. 287)

#### Co-citation
[[!!Scoping Review on Research at the Boundary Between Learning and Working- A Bibliometric Mapping Analysis of the Last Decade.pdf#page=8&selection=44,0,48,56|p.177]]
> Co-citation "is defined as the frequency with which two documents are cited together" (Small, 1973, p. 265).
