[[Bibliometrics_ The Leiden Manifesto for research metrics]]

1. Quantitative evaluation should support qualitative, expert assessment.
2. Measure performance against the research missions of the institution, group or researcher
3. Protect excellence in locally relevant research
4. Keep data collection and analytical processes open, transparent and simple.
5. Allow those evaluated to verify data and analysis.
6. Account for variation by field in publication and citation practices.
7. Base assessment of individual researchers on a qualitative judgement of their portfolio.
8. Avoid misplaced concreteness and false precision:

> The meaning of citation counts, for example, has long been debated. Thus, best practice uses multiple indicators to provide a more robust and pluralistic picture.

> Three decimal places on journal impact factor

9. Recognize the systemic effects of assessment and indicators
10. Scrutinize indicators regularly and update them.
