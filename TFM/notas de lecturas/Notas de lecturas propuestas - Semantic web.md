> rame-based Terminology (FBT) (Faber 2012, 2016, 2022) is a cognitive text-based theory that creates specialized frames, based on the data extracted from corpora. This includes the automatic extraction of predicate-argument structure.

>  they provide a rich and structured framework to organize concepts in a specialized domain

.6 Semantic computing Semantic computing #Tech/KG/semanticData  addresses the matching of computational content semantics to human intentions. It provides representations for describing information and uses these representations for retrieving, managing, manipulating and creating content (such as text, video, audio, process, function, device and network). Semantic description of content enables uncertainty reduction in cognitive processes and logical reasoning on information. This in turn helps to achieve information enrichment, deconfliction, summarization and comparison. Therefore, semantic computing is an approach that combines prior information and learning.
