What tacit knowledge can be represented and discovered through a knowledge graph, and what can be only indicated?

The final stage of this project will involve the same population in the participatory

design of visualizations and seamless visual analytical approach of the multiplex graph,

to examine if this artifact has utility compared to current means of information discovery,

and if it is worthwhile to develop it further into an information system.
