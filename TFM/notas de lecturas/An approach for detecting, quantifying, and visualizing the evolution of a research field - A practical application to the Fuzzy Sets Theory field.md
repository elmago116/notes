> > Science mapping or bibliometric mapping is a spatial representation of how disciplines, fields, specialities, and individual papers or authors are related to one another (Small, 1999). It is focused on monitoring a scientific field and delimiting research areas to determine its cognitive structure and its evolution (Noyons, Moed, & van Raan, 1999).

> > Different similarity measures have been used in the literature, the most popular being Saltonâ€™s Cosine and the Jaccard index. In van Eck and Waltman (2009) an analysis of well-known direct similarity measures was made, concluding that the most appropriate measure for normalizing co-occurrence frequencies is the equivalence index (Callon et al., 1991; Michelet, 1988). This measure is also known as association strength (Coulter et al., 1998; van Eck & Waltman, 2007), proximity index (Peters & van Raan, 1993; Rip & Courtial, 1984), or probabilistic affinity index (Zitt, Bassecoulard, & Okubo, 2000). The equivalence index, eij is defined as: eij = c2 ij /ci cj, where cij is the number of documents in which two keywords i and j co-occur and ci and cj represent the number of documents in which each one appears. When the keywords always appear together, the equivalence index equals unity; when they are never associated, it equals zero.
