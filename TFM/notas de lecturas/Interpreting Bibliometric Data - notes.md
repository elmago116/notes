[[Interpreting Bibliometric Data]]

<mark class="hltr-yellow">the citation metric </mark>is only an indicator of impact. <mark class="hltr-yellow">Citation counts</mark> reflect impact indirectly through a general population relationship and, for individual papers, may be awry in their information. Indeed, the mantra ‘on average’ has wide applicability to every aspect of this kind of analysis. Second, <mark class="hltr-yellow">citation counts rise over time</mark>, older papers have more citations ‘on average’ than more recent and an adjustment must be made to take account of the years since publication. Third, <mark class="hltr-yellow">citations accumulate at rates that are field dependent</mark>. For example, life sciences are more prolific and exhibit higher rates of citation on average than technological and social sciences and an adjustment must be made to take account of the field of publication ( [Moed et al., 1985a](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/research-metrics-and-analytics/articles/10.3389/frma.2020.628703/#B61) ). Fourth, <mark class="hltr-yellow">document type affects citation rates</mark> with reviews in journals cited more often than articles (‘on average’, see [Ketcham and Crawford, 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/research-metrics-and-analytics/articles/10.3389/frma.2020.628703/#B49); [Miranda and Garcia-Carpintero, 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/research-metrics-and-analytics/articles/10.3389/frma.2020.628703/#B60) ) while conference proceedings are cited less often than journal papers.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">There is a need for changes in the approach to using bibliometric data: the subject-expert user needs to be clear whether the data they have are relevant to the evaluation questions they pose; they need to establish an *a priori* understanding of how they will use the data and of the choices of methods to apply; and it should be standard practice that data are developed and presented not as summary point metrics but in a form that allows accessible, interpretive exploration through drilling down or ‘peeling the onion’ of any rich analysis.</mark>
