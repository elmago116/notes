Bibliometrics consists of a statistical technique to either
map the state of the art or to identify research opportunities in a given field of study
(Oliveira et al. 2019). #bibliometrics

The first step in meta-interpretation is to identify the research area for
the synthesis, rather than a research question.

of all the key dimensions of the problem that have been researched (i.e., the different

paradigm; and (iii) treats conflicting findings as higher order data, and explain them
in terms of contestation among the different paradigms from which the data were
generated.

> Scientific knowledge can be considered as a complex system. Therefore, it requires a network structure to outline the interaction among its main elements (GutiérrezSalcedo et al. 2017). In Bibliometrics, this network is composed of nodes, which stands for publications, journals, researchers, or keywords, and edges that depict the relationship between pairs of nodes (Van Eck and Waltman 2014). Regarding Scientific Mapping, the objective is to build bibliometric networks by which it is possible to identify how scientific knowledge is conceptually structured (Cobo et al. 2011b). In this sense, three categories of bibliometric networks can be found in the literature: (i) collaboration networks, (ii) conceptual networks, and (iii) citation networks.
