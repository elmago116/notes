## Abstract

In recent years, there has been a growing interest from the digital humanities in knowledge graphs as data modelling paradigm. Already, this has led to the creation of many such knowledge graphs, many of which are now available as part of the Linked Open Data cloud. This presents new opportunities for data mining. In this work, we develop, implement, and evaluate (both data-driven and user-driven) an end-to-end pipeline for user-centric pattern mining on knowledge graphs in the humanities. This pipeline combines constrained generalized association rule mining with natural language output and facet rule browsing to allow for transparency and interpretability—two key domain requirements. Experiments in the archaeological domain show that domain experts were positively surprised by the range of patterns that were discovered and were overall optimistic about the future potential of this approach.
