### Abstract

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe the concept of the Semantic Web, as well as the technologies necessary for its implementation. The paper analyses current research on the use of Semantic Web technologies in the GLAM field. The aim is to find out what are the results of the research and what are the advantages and disadvantages of using Semantic Web technologies in the field of GLAM. Method/approach: A descriptive method was used to describe a brief history of the Web, the concept and technologies of the Semantic Web, and the Records in Contexts model. A literature review method was used to analyse previous research on the use of the Semantic Web in the field of GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums) and in the field of archival studies. Results: Twenty articles from the databases ProQuest, SCOPUS, Emerald Insight and UNPAYWALL were analysed in the context of the Semantic Web and its application in the field of archival studies. Eleven articles related to GLAM and nine articles related to archives were identified and analysed. Conclusions/findings: More and more institutions in the field of GLAM are publishing their inventories online and, in this context, there is a growing body of research on the use of Semantic Web technologies to facilitate the identification of material and to increase accessibility and usability. © 2024 International Institute for Archival Science Trieste - Maribor.
