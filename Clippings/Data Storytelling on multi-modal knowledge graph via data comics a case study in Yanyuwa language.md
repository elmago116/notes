## Abstract

This paper pioneers a study of storytelling on a multi-modal and multi-grained #bibliometrics/KW knowledge graph of the Yanyuwa #themes/language - a critically endangered #themes/HerStory/misrepresented Indigenous Australian language. Unlike traditional <mark class="hltr-blue">data management technologies</mark> (e.g., relational database), the knowledge graph is capable of connecting individual unit of entities (e.g., people, location or an abstract concept) to their cultural significance (e.g., oral traditions, historical context, examples of the concept), which is crucial for capturing the cultural and historical significance embedded in languages to support various #design/stakeholders (e.g., indigenous educators) to revive the language. To ensure that the knowledge encoded can be accessible and understandable to non-technical stakeholders, who typically have no prior knowledge about the knowledge graph, this paper investigate a data comic approach to transform complex graphical knowledge into narratives that are easier to understand and more engaging for the non-technical audience. We report on: (i) technical details involved in constructing the knowledge graph; (ii) processes involved in transforming a graph segment into a narrated knowledge stories; and (iii) the design and prototyping process of the eventual data comic visualisations carried out by the three knowledge graph engineers. In doing so, we contributes novel insights regarding the role of data storytelling under the circumstances of employing a technically advanced solution like knowledge graph in the longstanding challenge of reviving endangered indigenous languages.
