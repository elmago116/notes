[[Extracting Semantic Frames from Specialized Corpora for Lexicographic Purposes.pdf]]

This is the official website for the FrameNet Project.

If you just want to explore, please type a word or phrase into the "Search" box at the upper right; this will look for the word in the FrameNet database. (Verbs are more likely to give interesting results than nouns.)

For a more structured approach to learning about FrameNet, please begin with the ["About"](https://www.google.com/) link above.

Almost all of the FrameNet data can be reached by browsing this website - you do not need a login to browse. If you need a machine-readable copy of the data in XML format, please click on the "Get the Data" button or select "FrameNet Data/Request FrameNet Data".

Thanks. - Collin Baker, Project Manager
