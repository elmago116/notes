### Abstract

The purpose of this study is to conduct a comprehensive systematic literature review, bibliometric analysis, and content analysis of design thinking (DT). To identify the research papers, a systematic literature review was done. After reading, all titles of the articles, abstract, keywords, and full-length articles based on the requirement, unrelated articles to design thinking were removed. In the second step, articles were read more critically. Finally, bibliometric and content analyses of the selected articles were carried out. Content analysis was done based on bibliometric coupling between the selected article and the recent article. The paper identified sixteen existing research diversification in design thinking. An indistinct interpretation of the progress of research article publication, research diversification on theme and subtheme of 16 clusters, present research trends, and five prospective research directions on design thinking has been identified here. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.
