Abstract
Background: The field of Artificial Intelligence has undergone cyclical periods of growth and decline,
known as AI summers and winters. Currently, we are in the third AI summer, characterized by significant
advancements and commercialization, particularly in the integration of Symbolic AI and Sub-Symbolic
AI, leading to the emergence of Neuro-Symbolic AI.
Contributions: (1) A definition of Meta-Cognition within Neuro-Symbolic AI. (2) A review of the key
themes of the literature post the Neuro-Symbolic research explosion from 2020-2024. (3) Identification of
the current gaps in the literature of Neuro-Symbolic AI
Objective: This paper provides a systematic literature review of Neuro-Symbolic AI projects within
the 2020-24 AI landscape, highlighting key developments, methodologies, and applications. It aims to
identify where quality efforts are focused in 2024 and pinpoint existing research gaps in the field.
Methods: The review followed the PRISMA methodology, utilizing databases such as IEEE Explore,
Google Scholar, arXiv, ACM, and SpringerLink. The inclusion criteria targeted peer-reviewed papers
published between 2020 and 2024. Papers were screened for relevance to Neuro-Symbolic AI, with further
inclusion based on the availability of associated codebases to ensure reproducibility.
Results: From an initial pool of 1,428 papers, 167 met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed in
detail. The majority of research efforts are concentrated in the areas of learning and inference (63%),
logic and reasoning (35%), and knowledge representation (44%). Explainability and trustworthiness are
less represented (28%), with Meta-Cognition being the least explored area (5%). The review identifies
significant interdisciplinary opportunities, particularly in integrating explainability and trustworthiness
with other research areas.
Discussion: The findings reveal a well-integrated body of work in learning and inference, logic
and reasoning, and knowledge representation. However, there is a notable gap in research focused on
explainability and trustworthiness, which is critical for the deployment of reliable AI systems. The
sparse representation of Meta-Cognition highlights the need for further research to develop frameworks
that enable AI systems to self-monitor, evaluate, and adjust their processes, enhancing autonomy and
adaptability.
Conclusion: Neuro-Symbolic AI research has seen rapid growth since 2020, with concentrated efforts
in learning and inference. Significant gaps remain in explainability, trustworthiness, and Meta-Cognition.
Addressing these gaps through interdisciplinary research will be crucial for advancing the field towards
more intelligent, reliable, and context-aware AI systems.

1. Introduction
The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has experienced significant cyclical growth, known as AI
summers and winters. At present, we as a community find ourselves in the third AI summer,
marked by rapid scientific advances and commercialization, continuing the legacy of previous
periods of AI excitement followed by setbacks [1]. A significant product of the third AI summer
has been the integration of two prominent fields of AI; Symbolic AI and Sub-Symbolic AI,
the fusion of which is known as Neuro-Symbolic AI. There is an ongoing debate about the
necessity of Neuro-Symbolic AI [2], opponents arguing that common sense reasoning can be
addressed through the use of big data [3] and proponents arguing that “You can’t get to the
moon by climbing successively taller trees” [4]. For this systematic review, we take the stance
that symbolic AI is essential and that Neuro-Symbolic AI represents the best way forward for
the community hence, this paper provides a systematic literature review of prominent Neuro-
Symbolic projects within the 2024 AI landscape, highlighting key developments, methodologies,
and applications.
1.1. Symbolic AI
Symbolic AI is a “a sub-field of AI concerned with learning the internal symbolic representations
of the world around it” where we can “ translate some form of implicit human knowledge into
a more formalized and declarative form based on rules and logic” [ 2]. Examples of some of
the earliest AI systems that utilised symbolic representations include SHRDLU [5], ELIZA [6],
DENDRAL [7] and MYCIN[8] and examples of some of the newest AI systems which heavily
utilise symbolic processes include ConceptNet 5.5 [9] CYC [10] and Good Old Fashioned AI
(GOFAI) planning systems [11] to name just a few.
1.2. Sub-Symbolic AI
By contrast, Sub-Symbolic AI are systems that “do not require rules or symbolic representations
as inputs” and instead “learn implicit data representations on their own” [2]. Sub-Symbolic AI
encompasses approaches such as machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI, which
rely on algorithms to automatically extract patterns from raw data to discern relationships and
make predictions based on learned representations. Examples of some of the earliest AI systems
that utilised sub-symbolic representations include the Perceptron [12], Hopfield Networks [13]
and the Backpropagation Algorithm [14] and examples of some of the newest sub-symbolic
systems include famous projects such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models
[15], the YOLO family of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN’S) [16] and the DALLE diffusion
model transformer [17] to again just name a few.
1.3. Neuro-Symbolic AI
There is at present a debate within the AI community surrounding the need for Neuro-Symbolic
AI [18]. Simply described, the argument for Neuro-Symbolic AI draws on Kahneman (2011) [19]
concepts of System 1 and System 2 thinking whereby System 1 is fast, intuitive, and parallel,
akin to the capabilities of deep learning, while System 2 is slow, deliberate, and sequential,
2

Brandon C. Colelough et al. CEUR Workshop Proceedings 1–19
resembling symbolic reasoning and hence, Neuro-Symbolic AI aims to combine these two
approaches to create systems that benefit from the strengths of both. We Adopt the definition
provided by Garcez and Lamb (2023) [ 18]; Hence, Neuro-Symbolic AI is “a composite AI
framework that seeks to merge the domains of Symbolic AI and Neural Networks” [or
more broadly put, Sub-Symbolic AI] “to create a superior hybrid AI model possessing
reasoning capabilities”. As this definition is quite broad, for the purpose of this systematic
review, we will further define the sub-components of the Neuro-Symbolic AI taxonomy we
believe to be most relevant to the current AI landscape within section 2.
2. Methodology
2.1. Taxonomy of Neuro-Symbolic AI
We identified five foundational research areas advancing the state of the art in Neuro-Symbolic
AI. This taxonomy was synthesized from a review of six survey papers [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]
and four seminal books [2, 26, 27, 28]. These areas are:
1. Knowledge Representation: Integrating symbolic and neural representations and
developing commonsense and domain-specific knowledge graphs [20, 26, 28].
2. Learning and Inference: Combining learning and reasoning processes through end-to-
end differentiable reasoning and dynamic multi-source knowledge reasoning [21, 22, 2].
3. Explainability and Trustworthiness: Creating interpretable models and reasoning
processes to ensure trust and reliability in Neuro-Symbolic systems [23, 24].
4. Logic and Reasoning: Integrating logic-based methods with neural networks, including
logical and probabilistic reasoning, and the syntax and semantics of Neuro-Symbolic
systems [23, 28].
5. Meta-Cognition: The system’s capacity to monitor, evaluate, and adjust its own reason-
ing and learning processes by integrating neural networks and symbolic representations.
The four above categories represent the core technical areas where current efforts are con-
centrated. Additionally, we define Meta-Cognition to address a gap in current taxonomies
that fail to capture fields encompassing self-awareness, adaptive learning, reflective reasoning,
self-regulation, and introspective monitoring.
2.2. Meta-Cognition
Meta-Cognition refers to the processes that involve thinking about one’s thinking, enabling
self-awareness and self-regulation in cognitive tasks. Meta-Cognition is the controller that sits
above the cognitive tasks of systems to direct energy effectively towards the correct system to
handle a task. This higher-order cognition is crucial for tasks that require reflection, planning,
and adaptation. Its importance lies in its ability to enhance learning, problem-solving, and
3

decision-making, making it a key focus in Neuro-Symbolic AI. Present research within Neuro-
Symbolic AI does not yet effectively cover meta-cognition and neglecting Meta-Cognition in
Neuro-Symbolic AI research limits system autonomy, adaptability, and reliability, hindering
error correction and reducing trustworthiness in dynamic environments, making self-awareness
and self-regulation essential for future advancements.
2.3. Literature Review Approach
We followed the PRISMA systematic review methodology to ensure a thorough and unbiased
survey of the literature. Our search was conducted across five databases: IEEE Explore, Google
Scholar, arXiv, ACM Digital Library, and SpringerLink Library, focusing on publications from
2020 to 2024. The keywords included "Neuro-Symbolic" combined with terms related to the
foundational research areas. Only peer-reviewed articles, conference papers, and books in
English were considered. From an initial broad search, we refined our selection to 392 candidate
papers, which were further screened for quality, relevance, and availability of a public codebase,
resulting in 167 papers that were included in our review. This streamlined process allowed
us to focus on the most relevant and high-quality research, identifying key findings and open
problems in Neuro-Symbolic AI.

The search terms "neurosymbolic" AND each of the terms required for the 5 foundational research areas
within neurosymbolic AI were queried through the 5 databases. The number of pieces of literature
returned from each query is shown in the table above. Note also that only publications from 2020-2024
were considered
From the initial Google Scholar scraping, there was a total of 957 publications listed on Google
Scholar alone from 1970 til the present. Figure 1 shows how research on Neuro-Symbolic AI is
increasing exponentially starting in 2020, with notable increases in the years beginning from
2020 (53 publications), and peaking in 2023 (236 publications). Combining the Google Scholar
literature from 2020 onwards with the literature from the four other databases queried for pieces
of literature on Neuro-Symbolic AI from 2020 onwards, a total of 1,428 papers were extracted as
illustrated in table 1. An illustration of this sub-categorisation showing the overlap between 4
of the 5 main research focal areas is shown in Figure 2. From the total literature extracted, 45%
(n = 641) were removed as duplicate entries, and 28% (n = 395) were removed during title and

the literature was further split based on code/model availability. 42% of the papers (n = 167) had
associated code-base repositories (e.g. GitHub, Huggingface etc.) and 58% (n = 225) were further
excluded from this literature review as a public code-base could not be found for the associated
piece of literature (except for entries on Meta-Cognition as no code-bases could be found for
literature associated with this category). The remaining 167 papers gathered were then read in
detail and a further 9 papers were removed for not meeting the inclusion criteria leaving 158
included papers and 234 excluded papers. These 158 papers were then sub-categorised under the
five main focal research areas and the intersection found therein. There were 44% (n=70) entries
in the Knowledge Representation category, 63% (n=99) entries in the Learning and Inference

4. Discussion & Open Questions
To build upon the existing literature that has thoroughly summarized the Neuro-Symbolic
landscape before 2020, we extend this discussion by analyzing the most influential projects in
each sub-field of Neuro-Symbolic AI published since 2020. This section aims to highlight state-
of-the-art (SOTA) technologies available to researchers, showcasing significant advancements
and ongoing challenges.
4.1. Knowledge Representation
Research in Knowledge Representation has focused on advancing semantic grounding, rep-
resenting complex relationships, and improving data efficacy. Development of commonsense
knowledge bases and event-based representations [ 107, 105, 106] has advanced AI’s under-
standing of daily events, aiming to reduce error rates in text generation. These works are
furthered through the exploration of minimal data requirements for commonsense knowledge
in few-shot learning models[110], and the use of Neuro-Symbolic representations to enhance
training efficiency and reduce costs [161]. Additionally, refinement of knowledge representation
was demonstrated by predicting complex relationships and embedding techniques in knowl-
edge graphs [111, 109], and the integration of personalized knowledge was demonstrated to
ensure narrative consistency in storytelling agents [130]. NeuroQL, a domain-specific language
for inter-subjective reasoning, captured complex and long-range relationships, demonstrat-
ing how Neuro-Symbolic approaches can ‘do more with less’, yielding significant savings in
training time and environmental impact [108]. Open research questions remain around how
Neuro-Symbolic AI can enhance the dynamic interpretation and manipulation of symbols,
develop meta-cognitive abilities to monitor and adjust reasoning processes, and ensure trans-
parent, explainable reasoning pathways for more human-like, adaptable, and robust knowledge
representation.
4.2. Learning and Inference
Within Learning and Inference, research has focused on Neuro-Symbolic Integration for En-
hanced Learning, Advanced Problem Solving and Decision Making, and Semantic Enhancement
for Model Trustworthiness. Neuro-Symbolic integration for Enhanced Learning was demon-
strated through the fusion of symbolic reasoning with neural learning mechanisms which
adapted commonsense knowledge for few-shot settings and transformed observations into
logical facts using Logical Neural Networks [84, 64]. Advanced Problem Solving and Decision
Making are highlighted by Plan-SOFAI [92] and the ZeroC architecture [160], which leverage
Neuro-Symbolic methods to enhance AI planning and zero-shot concept recognition to integrate
7

Brandon C. Colelough et al. CEUR Workshop Proceedings 1–19
the fast and slow thinking models and the improve machine generalization. Semantic Enhance-
ment and Model Trustworthiness were demonstrated by the introduction of a Pseudo-Semantic
Loss for autoregressive models which integrated logic within the loss function [122] and neural
networks utilising Logic Tensor Networks [79] which aim to boost logical consistency, reduce
model toxicity, and enhance prediction accuracy by concentrating on relevant constraints. Open
research questions remain in Neuro-Symbolic AI, including how to develop incremental learning
that allows symbolic systems to evolve with new experiences, create context-aware inference
mechanisms that adjust reasoning based on situational cues, achieve fine-grained explainability
for complex inference chains, and explore meta-cognitive abilities enabling systems to monitor,
evaluate, and optimize their learning processes in dynamic environments.
4.3. Explainability and Trustworthiness
Research centred on Explainability and Trustworthiness within Neuro-Symbolic AI has looked
to advance Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques, Enhancing Logical Reasoning, and
Refining Language Understanding and Summarization. Braid introduced a logical reasoner with
probabilistic rules to tackle the brittle matching problem, merging symbolic and neural knowl-
edge to enhance logical reasoning [119]. Similarly, Structure-Aware Abstractive Conversation
improved summarization by incorporating discourse relations, action triples, and structured
graphs for precise, context-rich summaries, advancing NLP techniques [117]. Semantic-level
revisions identifying and correcting “confounders” in Neuro-Symbolic scenes have improved AI
decision-making clarity, fostering trust and enhancing logical reasoning by making processes
more understandable [ 166]. Evaluating AI’s humour comprehension with the New Yorker
Cartoon Caption Contest underscored the need for nuanced understanding, refining language
processing in complex cognitive tasks [118]. FactPEGASUS focuses on ensuring factuality in
summarization by optimizing pre-training and fine-tuning methods, crucial for maintaining
summary integrity and refining language understanding [135]. Complementing this, Neuro-
Symbolic methods enhance explainable short answer grading through logical reasoning and
cue detection, bridging AI capabilities with human-like responses and advancing NLP tech-
niques [121]. Open research questions remain around how Neuro-Symbolic AI can adapt and
evolve symbolic representations in real-time to maintain transparency, integrate meta-cognitive
mechanisms for self-monitoring and adjustment of reasoning strategies, develop explainable
NLP techniques for complex cognitive tasks, and ensure factual consistency in AI outputs while
providing clear, detailed explanations of the underlying reasoning process.
4.4. Logic and Reasoning
From the research field of Neuro-Symbolic Logic and Reasoning, the research has gravitated
largely toward the Integration of Logical Reasoning and Probabilistic Models, Commonsense
Knowledge and Language Understanding, and Enhanced Decision-Making. Logical Credal
Networks [36] combines logical reasoning with probabilistic models to handle imprecise infor-
mation, while DeepStochLog [75] enhances traditional logic programming with neural networks
for complex reasoning tasks. 2P-Kt [37] offers a comprehensive logic-based framework sup-
porting various reasoning tasks and integrating symbolic and sub-symbolic AI. Research into
8

Brandon C. Colelough et al. CEUR Workshop Proceedings 1–19
Commonsense Knowledge and Language Understanding includes kogito, [ 106], which gen-
erates commonsense knowledge inferences from textual input to enhance AI adaptability,
and LinkBERT [88], which improves language understanding and reasoning capabilities by
incorporating document links, particularly in multi-hop reasoning tasks. For Enhanced Decision-
Making, “Neuro-Symbolic Commonsense Social Reasoning” [44] integrates Neuro-Symbolic
methods in autonomous systems, while LASER [135] combines neural networks’ flexibility with
the precision of symbolic logic. “Getting from Generative AI to Trustworthy AI” [10] addresses
LLMs’ limitations in trustworthiness and reasoning, proposing integration with symbolic AI
systems for reliability. Open research questions remain around how Neuro-Symbolic AI can
develop scalable frameworks that integrate traditional logic programming with neural networks
for complex reasoning tasks, incorporate commonsense knowledge and advanced language
understanding to enhance multi-hop reasoning capabilities, combine symbolic logic with neural
networks to ensure reliable and trustworthy decision-making and integrate meta-cognitive
abilities to enable self-monitoring and adjustment of reasoning strategies for clearer, more
understandable explanations.
4.5. Intersections of the above four research areas
Much of the literature is cross-sectional between the four areas of research; Explainability &
Trustworthiness, Knowledge Representation, Learning & Inference and Logic & Reasoning.
AlphaGeometry [29], which is a Neuro-Symbolic system designed to solve Euclidean plane
geometry problems at the Olympiad level, stands out as a prominent project that sits at the inter-
section of all four. AlphaGeometry’s ability to synthesise millions of theorems and proofs, using
a neural language model trained on large-scale synthetic data to guide a symbolic deduction
engine, makes it a groundbreaking example of how Neuro-Symbolic AI can achieve advanced
problem-solving capabilities, bridging gaps across multiple domains of AI research. However,
there is a distinct lack of integration with the explainability and trustworthiness fields within
the unions of the other three research areas as the density of research intersection at the unions
of explainability and trustworthiness and the other three research areas is relatively sparse,
indicating a significant opportunity for further interdisciplinary work in Neuro-Symbolic AI.
4.6. Meta-Cognition
Recent advancements in this domain showcase Reinforcement learning (RL) to approximate
Meta-Cognition, approaches to integrate cognitive architectures with LLMs to approximate meta-
cognitive capabilities and the integration of many AI architectures and systems to demonstrate
the Common Model of Cognition (CMC). The benefits of integrating symbolic features with RL
algorithms were demonstrated through meta-reinforcement learning combined with logical
program induction to improve financial trading strategies [173]. Enhancing general intelligence
by fusing cognitive architectures with LLMs was investigated, creating embodied agents that
leverage the strengths of both approaches [169, 170]. Improvements in experiential models were
achieved by using LLMs to convert descriptive information into dense signals for instance-based
learning [171]. Adaptive conflict resolution in AI was enhanced by coupling cognitive reasoning
with generative algorithms [172]. Robust AI systems were developed through modular, agency,
9

Brandon C. Colelough et al. CEUR Workshop Proceedings 1–19
and Neuro-Symbolic approaches to combine LLMs with cognitive architectures [174, 175]. These
projects align with the CMC, integrating cognitive architectures like ACT-R, Soar, and Sigma to
provide a unified framework for human cognition [178]. Enhancements in AI robustness and
interoperability were achieved by integrating cognitive architectures with foundation models
for cognitively guided few-shot learning [167]. Finally, combining generative networks with
the CMC using a Neuro-Symbolic approach merged symbolic reasoning with neural networks
to replicate human cognitive processes for powerful, explainable AI systems has been theorised
but not yet realised[176]. Open research questions remain around how Neuro-Symbolic AI can
integrate symbolic reasoning with meta-reinforcement learning for complex decision-making,
fuse cognitive architectures with LLMs to develop meta-cognitive agents, leverage LLMs to
enhance instance-based learning through meta-cognitive signals, create adaptive meta-cognitive
frameworks for real-time conflict resolution, combine modular and agency approaches to build
meta-cognitive AI systems aligned with the Common Model of Cognition, improve few-shot
learning with cognitive architectures for meta-cognitive awareness, and develop Neuro-Symbolic
generative networks that replicate human-like meta-cognitive processes.
5. Meta-Cognition in Neuro-Symbolic AI
Whilst the initial representation of Neuro-Symbolic AI as system 1 and system 2 level thinking
is a useful tool to goal-orientate the field towards a common direction for the integration of
neural and symbolic processes, the current adaptation of the human-level cognitive processing
ability is too simplistic and does not yet capture the full systems-level breakdown of where
the community should be investing effort to push the field forward. As Kahneman himself
states, “the two systems do not really exist in the brain or anywhere else. ’System 1 does X’ is
a shortcut for ’X occurs automatically. ’ And ’System 2 is mobilized to do Y’ is a shortcut for
’arousal increases, pupils dilate, attention is focused, and activity Y is performed. ’”. Human-level
cognition manifests from a deeply complex and intricately layered yet densely connected box of
systems of systems that work in unification and act with system-1 system-2 characteristics. The
goal of the Neuro-Symbolic research domain is to “create a superior hybrid AI model possessing
reasoning capabilities” and hence, to push the field further towards this goal we must seek to
design and build systems that act with the same propensity as Kahnemans system-1 system-2
character setup through the implementation of more integrated systems of systems controlled
through Meta-Cognition possessing the ability to act lazily when necessary and focused when
required.
6. Conclusion
The field of Neuro-Symbolic AI has experienced a notable surge in research activity from 2020
onwards, reflecting the growing recognition of the importance of integrating symbolic and
sub-symbolic approaches to enhance AI’s reasoning capabilities. The contribution from this sys-
tematic literature review is a well-grounded definition of Meta-Cognition within Neuro-Symbolic
AI, a review of the key themes of the literature post the Neuro-Symbolic research explosion
from 2020-2024 and an identification of the current gaps in the literature of Neuro-Symbolic AI.

Brandon C. Colelough et al. CEUR Workshop Proceedings 1–19
We found that the majority of the research efforts in between 2020-24 were concentrated in the
areas of learning and inference, with a significant portion also dedicated to logic and reasoning,
as well as knowledge representation. These areas have seen substantial advancements, with
innovative projects and methodologies pushing the boundaries of what AI systems can achieve
in terms of understanding, reasoning, and generating human-like responses. However, our
review also identifies several critical gaps in the current literature. Despite the substantial
progress in learning and inference, there remains a relative sparseness of research focused on
explainability and trustworthiness. This gap is particularly concerning given the increasing
deployment of AI systems in real-world applications, where transparency and reliability are
paramount. Moreover, the intersection of the four main research areas—learning and inference,
logic and reasoning, knowledge representation, and explainability and trustworthiness—reveals
a significant opportunity for interdisciplinary work. The density of studies that effectively com-
bine these domains indicates the field is generally well integrated. The most underrepresented
area in our review is Meta-Cognition. This emerging field, which involves systems’ capacity to
monitor, evaluate, and adjust their own reasoning and learning processes, holds great potential
for advancing AI towards more autonomous and adaptable intelligence. The few existing studies
in this domain suggest promising directions, but much more work is needed to develop robust
frameworks and practical implementations of Meta-Cognitive architectures.
