# Scientometrics

In subject area: [Social Sciences](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences)

Scientometrics refers to the study of the quantitative aspects of scientific communication, research and development practices, and science and technology policies. It involves analyzing patterns and characteristics of authors and documents using techniques such as citation analysis. Scientometrics helps provide indicators for science and technology policy processes and research and development management.

## [Scientometrics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0080430767032009)

Scientometrics can be defined as the study of the quantitative aspects of scientific communication, R&D practices, and science and technology (S&T) policies. The specialty has developed in relation to the increased capacities of computer storage and information retrieval of scientific communications (e.g., citation analysis). Archival records of scientific communications contain institutional address information, substantive messages (e.g., title words), and relational information from which one is able to reconstruct patterns and identify the latent characteristics of both authors and document sets. Using scientometric techniques, one is thus able to relate institutional characteristics at the level of research groups with developments at the level of scientific disciplines and specialties. Citations, for example, can be used for retrieving documents on the basis of author names, or vice versa. The scientometric representation is formal and subsymbolic: it remains in need of an interpretation. The focus on uncertainty contained in the distribution relates scientometrics additionally to the (neo-evolutionary) study of complex and adaptive systems. Simulation models are increasingly used for study of the role of science-based technologies in innovation processes. However, the specialty remains data driven because of its mission to provide indicators to S&T policy processes and R&D management.

### Introduction

Scientometrics can be defined as the “quantitative study of science, communication in science, and science policy” (Hess, 1997: p. 75). What started as Eugene Garfield's idea of an index to improve information retrieval in the 1960s and resulted in the creation of the *Science Citation Index* (SCI) (Garfield, 1979; Wouters, 1999) was soon recognized as a novel instrument in the empirical study of the sciences (e.g., de Solla Price, 1965; Cole and Cole, 1973). The availability of output indicators (such as databases of publications and patents) complemented ongoing efforts by the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in [Paris](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/paris "Learn more about Paris from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") to standardize input statistics of the scientific [enterprise](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/company "Learn more about enterprise from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (OECD, 1963/1976). Based on these data, the National Science Board of the United States initiated the biannual series of *Science Indicators* in 1972. (The series was renamed into *Science and Engineering Indicators* in 1987 (National Science Board, 2012).)

The new journal *Scientometrics* was launched in 1978 and in that same year leading historians, philosophers of science, and social scientists – among them Robert K. Merton – published an edited volume entitled *Toward a Metric of Science: The Advent of Science Indicators*, in which they reflected on the new perspectives (Elkana et al., 1978). The historian Derek J. de Solla Price published a number of books and articles in the 1960s and 1970s which laid the foundations for the newly emerging field of quantitative science studies (e.g., de Solla Price, 1961, 1963, 1965), culminating in a full-fledged research program (de Solla Price, 1976).

The sociology of science, however, during the 1980s turned increasingly toward microanalysis focusing on the behavior of scientists in laboratories (e.g., Latour and Woolgar, 1979). From this perspective, the quantitative analysis of scientific literature at the macro (e.g., disciplinary) level was not considered a useful tool to explain scientific practices (Edge, 1979). Rather, with its focus on scientific communications – as a unit of analysis potentially different from scientists as authors – scientometrics developed at arm's length from the sociology of science and closer to the [library and information sciences](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/library-and-information-science "Learn more about library and information sciences from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). At the same time, the value of scientometric indicators for informing science policies and research management became manifest (Irvine and Martin, 1984).

Under these diverging pressures, the field of [science and technology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/science-and-technology "Learn more about science and technology from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") studies increasingly bifurcated during the period 1985–2000 into qualitative ‘sociology of scientific knowledge’ on the one side, and the quantitative study of scientometrics and science indicators, on the other. Additionally, a third line of research emerged that published articles that use insights from the quantitative study of science and technology for evaluation and policy purposes. Such research appeared in journals such as *Research Policy*, *Research Evaluation*, and *Technology Analysis* & *[Strategic Management](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/strategic-management "Learn more about Strategic Management from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")* (Leydesdorff and Van den Besselaar, 1997).

During the 2000s, attention to evaluation and ranking was further enhanced after the publication of the first Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) of the Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2004 (Shin et al., 2011). The use of impact factors of journals for evaluative purposes has in the meantime pervaded the academic environment, even to the level of individual tenure decisions, which increasingly are being based on quantitative measures of publications and citations. Another popular indicator, the *h*\-index (Hirsch, 2005), provides a simple impact metric for individual authors that can readily be used in online searching, for example, with Google Scholar, but is also incorporated in the major citation databases such as the Web-of-Science and Scopus. Computer programs (e.g., *Publish or Perish* at http://www.harzing.com/pop.htm) can freely be downloaded from the Internet and allow for measuring numbers of publications, citations, *h*\-index, *g*\-index (Egghe, 2006), etc., at the level of individuals, journals, and institutions without much [prior knowledge](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/prior-knowledge "Learn more about prior knowledge from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of the scientometrics involved. In the meantime, the production and improvement of these indicators has become organized in university departments, spin-offs, and relevant companies such as Elsevier and Thomson-Reuters.

The increased access to large datasets through the Internet led to the development of the network sciences as part of computing and applied physics during the first decade of this century (e.g., Newman, 2010). A number of these studies used coauthorship and citation data for modeling the network dynamics. Although these efforts to model the evolution of the sciences statistically (e.g., Scharnhorst et al., 2012) often do not aim at contributing to social–scientific understanding and theorizing, the new methods (e.g., visualization techniques) developed by these researchers are partly derived from and have also been adopted by scientometricians. Such interdisciplinary exchanges make scientometrics an active research specialty that in the 2000s has been experiencing a spectacular growth in its literature. More recently, the specialty has come to increasingly be considered as a ‘research front’ in terms of the turnover of the referencing patterns (Milojević and Leydesdorff, 2013; Wouters and Leydesdorff, 1994).

### Numbers are not data and data are not indicators

The central paradigm of scientometrics is that science or scientific research as a system has *quantitative aspects* that *can be characterised* by mathematical (mainly statistical) methods. According to Holton (1978) ‘… nothing is more natural than to develop indicators about science that themselves consist of quantifiable measures’. Scientometrics is concerned primarily with the description of regularities in the production, flow and application of information in science. In order to characterise information phenomena quantitatively, *reliable data* must be obtained, *appropriate methods* and *relevant indicators* must be constructed and applied (Moravcsik, 1988).

According to Braun *et al.* (1985): ‘Statistical indicators are selected or constructed from empirical statistical data, in a way to form a [coherent system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/coherent-system "Learn more about coherent system from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") based explicitly or implicitly on some theoretical model of the phenomenon under study.’

The recommendations of the first international Science & Technology Indicators Conference (OECD 1990, Paris) state: ‘Science and technology indicators are series of data designed to answer a specific question about the existing state of and/or changes in, the [science and technology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/science-and-technology "Learn more about science and technology from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") endeavor, its internal structure, its relation with the outside world and the degree to which it is meeting the goals set by those within and without.’

Holton (1978) defines scientometric indicators as follows: the indicator is ‘… a measure that explicitly tests some assumption, hypothesis, or theory; for mere data, these underlying assumptions, hypotheses, or theories usually remain implicit. Indicators are the more sophisticated result of a complex interaction between theory and measurement.’

According to van Raan (2004): ‘An indicator is the result of a specific mathematical operation (often simple arithmetic) with data. The mere number of citations of one publication in a certain time period is data. The measure in which such citation counts of all publications of a research group in a particular field are normalized to citation counts of all publications worldwide in the same field, is an indicator. An indicator is a measure that explicitly addresses some assumption.’ He adds: ‘Indicators must be problem driven, otherwise they are useless.’ The indicators are ‘… instruments in the study of science’.

From the above it is clear that indicators are more than simple data: ‘… they can guide one eventually to an understanding of the basic features that are associated with, but *not* exhaustively motivated, described, or explained by conceptions expressible in numeric terms – basic features described in such terms as simplicity, symmetry, harmony, order, and coherence …’ (Holton, 1978). He further states: ‘The indicators cannot be thought of as given from “above”, or detached from the theoretical framework, or as unable to undergo changes in actual use. They should preferably be developed in response to and as aids in the solution of interesting questions and problems.’ It follows that scientometric indicators can ‘… rationalize the allocation and use of resources’.

The definition of scientometric indicators may be given as follows (Vinkler, 1988a, 2001): *scientometric indicators* are measures with or without units which can characterize a single or several aspects of science or scientific research quantitatively and can be attributed to a single or several scientometric systems (see Chapters 2 and 3).

Price (1978) described the method in creating an indicator as follows: ‘… find the most simple pattern in the data at hand, and then look for the more complex patterns which modify the first. What should be constructed from the data is not a number but a pattern, a cluster of points on a map, a peak on a graph, a correlation of significant elements on a matrix, a qualitative similarity between two histograms. If these patterns are found, the next step is to suggest models that produce such patterns and to test these models by further data.’

According to Kochen (1978): ‘An indicator is required to correspond faithfully to the trends it is intended to measure or forecast – for example, the number of publications must correspond roughly to increases or decreases in scientific productivity.’ In accordance with this, Porter (1977) assumes that: ‘The essence of indicators is prediction.’

The requirements for scientometric indicators can be summarised as follows (Moore and Shiskin, 1967):

■

statistical adequacy,

■

assurance,

■

good coverage,

■

sensitivity to changes,

■

currency,

■

smoothness of the [time series](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/time-series "Learn more about time series from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"),

■

efficiency of measurement,

■

ease of interpretation.

According to F. Crick, ‘Communication is the essence of science’ (preface to Garwey, 1979). The first step in communicating via publications (see Chapter 8) is publishing the results attained. What *publication* means in science is summarised by Price (1963) as follows: ‘The act of creation in scientific research is incomplete without publication, for it is publication that provides the corrective process, the evaluation, and perhaps the assent of the relevant scientific community.’ The publication ‘… is in a strong sense the final product of the research.’ From the above it follows that indicators referring to publications represent the most important group of scientometric indices.

The main characteristics of scientific publications are as follows (Vinkler, 1998b). They:

■

contain information pertaining to original scientific results or a survey and assessment of scientific results already published,

■

are disclosed to the relevant scientific public,

■

have passed through appropriate peer reviewing processes,

■

and are recorded in permanently available forms, and

■

in a format based on tradition and common use.

A paramount requirement of any scientific paper is that the results published must be repeatable by any qualified researcher in the field (see also Chapter 12).

A short review on the validation of scientometric indicators is given in Moed (2005, chapters 18 and 19), and the reader is also referred to Virgo (1977), Schubert and Glänzel (1983), Schubert and Braun (1986) and Plomp (1989). Glänzel and Schubert (1995) discussed predictions based on stochastic citation processes and their reliability.

In summary, citation-based indices can be validated by peer review, and the results of peer evaluations may be validated through citation indicators. Consequently, according to the idea of *converging partial indicators* (Martin and Irvine, 1983, 1984; Irvine and Martin, 1984), we may accept the results of an assessment as valid if several appropriately selected indicators lead to the same conclusion (see Chapter 12).

Reviews by King (1987), Todorov and Glänzel (1988), Vinkler (1988a) and Moed (2000) provide surveys of the types and [application potential](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/potential-application "Learn more about application potential from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of publication and citation indicators.

The appropriate selection of indicators is essential in studying publications of different scientometric systems. Accordingly,

■

the *function* of the indicator(s) applied should be determined,

■

the *method* of the calculation should be given, and

■

*applicability* and *validity* of the indicator(s) should be studied within the conditions of the corresponding system.

### Abstract

This article provides an overview of the field of scientometrics, that is, the study of science, technology, and innovation from a quantitative perspective. We cover major historical milestones in the development of this specialism from the 1960s to today and discuss its relationship with the [sociology of scientific knowledge](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/sociology-of-scientific-knowledge "Learn more about sociology of scientific knowledge from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), the [library and information sciences](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/library-and-information-science "Learn more about library and information sciences from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), and science policy issues such as indicator development. The disciplinary organization of scientometrics is analyzed both conceptually and empirically. A state-of-the-art review of five major research threads is provided.

■

obtaining information for starting, granting or closing research projects,

■

selecting research priorities,

■

studying the structure of research in a country,

### The Disciplinary Organization of ‘Scientometrics’

Unlike the behavioral sciences and mainstream [philosophy of science](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/philosophy-of-science "Learn more about philosophy of science from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), scientometrics focuses on texts (documents) as empirical units of analysis. Figure 1 schematizes the relations with other disciplinary perspectives in science studies. Texts cannot be reduced to their authors – texts can, for example, be coauthored – nor can theories be reduced to the documents in which they are published. However, a measure in one dimension can be used as a proxy or indicator for the other given a research design.

As against texts or people, contents and theorizing remain latent and thus have to be theorized and hypothesized. Using factor analysis, however, one can reorganize data so that, for example, latent journal structures can be derived from the aggregation of citation linkages among journals. In Figure 2, we have applied techniques from network analysis to distinguish four communities in the citation networks among 32 journals that were cited by authors in *Scientometrics* during 2010. (All journals are included which contributed more than 1% to the total number of references in the journal *Scientometrics* during this year (2010).)

![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9780080970868850308-f85030-02-9780080970868.jpg)

Figure 2 shows that *Scientometrics* as a journal has mainly been situated within the information sciences. The *Journal of the American Society for Information* *[Science and Technology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/science-and-technology "Learn more about Science and Technology from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")* (JASIST) has become a major publication outlet for scholars in this field in addition to the more specialized journals (such as *Journal of* *[Informetrics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/informetrics "Learn more about Informetrics from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")* that was newly founded in 2007). However, the journal *Scientometrics* is the core journal in this field that interfaces with *[Social Studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/social-studies "Learn more about Social Studies from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")* *of Science*; a journal that mainly publishes qualitative science studies, and with general science journals (such as *Science* and *Nature*) and a number of journals that can be considered as part of technology and innovation studies (e.g., *R&D Management* and *Research Policy*). The relation with [social network analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/social-network-analysis "Learn more about social network analysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and organization studies is more remote, but also visible.

At the lower-left side of Figure 2, one also can see strong links to a group of major multidisciplinary journals (*Nature*, *Science*, *Proceedings of the National* *[Academy of Science](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/academies-of-science "Learn more about Academy of Science from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")* *of the* *[USA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/united-states-of-america "Learn more about USA from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")* *(PNAS)*) and physics journals (*Physical Review E* and *Physica A*). These journals mostly publish the research of network science researchers – physicists and applied [mathematicians](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/mathematicians "Learn more about mathematicians from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") – who discovered [bibliographic databases](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/bibliographic-database "Learn more about bibliographic databases from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") as resources and study objects at around the turn of the century. These developments in physics and mathematical statistics have become part of the relevant environments for scientometric research, but the relevant journals are positioned very differently from journals such as *Social Networks* and *Administrative Science Quarterly* (at the top-right side of Figure 2). In other words, scientometric research nowadays is at the crossroads among the social sciences, information science, and advanced computing with its efforts to capture patterns in ‘big data.’

### 2 A Metric of Science?

In 1978, the journal *Scientometrics* was launched as a new medium to stimulate the quantitative study of scientific communication. Derek de Solla Price, one of the founding fathers of the specialty, proclaimed in his introduction the development of scientometrics as the emergence of a ‘relatively hard’ social science. This claim has generated discussion from the very beginning of the specialty. In that same year (1978), leading sociologists of science published an edited volume entitled *Toward a Metric of Science: The Advent of Science Indicators*, dedicated to ‘ Paul F. Lazarsfeld (1901–76), Master of Quantitative and Qualitative Social Research’ (Elkana et al. 1978).

The systematic comparison of science indicators across fields of science was made possible by the creation of the *Science Citation Index* by Eugene Garfield of the Institute of Scientific Information (Garfield 1979). A preliminary version of this index became available in 1962. The creation of the database has stimulated the development of new perspectives on studies in various traditions. For example, the growth of scientific disciplines and specialties can be discussed in quantitative terms using this database (e.g., Price 1963), ‘invisible colleges’ can be explained in terms of network structures (Crane 1969), and theories of citations can perhaps be developed and tested (cf. Braun 1998).

The development of the specialty went hand in hand with the need for a means of legitimating science policies (Wouters 1999). Narin (1976) elaborated an instrumentarium for the systematic development of the biennial series of *Science Indicators* which the National Science Foundation of the USA began providing in 1972. (In 1987, the name of this series was changed to *Science and Engineering Indicators*.) With the further development of S&T policies in other nation-states and with the gradual emergence of such policies at the European level, scientometrics became a booming business during the 1980s. By comparing radio-astronomy facilities at the international level, Martin and Irvine (1983) showed the feasibility of comparing research groups in terms of quantitative performance indicators.

In a special issue of *Social Studies of Science* about performance indicators, Collins (1985) raised the question of the unit of analysis: what is being assessed in terms of what? The authors, the papers, or the cognitions shaped in terms of sociocognitive interactions among authors and discourses? In relation to French traditions of linguistic analysis, Callon et al. (1983) proposed using words and their co-occurrences instead of citations and co-citations (Small 1973) as units of analysis. Citations can be considered as subtextual codifications, while words indicate the variation at the level of texts. Words may change both in meaning and in terms of their observable frequency distributions.

### 2.3 Analytical methods

Over the last decades, scientometric methods have been widely applied in Safety research. As an emerging approach to Scientometrics, the concept of a scientometric analysis was first defined by Nalimov and Mulʹchenko (1971) as “a quantitative study of the research on the development of science” that can critically assess the State of the Art throughout scientific research using visualization techniques (Börner et al., 2003). This paper presents a scientometric analysis of the studies that apply SC approaches for emergency evacuation to create a comprehensive and [systematic overview](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/systematic-overview "Learn more about systematic overview from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of this research domain along with the literature distribution characteristics. The literature distribution characteristics, including the research subject type composition, total scientific production, collaborating authors and countries worldwide, number of authors’ affiliations and citations, are directly utilized in this method.

Next, the knowledge structure was investigated by employing co-occurrence methods. An analysis of fields, categories, and document citation networks has been automatically conducted using the scientometric software CiteSpace and [VOSviewer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/vosviewer "Learn more about VOSviewer from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). CiteSpace stands for *Citation Space* and was developed by Prof. Chaomei Chen (Chen, 2006; Chen et al., 2010). CiteSpace is the most widely used tool for scientific domain mapping (Li et al., 2021a). VOSviewer developed by Dr. Nees Jan van Eck and Prof. Ludo Waltman (Van Eck and Waltman, 2010) is a tool for scientometric visualization (Waltman et al., 2010). Both software packages have been used to perform a knowledge domain mapping analysis using [bibliographic data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/bibliographic-data "Learn more about bibliographic data from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (Li et al., 2022b; Van Nunen et al., 2018).

Additionally, keyword co-occurrence and cluster analyses were conducted to develop the framework for the critical review and to identify hot topics and frontier trends. Based on the textual data, a cluster analysis was performed (Waltman et al., 2010). Then, a critical review was carried out to explore the underlying semantic themes. The combination of critical review and cluster analysis can improve the objectivity of the literature review and provide a comprehensive understanding of the results (Zhong et al., 2019).

## [Informetrics at the beginning of the 21st century—A review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157707000740)

[2008, Journal of Informetrics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-informetrics)Judit Bar-Ilan

Hood and Wilson (2001a) provide an extensive discussion of the terms informetrics, bibliometrics and scientometrics. Webometrics, one of the newest metrics is discussed by Björneborn and Ingwersen (2004). They consider webometrics (studies of the Web) as a subfield of cybermetrics (studies of all Internet applications), however often these two terms are used as synonyms. In this paper we will use the more widely used terminology—webometrics, in the general sense of cybermetrics.
